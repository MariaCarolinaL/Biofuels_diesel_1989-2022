AB  - As a promising alternative biofuel, 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) has caused great concern recently. In this research, a new skeletal oxidation mechanism for DMF is built by merging the decoupling methodology with the reaction class-based global sensitivity analysis. First, the global sensitivity and path sensitivity analyses are used to identify the dominant reaction classes in the fuel-related submechanism of DMF. Then, the important isomers in the dominant reaction classes are chosen with the rate of production analysis. In addition, the vertical reaction lumping is performed to obtain global reactions for the reaction classes based on the steady-state assumption of the involved intermediate radicals. A skeletal C4-C6 submechanism is obtained. Based on the decoupling methodology, an original skeletal mechanism of DMF is constructed by adding the skeletal fuel-related sub-mechanism into a compact C0-C3 submechanism. Third, the reaction rate coefficients involving the fuel-related species are tuned within their uncertainty ranges through the genetic algorithm to ameliorate the predictions of the skeletal mechanism on autoignition times in shock tubes and key species evolution in jet-stirred reactors (JSRs). The final skeletal mechanism for DMF is obtained, consisting of 57 species and 212 reactions. The satisfactory agreement between the measurement and prediction shows that the final skeletal mechanism is able to well capture the ignition and combustion phenomenon of DMF under wide operating conditions. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Elemental carbon (EC) is a major light-absorbing component of atmospheric aerosol particles. Here, we report the seasonal variation in EC concentrations and sources in airborne particulate matter (PM) and snow at Alert, Canada, from March 2014 to June 2015. We isolated the EC fraction with the EnCan-Total-900 (ECT9) protocol and quantified its stable carbon isotope composition (δ13C) and radiocarbon content (∆14C) to apportion EC into contributions from fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning (wildfires and biofuel combustion). Ten-day backward trajectories show EC aerosols reaching Alert by traveling over the Arctic Ocean from the Russian Arctic during winter and from North America (&gt;40°N) during summer. EC concentrations range from 1.8–135.3 ng C m−3 air (1.9–41.2% of total carbon [TC], n = 48), with lowest values in summer (1.8–44.5 ng C m−3 air, n = 9). EC in PM (Δ14C = -532 ± 114‰ [ave. ± SD, n = 20]) and snow (−257 ± 131‰, n = 7) was depleted in 14C relative to current ambient CO2 year-round. EC in PM mainly originated from liquid and solid fossil fuels from fall to spring (47–70% fossil), but had greater contributions from biomass burning in summer (48–80% modern carbon). EC in snow was mostly from biomass burning (53–88%). Our data show that biomass burning EC is preferentially incorporated into snow because of scavenging processes within the Arctic atmosphere or long-range transport in storm systems. This work provides a comprehensive view of EC particles captured in the High Arctic through wet and dry deposition and demonstrates that surface stations monitoring EC in PM might underestimate biomass burning and transport. ©2020.

AB  - Linseed is a rich source of ω–3 fatty acids and high-quality protein. While in recent years, various industrial applications of linseed oil such as biofuels, are increasing. To find out appropriate sowing dates of two linseed cultivars, a four-year field experiment was accomplished during the growing seasons of 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 in Kermanshah, west of Iran. The results showed that the flowering period reduced with delay in planting that followed by exposure to the development of the seed and capsule ripening stages to higher environmental temperature and reduced grain yield consequently. In both cultivars, delays in the planting date also resulted in reductions in yield components. Delayed planting in both cultivars reduced the amount of α-linoleic acid and increased oleic acid. While was not observed significant changes in the total saturated and unsaturated fatty acids with a delay in planting date. In general, based on the results of this experiment, linseed can be cultivated in the region to produce a suitable seed and oil yield, while it should be noted that delay in planting, in addition to reducing yield, will reduce the quality of oil for industrial uses. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biofuels as alternative fuels in today’s world are becoming increasingly important for the reduction of greenhouse gases. Here, we present and evaluate the potential of a new alternative fuel based on the conversion of medium-chain fatty acids to biojet (MBJ), which was produced from coconut oil using hydrotreated processes. MBJ is produced by using both deoxygenation and isomerization processes. Several blends of this type of biojet fuel with Jet A-1 were run in a gas-turbine engine (Rover 1S/60, ROTAX LTD., London, England) for the purpose of investigating engine performance and emissions. Performance results showed almost the same results as those of Jet A-1 fuel for these fuels in terms of thermal efficiency, brake-specific fuel consumption, turbine-inlet temperature, and exhaust-gas temperature. The results of exhaust-gas emissions also showed no significant effects on carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbon, and nitrogen oxides, while a decrease in smoke opacity was found when blending MBJ with Jet A-1. MBJ performed well in both performance and emissions tests when run in this engine. Thus, MBJ brings hope for the development of aviation biofuels in tropical regions that have an abundance of bioresources, but are limited in technology and investment capital. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The green alga Botryococcus braunii produces abundant hydrocarbons, in the form of drop-in biodiesel, which promoted interest in the species as a renewable fuel. However, despite the observation of dense populations in the wild, Botryococcus grows very slowly in culture, severely limiting its potential for development as a bioresource. Undertaking a biodiscovery program, we found new strains of Botryococcus in locations ranging from tropical to temperate Australia and from both fresh and brackish waters. As part of the ecophysiological characterisation of this new biodiversity, lipid and pigment compositions were studied for six new strains from six di_erent locations. The strains were inoculated in either freshwater or brackish (salinity of 4)-based medium and maintained over 150 days. The growth of cultures was studied continuously, while lipid and pigment composition were analysed at final harvest on day 150. No significant di_erences in growth rate between fresh and brackish media were observed. Some strains were more tolerable of brackish conditions than others with a link between salinity tolerance and original location. The use of lower salinity (4 ppt) had a minimal effect on lipid composition, with only two of the six strains showing a different hydrocarbon profile in comparison to the other strains; pigment composition showed only minor variations for fresh and brackish water cultures, although the concentrations varied significantly with the freshwater cultures containing higher pigment concentrations. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - This study aims to utilize of waste cooking oil (WCO) as a vital energy source as an alternative source of power in operating agricultural machinery. In the current study, an alternative fuel was made of WCO and its suitability to apply in power farm machinery as mixture fuel blends with diesel fuel (D). The obtained biodiesel (BD) was blended with D based on the volumetric ratio and compared with D as a control treatment. The parameters in this study were biodiesel mixing ratios namely BD5 (5% BD + 95% D), BD20 (20% BD + 80% D) and D besides, throttle fuel position i.e., Idle, Half throttle fuel (H.L.) and Full throttle fuel (F.L.). The engine performance of reaper binder machine has been evaluated in terms of exhaust gases emissions and noise test. The value of Carbon Monoxide (CO) concentration decreased from 1005 to 893 ppm for D at H.L. and F.L. throttle fuel position compared with the value of CO concentration decreased also from 734 to 631 ppm for BD20 under above throttle fuel position. The Biofuel BD20 produced low exhaust emission values compared to D. The results revealed that using BD20 instead of D reduced the values of the noise level in case of the operator by percentages of 8.2, 9 and 5.4% respectively for Idle, H.L. and F.L. throttle fuel position, whereas, in case of bystanders, the corresponding values decreased by percentages of 9.4, 4 and 3.8%. © by PSP

AB  - The article describes the results of combustion of a mixture of PCOME (purified cooking oil esters) and bioethanol in the compression ignition Perkins 1104C-44 engine. The engine was prepared for use with the classic type of fuel - diesel oil, not biofuels. That is why bioethanol was added to ester in tests so that the basic physicochemical properties of the obtained mixture were as close as possible to diesel fuel. Thanks to this, the use of such fuel in the future would not require reworking or adjusting the settings of selected elements of the engine power supply system. During this case study, the engine performance and heat release rate were analyzed. For comparison, tests were carried out while powering the engine with ester fuel, 10 and 20 per cent mixtures of bioethanol and PCOME. The speed and load characteristics for each fuel were determined. This article presents selected characteristics where the biggest differences were noticed. © 2020 Polish Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The non-esculent soap stock oil was employed for producing some rare chemicals, along with certain fractions of biofuels akin to those engendered from petroleum sources. This inexpensive feed stock was hydrotreated using NiMo/Al2O3 in the sulfided form as a catalyst. The applied process was accomplished in a continuous micro-reactor, under high pressure of hydrogen. The hydroprocessed oil was treated chemically for separating its liquid hydrocarbons from the fatty acid constituents. The fatty acids were esterified to be transformed to the corresponding methyl ester. The products were identified via the gas chromatographic technique. The results reflect that the acquired hydrocarbons are clean and free from oxygenated compounds, in addition to sulfur, which has an adverse impact on the environment and on the performance of engines, so it can be used as a high - grade biofuel and also as pure chemicals. Furthermore, the prepared fatty acids are characterized by their low molecular weight, with carbon numbers in the range of C5 to C22, including those with odd carbon numbers that regarded as very rare components in nature. Hence this work offers the ability for obtainment precious products from a cheap material. ©2020 National Information and Documentation Center (NIDOC).

AB  - Jatropha biodiesel produced from Jatropha podagrica oil by alkaline-catalysed transesterification was blended with diesel in the ratios of 88:12 wt% (B88) and 12:88 wt% (B12). The fuel properties, consumption rate and exhaust gas emission characteristics of J. podagrica biodiesel, diesel and their blends were assessed. The results showed that J. podagrica seed oil have similar fatty acid profile with those of Jatropha curcas cultivated in Thailand and other South-East Asian countries. Blending of J. podagrica biodiesel and diesel enhanced the fuel properties of the blends, similar to those of the diesel. However, the B88 blend emitted lesser pollutants when compared to B12 and petrol diesel, making it very ideal for use as a promising alternative to the petrol diesel used in the mini tractor for farming activities. The results from the current study form a basis for further research on the use of B88 as a fuel source. © 2020 Technoscience Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rapid depletion of fossil fuels and escalating crude oil prices led the researchers to ascertain alternative feedstock as a substitute for mineral diesel. Biodiesel produced from non-edible sources was one among them. In the present investigation, palm stearin wax, a residue of palm oil extraction was used as a value-added feedstock for the production of biodiesel. Palm stearin biodiesel (PSBD) was derived from this feedstock using single stage transesterification process involving methanol and sodium hydroxide as a catalyst. PSBD was blended with mineral diesel at 20% (D80PSBD20) and 50% (D50PSBD50) in volume basis. The effect of variable compression ratios on the performance and emission phenomena of direct injection CI engine was analysed for test fuel blends. The tests were carried out for compression ratios 17:1, 17.5:1 and 18:1. Among all the fuel blends, D80PSBD20 blend showcased better performance characteristics along with reduced exhaust emissions at compression ratio of 18:1. © 2020 Technoscience Publications.

AB  - Meeting the transport needs of a growing world population makes it imperative to develop renewable and sustainable routes to production of liquid fuels. With a market-driven economic structure and pressing environmental issues, it is essential that these new routes provide environmental benefits while being economically viable. Conversion of second-generation lignocellulosic biomass resources to fuels via pyrolysis represents an important technological route. In this article, we report comparative assessment of the economic and lifecycle environmental aspects for catalytic and thermal pyrolysis. The goal of this assessment is two-fold: one is to understand the potential of this conversion route via the catalytic and thermal processes and second is to provide feedback for further development of catalysts for various stages of this conversion. The complete assessment is interdisciplinary in nature and connects the laboratory experiments with contextual sustainability assessment. Three catalytic and one thermal pyrolysis processes are analyzed using this assessment approach. Subject to the model choices and data inputs, the results, which consider quality of the oil product, show that biofuels produced using catalytic and thermal routes are rather expensive compared to gasoline. But at the same time, they provide significant greenhouse gas emission savings and can lead to lower CO2 abatement costs compared to the first-generation ethanol that is used currently. With one of the product scenarios of hydrotreated (HT) oil, the abatements costs are estimated to be 51% of those associated with first-generation ethanol. Additional product scenarios with developments in catalysts show potential to further reduce abatement costs significantly to below 100 EUR per metric tonne of CO2 equivalents. Using scenario analysis, the results help us to understand specific areas for development of novel catalysts. At the same time, the results demonstrate the trade-offs associated with the variety and complexity of technical factors associated with the pyrolysis routes. The study highlights the challenges and the promises of catalytic and thermal pyrolysis for production of high-quality biofuels produced via a sustainable production route. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Converting wastewater sludge to lipid is considered as one of the best strategies of sludge management. The current problem of lipid production from wastewater sludge is the low yield (0.10–0.16 g lipid/g dry sludge) due to the low availability of easily uptaken materials (such as soluble monosaccharide and oligosaccharide) in sludge to oleaginous microorganism (Rhodotorula glutinis, Trichosporon oleaginosus, Lipomyces starkeyi). Pretreatments are efficient methods to improve sludge bioavailability. This study is aimed to achieve high lipid production from sludge and high sludge reduction. Results: In this study, it was observed that the soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) had significantly increased after different pretreatment. The SCOD in the supernatant was increased from 32.64 to 180.25 mg/L, 924.16 mg/L, 1029.89 mg/L and 3708.31 mg/L after acidic (pH 2 for 2 h), alkaline (pH 12 for 2 h), microwave irradiation (15 min with 5 min interval), and ultrasonication (30 min at 450 W and 20 kHz frequency with 5 s on and 2 s off mode) pretreatment, respectively. Pretreatments have also increased the release of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) from solids. The sludge after different pretreatments were used as a medium for lipid production, and the highest lipid content (36.67% g/g) was obtained in the fermentation with ultrasonication pretreatment sludge, and the sludge reduction was 63.10%. For other pretreatments, the lipid content and sludge reduction were 18.42% and 32.63% in acid pretreatment case, 21.08% and 36.44% in alkaline pretreatment case, and 26.31% and 43.03% in microwave pretreatment case, respectively. Conclusion: It was found that ultrasonication pretreatment was the most efficient way to increase the sludge biodegradability (SCOD) and to release TN and TP from solid phase to liquid phase. Pretreated sludge for lipid production achieved significant improvement in lipid yield and sludge reduction. Lipids produced from pretreated sludge were transesterified to biodiesel and the analysis showed that biodiesel had a similar composition as commercial biodiesel. The study reveals that pretreatment on sludge is a promising method for enhancing biological sludge management efficiency.[Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Biofuels are a promising ecologically viable and renewable alternative to petroleum fuels, with the potential to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions. However, biomass sourced fuels are often produced as blends of hydrocarbons and their oxygenates. Such blending complicates the implementation of these fuels in combustion applications. Variations in a biofuel’s composition will dictate combustion properties such as auto ignition temperature, reaction delay time, and reaction pathways. A handful of novel drop-in replacement biofuels for conventional transportation fuels have recently been down selected from a list of over 10,000 potential candidates as part of the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Co-Optimization of Fuels and Engines (Co-Optima) initiative. Diisobutylene (DIB) is one such high-performing hydrocarbon which can readily be produced from the dehydration and dimerization of isobutanol, produced from the fermentation of biomass-derived sugars. The two most common isomers realized, from this process, are 2,4,4-trimethyl-1-pentene (α-DIB) and 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-pentene (β-DIB). Due to a difference in olefinic bond location, the α- and β- isomer exhibit dramatically different ignition temperatures at constant pressure and equivalence ratio. This may be attributed to different fragmentation pathways enabled by allylic versus vinylic carbons. For optimal implementation of these biofuel candidates, explicit identification of the intermediates formed during the combustion of each of the isomers is needed. To investigate the combustion pathways of these molecules, tunable vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) light (in the range 8.1–11.0 eV) available at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s Advanced Light Source (ALS) has been used in conjunction with a jet stirred reactor (JSR) and time-of-flight mass spectrometry to probe intermediates formed. Relative intensity curves for intermediate mass fragments produced during this process were obtained. Several important unique intermediates were identified at the lowest observable combustion temperature with static pressure of 93,325 Pa and for 1.5 s residence time. As this relatively short residence time is just after ignition, this study is targeted at the fuels’ ignition events. Ignition characteristics for both isomers were found to be strongly dependent on the kinetics of C4 and C7 fragment production and decomposition, with the tert-butyl radical as a key intermediate species. However, the ignition of α-DIB exhibited larger concentrations of C4 compounds over C7, while the reverse was true for β-DIB. These identified species will allow for enhanced engineering modeling of fuel blending and engine design. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - The study reports the CO2 emissions from diesel combustion in the following stages of the Brazilian ethanol supply chain: (a) agricultural operations (management), (b) sugarcane transportation to the mill, and (c) biofuel transportation to the destination. To assess the sensitivity of the results to different origins, five regions representative of ethanol production were selected, and the final destination was the port of Santos. The transportation stage from the mill to the port included the possible effects of using multimodal alternatives, such as road–rail and road–pipeline. The results indicate that diesel consumption varies greatly by region of origin, and agricultural management, such as tilling, planting, and harvesting operations, accounts for about 70% of total diesel emissions to the ethanol supply chain. Rail and pipeline transportation are ultimately important for mitigating emissions from fuel consumption in logistics corridors for exporting ethanol. It is a valuable contribution to supporting private actions and public policies related to the mitigation of emissions in the logistic stages of bioethanol, especially related to the optimization of the agricultural management process and improvement of the multimodal transport infrastructure, respectively. It is also a lesson to countries intending to produce ethanol from sugarcane. © MDPI AG. All rights reserved.

AB  - Organotin compounds are applied in several industrial reactions and can present antifungal and antibacterial activities. Incorrect handling and storage practices of biodiesel and diesel–biodiesel blends can lead to microbial development, impacting its final quality. Concerning this problem, this work investigated the antimicrobial action of two organotin catalysts used in biodiesel production with four isolated microroorganisms (Bacillus pumilus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudallescheria boydii, and Aureobasidium pullulans) and a pool of microorganisms (ASTM E1259 standard practice). Samples of soybean biodiesel with different concentrations of dibutyl tin dilaurate (catalyst 1) and di-n-butyl-oxo-stannane (catalyst 2) were prepared and added of mineral medium. The pool of microorganisms was inoculated and incubated at 30 °C and final biomass was weighted after 14 days. Thereafter, soybean biodiesel with catalyst 2 was used. Fungal biomass was weighted, and plate count was used to assess bacterial growth. Results show that catalysts 1 and 2 presented no inhibitory activity on the pool of microorganisms evaluated. A slight inhibitory activity was observed for B. pumilus and A. pullulans growth, but not for P. boydii, P. aeruginosa, or the pool of microorganisms. All experiment exhibited acidification higher than sterile control. Infrared analysis show less microbiological degradation products in the tin-protected fuel with ASTM inoculum. These results suggest that these tin-based catalysts show no toxic effect on native microbial population and a slight effect on some isolated microbial population in laboratory scale and for the first time shows that these organotin compounds can be employed safely as biodiesel catalyst.

AB  - Feedstock price and availability remain a barrier to adoption of cellulosic biofuels. Eucalyptus spp., can produce an energy-dense terpene suitable for high-density synthetic hydrocarbon-type fuel (grade JP-10) production in addition to cellulosic-based feedstock for traditional jet fuels (e.g., grade Jet A) and gasoline. This study modeled economic potential for Eucalyptus to fulfill US fuel markets. Cold-tolerant Eucalyptus was simulated in an annual coppice system for maximized leaf production. Results of the lowest simulated price ($110 t−1) show that within 10 years, there is potential to produce 204 million L yr−1 of fuel, including 51 million L yr−1 of JP-10-type fuel, 75 million L yr−1 of Jet A type fuel, and 77 million L yr−1 of gasoline. These quantities of fuel could be valued at approximately $500 million (USD), with feedstock costs totaling approximately $100 million (USD). Longer-term markets (to 20 years) or higher priced (to $220 t−1) scenarios show potential for more production. Research to determine potential for genetic improvement, delivered fuel costs, and biorefinery siting near existing infrastructure is recommended. © 2020

AB  - Abstract: A dynamic, plug-flow, one-dimensional, and heterogeneous mathematical model for a trickle-bed reactor is described and used to simulate the catalytic hydrocracking of non-edible vegetable oil with countercurrent operation mode. The reactor model considers the hydrocracking reaction of triglycerides towards renewable fuels, which is present in the hydrotreatment process of vegetable oils. The dynamic model was first validated using experimental data reported in the literature, which were obtained in an isothermal micro-scale reactor with cocurrent downflow during hydrocracking of Jatropha oil over a commercial CoMo catalyst. Then, the three-phase reactor model was applied to predict the dynamic behavior of an industrial hydrocracking reactor in order to gain some insight into the transient behavior of the liquid molar concentration, partial pressure, and temperature profiles, which were obtained and discussed as a function of time and axial position of the catalytic bed. The simulations obtained with the proposed dynamic model showed good agreement with the experimental data and trends previously reported for the operation variables profiles at steady-state and relevant findings at industrial scale were obtained. Graphic abstract: One of the main challenges to produce biofuels by vegetable oils hydroprocessing is to control the high-temperature gradients along the catalyst bed because of the high reaction heat released; therefore, the development of dynamic trickle-bed reactor models, as shown in this work, can be used as a tool to predict the operational behavior of the unit under different reaction conditions and layouts to found the best scheme to control the effects by high-temperature rise.[Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2020, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - Abstract: Lack of a reliable database and methodology for system development and evaluation with special consideration of social impacts has led to several challenges for lifecycle assessment for any project. Implementation of social science into projects, integrating social sustainability concerns into measures of human development, and investigating the impacts of the production process and the product chain on stakeholders are complex. This study develops a robust framework for social life cycle assessment, entitled the “Blended Lifecycle Integrated Social System” framework (BLISS). The BLISS method aims to develop an overarching framework that blends in the social aspect of the decision-making process and supports businesses in minimizing the harmful impacts of social objections on the industry and people’s lives. The new method is demonstrated here on algal biofuel production, with the integration of the weight of each production stage in the final product, studying a wide variety of stakeholders involved in the life cycle, including any relevant social criteria and understanding their connection with the production line and the stakeholders in a multi-criteria analysis framework. However, by combining product systems, indicators, and stakeholders, the new method results in a more robust solution by including social sustainability hotspots, development opportunities, and minimization of social objection on various types of projects.

AB  - Significant capital is spent removing and disposing of biomass detritus produced by natural disasters and invasive species infestations. This presents an opportunity to turn the cleanup of these endemic wastes into cost-effective, sustainable bioenergy. Using hurricane debris and invasive water hyacinth as case studies, the results of the presented analysis show that carefully designed, relocatable biofuel facilities that produce energy from biowaste can be cost-competitive and carbon-negative compared to status quo baselines. Techno-economic and carbon accounting analyses show that bioenergy can be economical and sustainable over a range of debris scenarios and facility parameters. Transportation modeling shows that by integrating collection, volume reduction, and transportation, delivered feedstock costs can be reduced by 30–87% compared to status quo costs. For the case of hurricane debris, electricity from biomass boilers and pyrolysis generators with 70% capital utilization are competitive with diesel generators at 4 MW and 1.5 MW scales, respectively. For water hyacinth, anaerobic digestion paired with a harvester that gathers, crushes, and bags plants directly on the water could produce useful heat for a net profit of $9/GJ while offsetting 3 tons CO2e per GJ. Ultimately, the present work shows that careful design and evaluation of bioenergy systems could enable an endemic Water and Storm Trash to Energy Via In situ Processing (WASTE VIP) system that reduces cleanup costs, increases energy security, and converts costly biomass waste into cleaner, cheaper energy. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Cold flow properties are the primary drawback to the common usage of biodiesel as an alternative fuel to diesel. Biodiesel's cold flow behaviour is discovered for the main reasons of presence of precipitant or crystal initiate by minor components such as monoglycerides and steryl glycosides. The ASTM test for this precipitant is ‘The Standard Test Method for Determination of Fuel Filter Blocking Potential of Biodiesel (B100) Blend Stock by Cold Soak Filtration Test (CSFT)’. Therefore, in this study, the performance of commercial activated carbon, silica and beach sand as adsorbent is studied in improving the filterability of two different level of refined biodiesel. The adsorbents were used to treat the biodiesel by removing the impurities present in the biodiesel such as the monoglycerides and steryl glycosides compound from biodiesel using adsorption technique. The efficiency of the adsorbent is determined by performing the cold soak filtration test. Based on the cold soak filtration test, precipitate is not visible and the CSTF is within the 360 s limit for the both refined level of biodiesel. However, treatment of these biodiesel with commercial activated carbon, silica and beach sand resulted in further reduce in CSFT. Commercial activated carbon found to be the most effective adsorbent, followed by silica. This is because both adsorbents possessed high surface area of 657.0420 m2/g and 320.2724 m2/g respectively and high pore volume of 0.379097 cm3/g and 0.952320 cm3/g respectively which further enhance its potential as an excellent adsorbent to improve the filterability of biodiesel compared to beach sand which possessed lowest surface area and lowest pore volume of only 1.2630 m2/g and 0.001751 cm3/g respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A system consisting of a last-generation Stirling engine (SE) and a fuel burner for distributed power generation has been developed and experimentally investigated. The heat generated by the combustion of two liquid fuels, a standard Diesel fuel and a rapeseed oil, is used as a heat source for the SE, that converts part of the thermal energy into mechanical and then electric energy. The hot head of the SE is kept in direct contact with the flame generated by the burner. The burner operating parameters, designed for Diesel fuel, were changed to make it possible to burn vegetable oils, not suitable for internal combustion engines. The possibility of adopting different configurations of the combustion chamber was taken into account to increase the system efficiency. The preliminary configurations adopted allowed to operate this integrated system, obtaining an electric power up to 4.4 kWel with a net efficiency of 11.6%. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - The petroleum product has seen a drastic demand in the recent past. Biofuels are the only solution to overcome this power crisis. In the view of sustainable energy development, biodiesel and its additives have become the best options for fossil fuel-based engines. In this work, a biodiesel mix was used to show the possible utilization of different biofuels. An experimental investigation was carried out on a direct-injection constant-speed (Rated speed-1500 rpm) diesel engine at different injection pressures of 180, 220 and 260 bar with natural aspiration and supercharging modes. The blends of Biodiesel (used cooking oil, with a mix of algae) and diesel fuels are the selected fuel to investigate. At lower injection pressures, brake specific fuel consumption of the engine was low and further lowered with supercharging operation. With the reduction of injection pressures, brake thermal efficiency values are improved, and the same was observed with supercharging. With the rise in injection pressures, NOx emissions increased due to rise in temperature, and unburnt hydrocarbon emissions were slightly increased. The algae biodiesel was used as an additive to increase the stability of biodiesel. The overall observation indicates that a moderate injection pressure of 220 bar is advisable. © 2020, Shahid Rajaee Teacher Tarining University (SRTTU). All rights reserved.

AB  - This study investigated the influence of fuel absorption on the mechanical properties of glass-fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) composite. Three types of fuel, namely, aviation fuel, biofuel, and a blended fuel mixture between kerosene and biofuel, were used to perform complete immersion on the GFRP specimens through immersion-bath technique. The degradation of the tension and compression properties of GFRP composite caused by fuel attack were experimentally investigated. Three types of aviation fuel were used to environmentally age the GFRP specimens through immersion-bath technique. The GFRP specimens were manufactured using vacuum-assisted resin-transfer molding to achieve a volume fraction of 0.55 with <1% void content. The mechanical performance of the specimens were then evaluated by immersing them to the saturation point before performing tensile and compression tests. Results showed that the immersed specimens for all fuel solutions had slightly decreased tensile and compressive strengths and modulus compared with an as-received (non-immersed) specimen. This indicated the ability of GFRP composites in resisting the corrosive nature of fuels. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Increasing renewable carbon incorporation into conventional fuels through coprocessing with vacuum gas oil (VGO, a petroleum refining feedstock) is a critical step in biofuel development, scaling-up, adoption, and associated GHG reduction. Optimization of the coprocessing parameters maximizes incorporation of the renewable carbon in the fuel products. Quantitative determination of the renewable carbon content in the coprocessed products provides direct evaluation of these parameters. The coprocessing bio-oil with VGO through hydrocracking (HC) or fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) system resulted in carbon isotopic fractionation that prevented the direct use of the isotope-mixing model for quantifying the renewable carbon. Here, we report an algorithm of using a stable carbon isotope approach to quantify the renewable carbon content in coprocessing biofuel products through high-precision δ13C analysis. A controlled experiment carried out by blending a fossil diesel (-29.013‰) with a biodiesel (-30.099‰) at various blending levels up to 98.0/2.0 wt % is presented and has demonstrated the applicability of this approach. The carbon isotope fractionation factors for the bio-oil coprocessing were obtained by using a 14C-derived isotope-mixing model. The δ13C method was tested by coprocessing 13C-labeled biocrude and natural woody biomass-derived fast pyrolysis (FP) and catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) bio-oils with VGO. The results were verified by 14C accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) method (ASTM-D6866) and compared with the yield mass balance method. Strong agreement between δ13C and 14C AMS methods demonstrated the applicability of the δ13C method to quantify renewable carbon content in coprocessing fuel products and guide the coprocessing optimization. ©

AB  - Filamentous microalga Tribonema sp. has the advantages of highly resistance to zooplankton-predation, easy harvesting, and high cellular lipid content, in particular large amounts of palmitoleic acid (PA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Therefore, Tribonema sp. is considered as a promising biomass feedstock to produce biodiesel and high-value products. In this work, we studied the effect of different concentrations of nitrogen (NaNO3: 255-3 060 mg/L), phosphorus (K2HPO4: 4-240 mg/L), iron ((NH4)3FeC12H10O14: 0.6-12 mg/L) and magnesium (MgSO4: 7.5-450 mg/L) on the biomass, lipid content, and fatty acid composition of Tribonema sp. FACHB-1786, aiming at enhancing cell lipid productivity. The growth of Tribonema sp. had a positive correlation with the concentration of magnesium, and the maximum biomass of Tribonema sp. (under the condition of 450 mg/L MgSO4) was 8.09 g/L, much greater than those reported in previous studies using the same and other Tribonema species under autotrophic conditions. Different nitrogen concentrations exerted no significant effect on algal growth (P &gt; 0.05), but a higher nitrogen concentration resulted in a greater amount of lipid in the cells. The maximum volumetric productivities of total lipids (319. 6 mg/(L•d)), palmitoleic acid (135.7 mg/(L•d)), and eicosapentaenoic acid (24.2 mg/(L•d)) of Tribonema sp. were obtained when the concentrations of NaNO3, K2HPO4, (NH4)3FeC12H10O14, and MgSO4 were 765 mg/L, 80 mg/L, 6 mg/L, and 75 mg/L, respectively. This study will provide a reference for substrate optimization for Tribonema sp. growth and lipid production. © 2020, Science Press. All right reserved.

AB  - Petroleum-derived fuels such as diesel, natural gas and coal have been the main sources of energy for the global energy matrix. Due to this, there is a necessity to implement new technologies to increase biofuel production from renewable sources, such as the use of soybean oil. The aim of this study was to evaluate the profile of the companies that were established to produce B100 biodiesel in Brazil from 2005 to 2015. The research was developed using data from scientific articles, master's dissertations and PhD theses, statistical yearbooks, laws and decrees in force. It also used data collections published by the government agencies and representative entities from the biodiesel sector for the elaboration of a correlation matrix for average prices of biodiesel, diesel oil and soybean oil. The average B100 biodiesel prices between 2011 and 2015 have been lower than the average selling prices from soybean oil. Currently, the biodiesel unit comprises 71.14% large production units, 20.31% medium production units and 8.55% small production units of B100 biodiesel. The participation of transnational companies in the biodiesel market is responsible for a significant portion of the installed production capacity in Brazil. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - To reach its greenhouse gas emission reduction goals, Norway needs a shift away from the use of fossil fuels in the transport sector. The production potential and efficiency of Fischer-Tropsch biofuels and hydrogen from gasified wet organic municipal solid waste has been investigated. The carbon capture potential was estimated for both production processes and the number of road vehicles compared, which can be supplied with the fuel. Gibbs free energy minimisation is used to predict the synthesis gas composition. A detailed analysis of the different gas treatment processes that lead to either gasoline and diesel production, along with energy recovery as electricity, or hydrogen in either compressed or liquefied form is conducted. Both processes can utilise all available waste heat and the Fischer-Tropsch biofuel process is even self-sufficient with electrical power. The production of hydrogen has both higher first and second law efficiencies and a greater number of vehicles can be supplied with fuel. Either 2367 tonne H2 or 1497 tonne gasoline, 1279 tonne diesel, and 1.33 MW of net electric power can be produced at 1073 K gasification temperature, where both yield and efficiencies are highest. Hydrogen production also has the larger carbon capture potential during fuel production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel emulsion fuel is reported as one of the most feasible options capable of generating lower NOx emission than that from fossil fuels. However, oil and water in the emulsion fuel are easily separated and unstable. The aim of the present study is to consider the production and stability of biodiesel emulsion fuel by using tetraglycerin ester (CR-310), i.e., one of lipophilic surfactant, polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR) and biodiesel, i.e., Waste cooking Oil Methyl Ester (WOME) produced based on waste cooking oil. The corresponding heat rate, water content, and viscosity are measured. Emphasis is placed on the effects of water content and surfactant on biodiesel emulsions. It is found that: (i) stable emulsion fuel is obtained by adding at least 2.0% of CR-310 and is maintained over 1 month, (ii) there is no effect of water content on stable emulsion fuel if CR-310 is used over 2.0%, and (iii) the viscosity of emulsion fuels is higher than that of the biodiesel fuel and is gradually increased with an increase in the water content. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The recovery of noble metals from electrical wires and cables results in waste materials such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyethylene (PE), that is, waste insulation electrical cables (WIEC), which have been processed by gasification for energy recovery. This study focused on the effect of blending the ratio of WIEC on the gasification feedstock composition and the lower heating value (LHV) of produced syngas, through controlled tests and tests under different loads on the generator. The controlled gasification experiments were carried out at blending ratios between pine biomass and WIEC of 90:10, 80:20, and 70:30 and with pine biomass only (100%). For the loads gasification, the experiments were carried out at a blending ratio of 80:20. The controlled experimental results presented that the highest hydrogen content, approximated 17.7 vol.%, was observed at a blending ratio of 70:30 between pine biomass and WIEC and the highest LHV of syngas was observed at a blending ratio of 90:10, with 5.7 MJ/Nm3. For the load gasification experiments, the results showed that the highest hydrogen content was obtained with a load of 15 kW in the generator, approximately 18.48 vol.% of hydrogen content, and the highest LHV of synthesis gas was observed during the 5 kW test, with 5.22 MJ/Nm3. Overall, the new processing of waste insulation electrical cables using a downdraft gasification reactor demonstrates great promise for high quality syngas production. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The increasing number of studies on the usage of egg-shell-derived Calcium Oxide (CaO) as a catalyst for biodiesel production highlights the need to investigate the effects of temperature on the calcination of egg shells. To this end, the present study investigates the calcination of chicken and duck egg shells exposed to different temperatures of 800°C, 900°C, and 1000°C for one hour. The synthesized CaO was characterized by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier-Transform Infrared spectrometry (FT-IR), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), and Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). This study showed that there were changes in the distribution and formation of calcium, oxides, and the naturally occurring substance carbon during calcination of the samples. It was observed in both chicken and duck egg shells that 800°C was a decent temperature for calcinating egg shells to produce calcium oxide catalyst. © 2020 Sharif University of Technology.

AB  - The Chlorella sp. biodiesel was produced from the microalgae oil via transesterification process. Three combinations were studied. Blend of biodiesel (20%) with diesel (80%) was prepared and denoted as B20. Then the TiO2 nanoparticles were added to each B20 blend samples in a quantity of 50 and 100 ppm using an ultrasonicator. In compliance with the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) fuel requirements, the biodiesel blends have been characterized. In an unaltered four-stroke diesel engine using various loads, the biodiesel blends were studied. The experimental outcomes show a decrease in exhaust emissions in terms of CO, HC, NOx, and Smoke. © 2020 Scientific Publishers. All rights reserved.

AB  - Endophytic fungi live in symbiotic association with plants for at least part of their life. They are potential agents for the production of new and bioactive compounds, as well as for the use in agriculture, medicine and industry. Endophytic fungi produce Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), which are low molecular weight compounds that readily evaporate at normal temperatures and pressures. Fungi are not only capable of producing a wide variety of volatile compounds, they are also able to metabolize them and they have a great importance in chemical ecology. Mixtures of VOCs produced by endophytic fungi are mainly composed by alcohols, aldehydes, esters, aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, terpenoids, nitrogen and sulfur compounds. They can be used in biotechnological applications such as biofuels, mycofumigation, alellochemicals, flavor in food and in the chemotaxonomic identification of fungi. The objective of this mini review was to perform a search in the literature on the endophytic fungi producing VOCs and their biotechnological potential. © 2020 Sociedade Brasileira de Quimica.

AB  - Rice husk is counted as an agricultural waste that results in environmental problems during its handling. In this work, rice husk was used as raw material for producing liquid biofuel (pyrolysis oil) via pyrolysis. The pyrolysis reaction was carried out at temperatures of 450, 500, and 550 °C for 1 hour. The pyrolysis oil was collected and weighted for every 10 minutes. The results showed that the increase in pyrolysis temperature caused the yield of pyrolysis oil to increase. The properties in the term of heating value also increased while viscosity and density of pyrolysis oil decreased. These properties were almost similar to diesel oil with a slightly lower heating value. The proposed model using the single reaction model and two stages model were fit to represent the mechanism of rice husk pyrolysis reaction in this study. However, the results of two stages model gave a lower error than those of the single reaction model. Furthermore, the rate of pyrolysis reaction at various temperatures could be determined using the kinetic data obtained from the developed model. This information would be useful for designing the pyrolysis reactor especially for producing biofuel (pyrolysis oil) from the rice husk. © 2020, Iranian Institute of Research and Development in Chemical Industries.

AB  - Macroalgae with several species are an abundant, carbon-neutral renewable resource and rich in carbohydrates which make it suitable for biobutanol production. Recently, due to advantages of biobutanol as a liquid biofuel, it can be used as a substitute for gasoline and diesel. Many researches mentioned that, different Clostridium species are able to use fermentable sugars for production of biobutanol from different biomasses through ABE (Acetone-Butanol- Ethanol) fermentation process. In this study the (Sargassum sp.) was used as carbon source for biobutanol production. Thirty-three anaerobic mesophilic isolates were isolated on RCM medium from five soil cultivated with different crops. Only thirteen spore forming, mesophilic, anaerobic Clostridium isolates used for the fermentation process. 100 g/L from Sargassum sp. were hydrolyzed by sulfuric acid (6 % (v/v)) followed by thermal pretreatment at 121°C for 20 minutes to produce total reducing sugars (24.151 ± 0.273 g/L), which were fermented by Clostridium isolates. The most promising isolate (HG1) which produce the highest butanol level, acetone and ethanol (3.743, 1.401 and 1.031 g/l) respectively was identified according to Butanol dehydrogenases (bdhA) gene analysis as Clostridium acetobutylicum. This paper emphasizes the importance of (Sargassum sp.) as a renewable feedstock for the biobutanol production. © 2020 National Information and Documentation Center (NIDOC)

AB  - Green chemistry and sustainability are important concepts to incorporate into the undergraduate chemistry curriculum. Through the development of innovative undergraduate chemistry research projects in these areas, retention of students in the physical sciences can be improved. This paper describes two projects in undergraduate catalysis research: hydrogenation of furfural and the esterification of biooil from pyrolyzed wood. Catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) of furfural with Pd/C led to the production of furfuryl alcohol, furfuryl isopropyl ether, 2-methylfuran, and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol. The metal chloride additives improved selectivity for furfuryl alcohol and furfuryl isopropyl ether. Catalytic conversion of pyrolyzed wood biooil in ethanol with a solid acid catalyst yielded ethyl esters, including ethyl acetate and ethyl propionate, as characterized by GC/MS These projects are described in the context of engaging undergraduate students in hands-on research for the purpose of improving retention and persistence, as well as preparing young scientists to enter graduate programs and the STEM workforce. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020.

AB  - This work presents a novel, robust procedure for the semi-automated counting of colony-forming units of Bacillus pumilus (a bacterium) and Meyerozyma guilliermondii (a yeast) both isolated from diesel oil. The counting is performed from digital images of Petri dishes containing the samples by a developed Python code, and the images are acquired from a low-cost scanning apparatus. The counting algorithm is based on the similar morphological characteristics of the bacterium and the yeast colonies. It was compared with classical counting methodology, and the results showed calibration and validation curves with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.99 and 0.98, respectively. The developed methodology is a valuable alternative to estimate the microbial contamination of biofuels. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The article is devoted to a study of the issues related to the processes of reducing the greenhouse gas emissions using different types of biofuels. The dynamics of carbon dioxide emissions in the global energy sector were ana-lyzed and it was determined that a stable level of the CO, emissions in the last three years is due to introduction of the technologies with the use of renewable energy sources by developed countries. It was proven that the assess-ment of total greenhouse gas emissions requires an analysis of emissions throughout the life cycle of a biofuel. The impact of a biofuel on the climate change depends on the raw material from which it is produced, and which has a decisive influence on its chemical composition and performance. It was established that a significant role in ensur-ing energy security and preventing climate change is attributed to the development of biotechnologies, unrelated to the risks of agricultural production. The use of a biofuel from lignocellulose raw material may be more efficient in terms of reducing the greenhouse gas emissions. A biofuel, obtained from the processing of microalgae, also has important prospects. The ability of microalgae to bind atmospheric carbon dioxide may have a positive effect on solving the problem of greenhouse effect. © (2020). All rights reserved.

AB  - Manipulating specific nutrients in growth media to boost production of lipids or carotenoids in microalgae is a widespread practice; however, it decreases overall biomass productivity, an important consideration for viable production of biofuels. In the present study, maximum productivity of lipids (117.01 mg/L/d) and biomass (249.60 mg/L/d) was obtained on day 13 in Bold's basal medium (BBM) modified by adding 25 mM NaCl and 20 μM phosphate. Lutein and astaxanthin productivity was, however, only slightly different from that in the standard medium, namely blue-green-11 (BG-11). The lipids profile was dominated by C16:0 and C 18:1 fatty acids ranging from 26.69 to 39.32% and 10.8–35.31% (palmitic and oleic acids) in all the five variants of the culture medium. These results indicate that the highest proportion of saturated fatty acids (SFA; 61.02%) was obtained in BG-11 whereas that of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA; 37.34%) was obtained in BBM supplemented with NaCl (50 mM) and phosphate (20 μM). All the five variants led to lipids suitable for biodiesel production, marked by a lipid profile dominated by the two fatty acids. It is concluded that making the culture medium more saline and enriching it with phosphates increased lipid and biomass productivity and the synthesis of fatty acids methyl esters (FAME). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the last decades, efforts to reduce the use of fossil fuels have increased the search for alternative sustainable sources of renewable energy. In this scenario, hydrocarbons derived from fatty acids are among the compounds that have been drawing attention. The intracellular production of hydrocarbons by bacteria derived from cold environments such as the Antarctic continent is currently poorly investigated, as extremophilic microorganisms provide a great range of metabolic capabilities and may represent a key tool in the production of biofuels. The aim of this study was to explore the ability of bacterial cells derived from extreme environments to produce hydrocarbons with potential for further use as biofuels. Seven bacteria isolated from Antarctic samples were evaluated for hydrocarbon production using GC–MS approaches. Two isolates, identified as Arthrobacter livingstonensis 593 and Pseudoalteromonas arctica 628, were able to produce the hydrocarbon undecane (CH3-(CH2)9-CH3) in concentrations of 1.39 mg L−1 and 1.81 mg L−1, respectively. Results from the present work encourage further research focusing on the optimization of hydrocarbon production by the isolates identified as producers, which may be used in further aircraft biofuel production. This is the first report on the production of the undecane compound by bacteria isolated from waterlogged soil and sponge from Antarctica. © 2020, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Fungi accumulate intracellular lipids in excess of their biomass. In the present study, endophytic fungi associated with plants that are used to produce biodiesel, namely, Jatropha curcas, Pongamia pinnata, Sapindus mukorossi, Mesua ferrea, Terminalia bellerica, Cascabela thevetia, and Ricinus communis were screened for total lipid production. The lipid content in the endophytic fungi Lasiodiplodia exigua SPSRJ27, Phomopsis sp. SPSRJ28, Pestalotiopsis microspora SPSRJL35, and Phomopsis sp. SPSRJL36, were found to be more than 20% of their dry biomass, an indicator of being oleaginous. Saturate, aromatic, resin, and asphaltene (SARA) analysis showed that L. exigua had the lowest amount of asphaltene weight percent, while Phomopsis sp. SPSRJL36 had the highest asphaltene stability. P. microspora contained the lowest sulfur content, higher heating value was found to be more than 35 MJ/kg in L. exigua, P. microspora, and Phomopsis sp. SPSRJL36, while Phomopsis sp. SPSRJ28 had a value less than 35 MJ/kg. L. exigua, Phomopsis spp., and P. microspora, when optimized for growth, showed a high amount of biomass and lipid content under static conditions. Significant differences (p < 0.05) in lipid content were observed among the fungal isolates L. exigua, P. microspora and Phomopsis spp. Genes of biomass-deconstructing carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZys) showed variable banding patterns among the isolates. The present study revealed that the growth manipulation of oleaginous fungal endophytes opens up avenues for their larger exploration as biofuel minifactories. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - 3-Carene is an important potential biofuel with properties similar to the jet-propellant JP-10. Its thermal decomposition and combustion behavior is to date unknown, which is essential to assess its quality as a fuel. A combined experimental and kinetic modeling study has been conducted to understand the initial decomposition of 3-carene. The pyrolysis of 3-carene was investigated in a jet-stirred quartz reactor at atmospheric pressure, at temperatures varying from 650 to 1050 K, covering the complete conversion range. The decomposition of 3-carene was observed to start around 800 K, and it is almost complete at 970 K. Online gas chromatography shows that primarily aromatics are generated which suggests that 3-carene is not a good fuel candidate. The potential energy surface for the initial decomposition pathways determined by KinBot shows that a hydrogen elimination reaction dominates, giving primarily cara-2,4-diene. Next to this molecular pathway, radical pathways lead to aromatics via ring opening. The kinetic model was automatically generated with Genesys and consists of 2565 species and 9331 reactions. New quantum chemical calculations at the CBS-QB3 level of theory were needed to calculate rate coefficients and thermodynamic properties relevant for the primary decomposition of 3-carene. Both the conversion of 3-carene and the yields of the primary products (ie, benzene and hydrogen gas) are well predicted with this kinetic model. Rate of production analyses shows that the dominant pathways to convert 3-carene are hydrogen elimination reaction and radical chemistry. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - For the purpose of reducing both NOx and smoke from diesel engine exhaust, the blendings of gasoline into diesel/biodiesel mixture were studied to determine the optimal ratio of diesel/biodiesel/gasoline at various speeds and loads under different exhaust gas recirculations (EGRs) in an electronic-controlled common-rail injection turbocharged diesel engine. With blending biodiesel, the modification of EGR suppressed the NOx emission but increased the opacity at higher load. With the increase in gasoline addition, the biodiesel proportion needs to be higher for promoting the oxidation of soot. Considering the emission reductions of opacity and NOx, as well as the issues of cost and lubricity, it is recommended that 20% biodiesel and 5% gasoline would be the optimal blending ratio. © 2020, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - Abstract: The preparation, characterisation and application of two catalysts active in selective hydrogenation (Pt/TiO2) and esterification (mesoporous SiO2 material modified with tethered sulfonic acid groups) reactions is described. The catalysts are characterised using a range of spectroscopic, microscopic and adsorption techniques. Pt/TiO2 catalysts promote valeric acid (a cellulose derived platform molecule) hydrogenation to pentanol, while –SO3H modified mesoporous SiO2 catalysts convert valeric acid/pentanol mixtures to pentyl valerate (a 10-C molecule which can be used as a diesel fuel substitute). Admixtures of the two catalysts catalyse the tandem conversion of valeric acid/hydrogen mixtures to form pentyl valerate in a single reaction. A rationale for the observed reactivity, selectivity and carbon balance is proposed.

AB  - The preparation of biofuels by catalytic hydrogenation from the pyrolysis products of Swida wilsoniana oil was studied. The catalytic hydrogenation process was investigated and optimized by single factor test and response surface experiments. The optimum parameters obtained by single factor test were catalyst dosage 1.0%, reaction temperature 170℃, reaction pressure 2.0 MPa, reaction time 150 min and the maximum conversion was 96.3%. The optimal parameters obtained by response surface experiments were catalyst dosage 1.05%, reaction temperature 173℃, reaction pressure 2.0 MPa, and the highest catalytic conversion rate was 98.1%. It was found by GC-MS, elemental analysis and FT-IR that after hydrogenation, alkanes increased by 8.15 percentage points, oxygen content decreased from 10.502% to 2.392%, and biological hydrocarbon compounds increased significantly, with the mass fraction of 95.12%. At the same time, the carbon chain C3-C7 in biofuels increased by 4.31 percentage point and C8-C19 increased by 18 percentage point compared with that of pyrolysis products. The product structure was closer to the existing fossil fuels. © 2020, Editorial Board of «Chemistry and Industry of Forest Products». All right reserved.

AB  - Large quantities of enzymolysis lignin (EL) is produced with the development of cellulosic bioethanol. Valorization of EL is of important significance for the sustainable development of the plants. In this work, hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of EL to bio-oil was proposed aided by the in situ hydrogen production via aluminum-water reactions. Results showed that reaction temperature had remarkable effect on the reactivity of aluminum powder in subcritical water, and most of the aluminum was oxidized to boehmite at temperatures over 340 °C with high hydrogen yield. In situ HDO of EL over NiMoS/Al2O3 catalyst decreased the yield of phenolics and ketones, but increased the yield of aromatic hydrocarbons in the bio-oil. In addition, the properties of the bio-oil were also improved via in situ HDO process. The feasibility of aluminum-water reactions as in situ hydrogen source was proved with EL as a promising feedstock for aromatic biofuels production. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A modular experiment for upper-level undergraduate students is presented, featuring the product cycle and process evaluating the quality and quantity of biodiesel obtained from a microalgae feedstock grown under carbon-supplemented and nutrient-deprived conditions. Batch reactors are used to cultivate and harvest microalgae, which undergo acid-catalyzed in situ transesterification to produce biodiesel. Methods are presented to quantify yield and analyze products via gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. With an awareness of the limited time available in a teaching laboratory, this experiment was designed and successfully implemented in an undergraduate biochemistry course over four sessions. Reflux reactions were performed in hermetically sealed microwave vials, eliminating water usage and reducing glass breakage. Learning objectives were assessed by postcontent quizzes, and written reports using a rubric based on Bloom's taxonomy, results of which indicate a demonstration of the higher-order cognitive abilities of Evaluation and Analysis. The ability to biochemically engineer cultivation conditions to influence lipid production gives this experiment the potential to be offered as a course-embedded undergraduate research experience (CURE) project. This easily adoptable experiment offers an engaging opportunity for students to experience the technical and societal aspects of emerging biofuel technologies.

AB  - This study reports a simple and convenient analytical method for the simultaneous determination of biodiesel and vegetable oils or used cooking oils in petrodiesel and green diesel (hydrotreated vegetable oils or paraffinic diesel). The approach is based on normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with refractive index detection. It employed silica stationary phase, n-hexane mobile phase with isopropanol modifier to achieve optimum separation between hydrocarbons (petrodiesel or green diesel), fatty acid methyl esters (biodiesel) and triglycerides (vegetable oils and used cooking oil). In addition to determining vegetable oils or used cooking oils as adulterants in diesel, this method is also proposed as a better alternative to the standard method ASTM D7371, which is currently recommended for determining fatty acid methyl esters in petrodiesel. The method development involved screening of various stationary and mobile phases, with and without modifiers, to achieve acceptable chromatographic resolutions between analytes. Under the optimized method conditions, silica column, and n-hexane containing 0.6% isopropanol as the mobile phase provided the best results. The real-world scenario was simulated for the method validation carried out by fortifying Jatropha seed oil, soybean oil, and used cooking oil in the biodiesel blended petrodiesel and green diesel. Measurement of all analytes was accompanied by high precision, low limit of detection/quantification and linear response range of 0.05 to 50% for biodiesel, and 0.05 to 30% for vegetable oils. The proposed method is simple, fast (runtime 7 min), and does not require sample pre-treatment and backflushing. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Combustion sources have been shown to directly emit particles smaller than 10 nm. The emission of 1-3 nm particles from biofuel or fossil fuel cookstoves has not been studied previously, nor have the radiative impacts of these emissions been investigated. In this work, emissions (number of particles) were measured during a water boiling test performed on five different cookstoves (three-stone fire, rocket elbow, gasifier, charcoal, and liquified petroleum gas [LPG]) for particle diameters between ∼1 and ∼1000 nm. We found significant emissions of particles smaller than 10 nm for all cookstoves (&gt;5 × 1015 # kg-fuel−1). Furthermore, cleaner (e.g., LPG) cookstoves emitted a larger fraction of sub-10 nm particles (relative to the total particle counts) than traditional cookstoves (e.g., three-stone fire). Simulations performed with the global chemical transport model GEOS-Chem-TOMAS that were informed by emissions data from this work suggested that sub-10 nm particles were unlikely to significantly influence number concentrations of particles with diameters larger than 80 nm that can serve as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) (&lt;0.3%, globally averaged) or alter the cloud-albedo indirect effect (absolute value &lt;0.005 W m−2, globally averaged). The largest, but still relatively minor, localized changes in CCN-relevant concentrations (&lt;10%) and the cloud-albedo indirect effect (absolute value &lt;0.5 W m−2) were found in large biofuel combustion source regions (e.g., Brazil, Tanzania, Southeast Asia) and in the Southern Ocean. Enhanced coagulation-related losses of these sub-10 nm particles at sub-grid scales will tend to further reduce their impact on particle number concentrations and the aerosol indirect effect, although they might still be of relevance for human health.

AB  - There is a growing awareness of the need to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and the inevitable depletion of fossil fuel. With the market pull for the growth in sustainable and renewable alternative energy, the challenge is to develop cost-effective, large-scale renewable energy alternatives for all energy sectors, of which transport fuels are one significant area. This work presents a summary of novel methods for integrating kraft mills with a hydrothermal liquefaction process. The application of these methods has resulted in a proposed kraft mill-integrated design that produces a liquid fuel and could provide net mitigation of 64.6 kg CO2-e/GJ, compared to conventional petrol and diesel fuels, at a minimum fuel selling price of 1.12–1.38 NZD/LGE of fuel, based on the case study. This paper concludes that a hydrothermal liquefaction process with product upgrading has promising economic potential and environmental benefits that are significantly amplified by integrating with an existing kraft mill. At the current global kraft pulp production rate, if each kraft mill transforms into a biorefinery based on hydrothermal liquefaction, the biofuel production is an estimated 290 Mt (9.9 EJ). © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - In aero-engines, the introduction of biofuels is among the best alternatives to fossil fuels, and this change is likely to affect the impact of droplets on interposed surfaces. Under this framework, this work reviews the main morphological hydrodynamic structures occurring upon the impact of a liquid droplet on a wetted surface, using jet fuel and biofuel mixtures as alternative fuels. The experiments performed allow investigating the effect of the liquid film thickness on the dynamic behavior of single drop impact, considering the relevancy of these phenomena to the optimization of engine operating parameters. Particular emphasis is given to the occurrence of crown splash, and the morphological differences in the outcomes of drop impact depending on the impact conditions and fluid properties. The four fluids tested included pure water (as reference), 100% Jet A-1, 75%/25%, and 50%/50% mixtures of Jet A-1 and NExBTL (Neste Renewable Diesel)-with the Weber impact number between 103 and 1625; Reynolds values 1411-16,889; and dimensionless film thicknesses of δ = 0.1, 0.5, and 1. The analysis on the secondary atomization for the different fluids evidences the predominance of prompt and crown splash, and jetting for alternative fuels. Finally, besides a systematic review of empirical correlations for the transition to splash, we investigate their universality by extrapolating the validation range to evaluate their ability to predict the outcome of impact accurately. One of the correlations studied show the highest degree of universality for the current experimental conditions, despite its limitation to thin liquid films (δ =0.1) © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Biofuel production becomes a sustainable developmental strategy, when wastelands are reprocessed as prospective mass culture sites (PMCS) for microalgae feedstock. Remote Sensing (RS) data and field visits were used to delineate eutrophic water bodies for PMCS. The floodplains of the Brahmaputra River Valley of Assam, India, were selected as PMCS and were defined using RS data. A green alga of the genus Parachlorella was isolated from an algal bloom present in the drainage system, of Tezpur University, Assam, India. The species was cultured in representative water samples from the PMCS and growth was monitored in open laboratory conditions against the control. The microalgal biomass was characterized and subjected to in situ transesterification. The fuel properties such as viscosity, density, calorific value and cetane number (CN) were determined to assess the fuel quality. The results showed the biodiesel fuel properties were within the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) purview. Additionally, the thermo-chemical conversion and subsequent characterization underscored the feasibility of bio-oil production from open laboratory culture of microalgae. This study highlights the practicability of combining RS data and experimental appraisal for cost effective, environment friendly and sustainable biofuel production, from microalgae cultured in wasteland PMCS. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The potential of microalgae Spirulina platensis to the production of nitrogenous compounds in liquid fraction via slow pyrolysis was evaluated. Aiming to identify the best condition which maximized liquid yield, the effects of operational conditions mass load, temperature, and heating rate were evaluated using Experimental Design and Response Surface Methodology techniques and optimized with Differential Evolution methodology. The composition of liquid fraction was analyzed by GC–MS and the effect of the same operational conditions in nitrogenous compounds formation was analyzed. The separation of nitrogenous compounds was evaluated by extraction and adsorption techniques. The results indicated that the heating rate significantly impacted both the liquid yield and the formation of the nitrogenous compounds. At optimal conditions, a maximum liquid yield of 64.59% was obtained. The extraction and adsorption processes showed to be promising routes for the purification of nitrogenous compounds, however, extraction was more selective to separate them. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Without oxygen, there would be no combustion. Yet the crucial role of oxygen in energy systems has been largely underrepresented. The oxygen-dependence of fuel caloricity is used to derive energy-based metrics that challenge the prime facie objective of maximising biofuel mass yields—an objective that currently dominates the biofuel industry. Application of two energy metrics, namely the change in energy quality (ΔEQ) and the energy yield (ΔEη), demonstrates that any improvement in energy quality of combustibles must accompany increases in combusted oxygen (mO2), as ΔEQ=[Formula presented]−1, and that ΔEη is a function mass yield, η, and mO2: ΔEη=η([Formula presented]). Literature data produced mostly positive ΔEQ values: biocrude achieved the highest (126.3%), followed by bioethanol (107.7%), and catalytic pyrolysis (78.3%). Most data produced similar changes in energy yield per mass yield, ΔEη/Δmη ranging from 0.7 for biodiesel to 1.6 for bioethanol. Carbon yields and overall mass yields are demonstrated to be poor metrics for biofuel synthesis, and could undermine biofuel quality, hampering progress for conversion technologies aimed at producing biofuels. Biodiesel mass yields in particular were found to be inflated by as much as 73%. As such, ΔEQ and ΔEη are useful for cross-field comparison of biofuels. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Cyclopentanone is a promising biofuel that can enable more efficient engine operation and increase the fuel economy of the light duty fleet over current and planned technology developments. While the ignition of cyclopentanone has been investigated in detail, more studies on the laminar burning velocities of cyclopentanone are called for. In this work, the laminar burning velocities of cyclopentanone (C5H8O) have been measured using the heat flux and spherical flame methods at 1 atm, equivalence ratios from 0.7 to 1.6, and initial temperatures of 328, 353, and 428 K. To further investigate the relationship between the molecular structure and laminar burning velocity, identical experiments were also performed for binary mixtures of cyclopentanone with ethanol and n-propanol at 1:1 (mol). The consistency between the experimental data sets obtained in this work and literature data sets has been evaluated. A recently published mechanism of cyclopentanone was used for simulation after adopting the submechanism of n-propanol. Good agreement has been seen between experimental and simulated results for all flames. To qualitatively explain the characteristics of the laminar burning velocity of cyclopentanone and the differences with those of ethanol and n-propanol, sensitivity analysis and reaction pathway analysis have been performed to compare the chemistry of the fuels under flame conditions, which revealed how the molecular structure of cyclopentanone could affect its laminar burning velocity. Compared to ethanol and n-propanol, cyclopentanone does not have primary carbon atoms in its molecule, leading to lower production of methyl radicals. Meanwhile, the carbonyl group in the cyclopentanone molecule is mostly released as CO in the decomposition of multiple intermediates accompanied by the production of unsaturated C2 and C4 species, especially C2H4 and C2H3. Both features contribute to the high laminar burning velocity of cyclopentanone. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Diesel engine generators are one of the major methods for off-grid and on-demand electricity generation, particularly in the remote areas of some developing countries. However, access to fossil diesel is often limited by supply or price. In many regions, biomass is an abundant source of energy, but many types are not suitable for producing traditional liquid biofuels such as biodiesel. This paper explores the use of so called ‘slurry fuels’ produced by the blending of micron sized particles of carbonaceous material in diesel and assesses whether these ‘slurry fuels’ can be used in a standard diesel engine generator with minimal modification. Two types of micronized carbon chars were added to diesel, produced by either pyrolysis or hydrothermal carbonization of biomass. The results indicated that at high engine power, the micronized carbon slurry fuels can be run at a similar efficiency as pure diesel. The major issues identified included high engine wear and the blockage of the fuel injector. Hydrothermal carbonization was found to be the best thermal conversion route for producing micronized carbon in terms of emissions when blended with diesel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Combustion, noise and vibrations produced by n-Butanol and Oleic Acid Methyl Ester (MO) in Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition (RCCI) were investigated. The Cetane Number was determined using a Constant Volume Combustion Chamber (CVCC) for MO100, ULSD, and n-Butanol and found to be 73.8, 47.2, and 16 respectively. In the case of the MO20Bu80 (Methyl Oleate 20% with 80% n-butanol), the maximum Apparent Heat Release Rate was higher compared to ULSD Classical Diesel Combustion (CDC), due to accumulation of fuel in the combustion chamber because of the longer ignition delay and cylinder and charge cooling effect of n-butanol. RCCI with Methyl-Oleate had a vibrations level of as much 4.5 (m/s2) higher than ULSD in CDC up to 2k Hz. The sound level found by the Acoustic Array sound level for MO20Bu80 in combustion was 4 (dB) louder than ULSD in CDC. RCCI was found to have its own acoustic spectrum compared to CDC, and this is because of the wider range and higher sound levels produced by RCCI. The study suggests that MO can be used as a surrogate fuel for full body biodiesel in RCCI combustion. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - For sustainable production and consumption, emerging green technologies must be optimized in order to achieve a minimal environmental impact, a maximal economic impact, and dynamic behavior. The need for environmentally sustainable production and consumption is now one of the main developmental goals. To enable a more sustainable production in the chemical sector, new green chemical technologies from renewable feedstock such as furfural (a chemical compound produced from biomass used as a building block in the production of biofuels) are currently being developed. Furfural, a versatile chemical, is also employed as a solvent, an extractant base for fungicides, and a platform for other compounds. In this work, the simultaneous optimization of design parameters and control properties, which are highly relevant targets according to the principles of green chemistry, is performed within the reaction zone in the production process of furfural from biomass. The Differential Evolution with Taboo List algorithm (DETL) is used to carry out the multiobjective optimization. The total annual cost (TAC), eco-indicator 99 (EI99), and condition number, which represent the objective functions for a sustainable process, are combined as economic, environmental, and controllability criteria, respectively. Based on the results, the operating conditions found allow for an acceptable furfural production of 2014.4 kg/h, which reduce costs by 39% and its environmental impact by 42% in a system with satisfactory control properties compared to a case base. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The research attempts to analyze the influence of S. Marginatum algae biodiesel, used in a diesel engine with additives. Transesterification was used to prepare biodiesel from microalgae to mix with standard diesel at a rate of 20% (vol.) called B20. The nanofluid Al2O3 was prepared and tested along with B20 under different loads at a speed of 1500 rpm in a direct ignition diesel engine for their combustion characteristics. It is concluded that fuel mixtures of Al2O3 nanofluids confirmed better combustion on a CI engine compared to B20 mix. © 2020 Scientific Publishers. All rights reserved.

AB  - In heavily forested rural areas, tax-incentivization programs are commonly employed to encourage timber production and harvesting activities. Because of growing interest in developing woody-biomass-based biofuels in the Western Upper Peninsula of Michigan, USA, we analyzed property records to determine who the regional actors are along with what role tax-incentivization programs may play. We found that a minority of entities collectively control 77 percent of the land in the region; however, family forest owners collectively own 23 percent of the land. Although taxincentive programs are commonly used by commercial forests, the requirements of the primary program in Michigan program appear to preclude most family forests in the region. Accordingly, this study suggests that a greater understanding of reluctance of family forests to enroll in secondary programs is needed, or a lowering of forestland requirements to permit more family forests to enroll. Study Implications: In heavily forested rural areas, the development of local forest resources has been suggested as a means of developing the local economy. One means of using the forest resources is through the development of woody-biomass-based biofuel or bioenergy programs. As these programs are dependent upon harvesting to supply the relevant feedstocks, tax-incentivization programs, such as Michigan's Commercial Forest Land (CFL), may be used to encourage commercial timber production and overcome resistance to harvesting by nonindustrial private forest (NIPF) owners. These findings suggest such programs are likely to be well to fully subscribed by commercial forests. However, the implementation of these programs (ex., minimum of 40 ac. of forestland) may preclude a significant number of family forests from being able to enroll, which may be a contributing factor to low subscription rates. As a result, policymakers wishing to encourage enrollment by family forests in tax-incentivization programs should consider the practical realities of regional family ownership (i.e., average forestland acreage) in developing the programs. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Biodiesels are the fuels formed using different natural materials which are freely available on the earth. With the use of these natural materials different biodiesels with different characteristics can be obtained. In the present scenario biodiesel is known to be the best replacement of fossil fuels like diesel used in automotive industries. Biodiesel can be obtained from different sources like animal oil, vegetables, plants etc. and can fulfill the required need to industry. In the current study different biodiesel blends are used in the simulation study with the use of Diesel-RK Software. Various IC Engine performance parameters were studied under this simulation which resulted in the improvement in the performance of IC Engine with less emission of toxic gases using biofuel. This study reveals various parameters affecting the performance of diesel engine. © 2020 Alpha Publishers.All rights reserved.

AB  - Increasing energy demand and decreasing availability of fossil fuels along with growing concerns regarding environmental issues have boosted the production of biofuels, including biogas. In the present study, we aimed to produce biogas using mixtures of crude glycerol, stillage, and swine wastewater as substrates in order to evaluate their effect on wastewater treatment efficiency and gas yield. The optimal mix of these substrates was determined and the kinetics of biogas production was analyzed. The most desirable results in terms of methane production and removal of organic matter from the wastewater were obtained when using concentrations of 5% glycerol and stillage. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - One of the possible choices as a biomass for lignocellulosic bioethanol production are different perennial grasses. Cultivating this type of biomass has many advantages in terms of natural diversity and landscape protection. In this study, mixture of red clover and timothy grass was used as a feedstock to investigate its potential as a substrate for bioethanol production. Traditional three step bioethanol production process was used in combination with NED pretreatment. The results show at all pretreatment temperatures similar glucose concentrations and hydrolysis efficiencies, which varied from 4.3 to 5.1 g/l and 15.2 % to 17.7 %, respectively. The ethanol yield, on the other hand, decreased as the pretreatment temperature increased. However, the mass balance revealed that when using this kind of feedstock, 3.3-4.0 g ethanol could be produced from 100 g of biomass. The overall efficiency and yield of the process was lower than expected due to pretreatment, which might not have been suitable for soft biomass. © 2020 Merlin Raud, Timo Kikas.

AB  - Jatropha curcas is a natural non-food resource with high oil-content seeds, that has attracted worldwide attention as it is an ideal renewable resource for the production of biofuels. With the increasing use of vegetable insulating oil in related industries, it is valuable to develop the vegetable insulating oils from Jatropha curcas seed oil. This study explores how to use Jatropha curcas seed oil to prepare high-quality natural vegetable insulating oil. A six-step process is first established according to the optimization results of alkali refining, activated clay treatment and alumina treatment of Jatropha curcas seed oil, combined with cold treatment, water washing and high temperature decompression treatment. Physicochemical and electrical performance tests show that most of the properties of the prepared vegetable insulating oil are significantly improved compared with the original seed oil, and meet the standard requirements for vegetable insulating oil, especially with no sulfur corrosion, a breakdown voltage of 72 kV and an acid value (KOH, potassium hydroxide) of 0.012 mg/g. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - An operating automotive engine generates more friction as well as wears in between their sliding parts when compared to an idle one, and so needs lubrication to lower this particular frictional impact. Biodiesel is surely an alternative renewable source of diesel fuel. The current research will measure the friction and wear characteristics of benthic-diatom Navicula sp. algae biodiesel with RuO2 at various concentrations. The biodiesel was studied at various blends such as B20, B20+50 ppm, and B20+100 ppm. Tests had been carried out at a speed of 1200 rpm at 75 °C under an average load of 40 kg per 1 h. Results revealed that friction and wear decreased with an increase in the concentration of RuO2 nanoparticles in biodiesel. © 2020 National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources (NISCAIR).

AB  - Abstract—Camelina or false flax (Camelina sativa) is one of the most promising oilseed crops as a feedstock for biofuel production. It is thought that this species originated in the Eastern European region, where this species emerged due to polyploidization or crossing between wild representatives of the Camelina genus. As a result, camelina is characterized by a low level of genetic diversity, which imposes limitations on breeding and improvement of this crop. Although there are some studies discussing genetic polymorphism among the existing camelina cultivars, the assessments of Ukrainian genotypes are scarce, although this region belongs to the center of C. sativa’s origin. For the first time, an integrated assessment of genetic diversity among Ukrainian camelina breeding lines and cultivars, as well as analyzed the morphometric and yield parameters of their seed oil and its fatty acid composition, has been performed. Based on the results of chromatographic analysis, two camelina genotypes (FEORZhYaF-2 and FEORZhYaFD) with seed lipids to a greater extent composed of fatty acids with a short carbon chain (below C18) have been distinguished. Genetic distances between the studied genotypes have also been identified using ISSR, SSR, and ILP (actin and β-tubulin) markers. The obtained data were compared with the crop productivity and morphometric parameters, which allowed for differentiating the most promising pairs of phenotypes for further cross breeding. For example, crossing the FEORZhYaF-2 and FEORZhYaFD breeding lines with the cultivars Mirazh and Peremoha in different combinations may hypothetically provide the trait of heterosis in the first generation. This approach to the analysis of camelina breeding samples and genetic resources may become a powerful instrument for improving the given oil-bearing crop. © 2020, Allerton Press, Inc.

AB  - In this research work, the characterization of the palm stearin biodiesel was made using Nuclear Magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FITR) and GC/MS methods. Analysis of the composition of fatty acids was done using the GCMS apparatus based on the retention time. Fourier transform infrared spectrometer was used for the spectrum analysis of the various functional groups and bands located in it. The properties of the palm stearin biodiesel were predicted adopting the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards. Measured values of the properties were the density at 18°C as 0.88 g/m3, kinematic viscosity at 35°C as 3.4 mm2/s, the calorific value of the palm stearin as 37121 kJ/kg and the flash and fire points of the biodiesel as 130°C and 160oC respectively. The rapid and correct characterization of the palm stearin biodiesel was made by the NMR. © 2020 Technoscience Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - The use of straw for biofuel production is encouraged by the European Union. A previous study showed the feasibility of producing biomethane in upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors using hydrolyzed, steam-pretreated wheat straw, before and after dark fermentation with Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus, and lucerne. This study provides information on overall microbial community development in those UASB processes and changes related to acidification. The bacterial and archaeal community in granular samples was analyzed using high-throughput amplicon sequencing. Anaerobic digestion model no. 1 (ADM1) was used to predict the abundance of microbial functional groups. The sequencing results showed decreased richness and diversity in the microbial community, and decreased relative abundance of bacteria in relation to archaea, after process acidification. Canonical correspondence analysis showed significant negative correlations between the concentration of organic acids and three phyla, and positive correlations with seven phyla. Organic loading rate and total COD fed also showed significant correlations with microbial community structure, which changed over time. ADM1 predicted a decrease in acetate degraders after a decrease to pH ≤ 6.5. Acidification had a sustained effect on the microbial community and process performance. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Due to climate change and energy security concerns, bioenergy products and systems are becoming increasingly important, and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) can provide a better understanding of their carbon efficiency. In this study, we used a cradle-to-grave LCA to analyze the carbon efficiency of a cottonwood-switchgrass agroforest system grown on agriculturally marginal soils on three sites established in 2009 in the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley (LMAV). A complete carbon inventory was done for both the agroforestry bioenergy system and a control cropping system that rotated soybeans and grain sorghum. Three years after establishment, the cottonwood sequestered the highest amount of carbon in dead roots, live roots, and surface residues (3222 kg ha-1) and the switchgrass sequestered the highest amount of carbon in above-ground biomass (4233 kg ha-1). The maximum carbon was emitted (1733 kg ha-1) from the soybean/grain sorghum rotation production system. The carbon emission during production was not statistically different for the bioenergy crops. Carbon emission from both bioenergy crops were significantly different compared to traditional agricultural crops. At the end of the third growing season, cottonwood showed the best performance in the net (6.2) and gross (11.8) ratios of carbon balance. The gross ratio of carbon by switchgrass (11.6) was comparable to cottonwood, but the net ratio was approximately 50% (3.3). The net and gross ratios of carbon balance were positive for the control cropping system as well, 1.2 and 2.2 respectively. Carbon emission from the traditional agricultural production system was at least 234% higher compared to the dedicated bioenergy production system. It was evident that bioenergy crops provide a more environmentally efficient practice in terms of carbon balance than the traditional agricultural practice in the Lower Mississippi alluvial Valley. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Feedstock genetics and environment are important factors determining biomass yield of biofuel crops. Field studies were conducted to evaluate agronomic performance of four energy cane (Saccharum spp. hybrid) genotypes (TUS11-62, TUS11-58, TCP10-4928, and Ho 02-113) in the Texas Rolling Plains. In the first study, cane billets were planted in 2015 and data were collected from first (2016) and second (2017) ratoons. A second study was planted in 2016 and data were collected the same year from plant cane. Data collected include biomass, stalk height, stalk population, leaf area index (LAI), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Biomass yield of ratoons was not significantly different (p &gt;.05) among genotypes. However, TUS11-58 had the highest plant cane yield. The average biomass yield of plant cane, first, and second ratoons were 20.2, 40.4, and 26.4 t ha−1 respectively. Longer growing period of ratoon (∼8 mo) compared to plant cane (∼5.5 mo) increased biomass. However, low temperatures (−14 to −16 °C) during the dormant phase resulted in lower yield of the second ratoon. Among genotypes, TUS11-62 had taller stalks, but was cold sensitive. Genotype TCP10-4928 had higher stalk population and LAI. An exponential relationship was observed between LAI and NDVI (R2 =.67). Overall, there were differences in growth characteristics of energy cane genotypes, however biomass yield was similar in the ratoon phase. The results of this study showed that low temperature tolerance and growing season duration are key factors in determining biomass yield in higher latitude regions such as the Texas Rolling Plains. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - This paper presents the ‘process blocks build-up estimating’ method for the capital cost estimation of biorefineries at Technology Readiness Levels 2 to 3 with a −50% to +100% accuracy, corresponding to a Class 5 estimate. Through systematic cost modeling, the method introduces a modular approach to cost estimation by breaking down a biorefinery into its major process blocks and using separate cost power functions. Suitable cost parameters (exponents and reference capital costs) for 11 biochemical, chemical and thermochemical biorefinery types are developed, as well as reference block efficiencies for estimating the costs of biorefineries within and beyond the state of the art. A framework for uncertainty modeling is also proposed to decide on contingencies for a biorefinery investment. The cost models are addressed to the biorefinery community, from experimental chemists to process engineers and decision makers, to assist them in selecting optimal pathways and budgeting new projects. The modular estimation approach is illustrated with a simple example on a biodiesel plant and a first-of-a-kind polyhydroxybuturate (PHB) plant. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Biodiesel offers several environmental benefits and improvements to some fuel performance properties, but its poor oxidative stability has been a major concern. Currently, the accepted practice to improve biodiesel oxidative stability is the addition of antioxidants; numerous antioxidants have been studied but their effectiveness in inhibiting biodiesel oxidation is difficult to predict due to variation with resonance stability, solubility, reactivity, and volatility. To improve prediction efforts, this study explored the Rapid Small-Scale Oxidation Test (RSSOT) as a means to investigate how biodiesel oxidation is affected by antioxidant concentration and temperature, and compared its results with the oxidative stability index test. A weak correlation was identified due to antioxidant variation. A kinetic model expressed in temperature and induction period was developed for biodiesel before high-vacuum distillation (HVD), after HVD and also after HVD with three concentrations of propyl gallate (PG) and tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) antioxidants. The approach was validated by comparing collected data on the oxidation of methyl oleate with kinetic parameters found in the literature. Antioxidant concentrations from 130–930 ppm were tested, and the results revealed that the apparent activation energy of biodiesel oxidation increases with increasing concentration of primary antioxidants and decreases during vacuum distillation. When treated with an increasing concentration (130–930 ppm) of PG and TBHQ, the apparent activation energies of a vacuum distilled biodiesel changed from 108.46 ± 4.45 to 112.72 ± 1.46 kJ·mol−1 and from 77.14 ± 2.25 to 89.91 ± 2.29 kJ·mol−1, respectively. These observed trends agree with both the accepted mechanism of primary oxidation of fuels and mode of action of primary antioxidants. © 2020 AOCS

AB  - Biodiesels produced from various feedstocks have been considered as alternative fuels used in internal combustion engines without major modifications. This research focuses on producing biodiesel from waste cooking oil (WCOSD) by the catalytic cracking method using MgO as the catalyst and comparing the engine operating characteristics of the test engine when using WCOSD and traditional diesel (CD) as test fuels. As a result, the brake power of the test engine fueled WCOSD, and traditional diesel is similar. However, the engine fuel consumption in the case of using WCOSD is slight increases in some operating conditions. Also, the nitrogen oxides emissions of the test engine fueled WCOSD are higher than those of CD at all tested conditions. The trend is opposite for hydrocarbon emission as the HC emission of the engine fueled by WCOSD reduces 26.3% on average. The smoke emission of the test engine in case of using WCOSD is lower 17% on average than that of CD. However, the carbon monoxide emissions are lower at the low and medium loads and higher at the full loads. These results show that the new biodiesel has the same characteristics as those of commercial biodiesel and can be used as fuel for diesel engines. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Traditional global powers like the European Union and the United States are seeing the rise of emerging powers like Brazil as prospective cooperation partners. Examining how traditional powers are perceived by their emerging counterparts offers critical insights into the prerequisites for effective and durable partnerships. While the literature on external perceptions has expanded considerably, a comparative perspective on how emerging powers perceive the policies of the two transatlantic powers in issue-specific areas is lacking. We present a framework of explanatory variables (legitimacy, coherence and negotiating style) and apply it to interview data and the literature to unravel Brazil's relations on biofuels with the EU and US, including through trilateral partnerships with third countries. Our data show that while Brazil's partnership with the US has progressed, the one with the EU has struggled to advance. Our paper seeks to explain these differences using our framework, advance understanding on the external perceptions of the international role and collaborative posture of the EU and US, and provide policy insights for the fruitful conduct of partnerships. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: While keeping in view various aspects of energy demand, quest for the renewable energy sources is utmost. Biomass has shown great potential as green energy source with supply of approximately 14% of world total energy demand, and great source of carbon capture. It is abundant in various forms including agricultural, forestry residues, and unwanted plants (weeds). The rapid growth of weeds not only affects the yield of the crop, but also has strong consequences on the environment. These weeds can grow with minimum nutrient input requirements, have strong ability to grow at various soil and climate environments with high value of cellulose, thus can be valuable source of energy production. Results: Parthenium hysterophorus L. and Cannabis sativa L. have been employed for the production of biofuels (biogas, biodiesel and biochar) through nano-catalytic gasification by employing Co and Ni as nanocatalysts. Nanocatalysts were synthesized through well-established sol-gel method. SEM study confirms the spherical morphology of the nanocatalysts with size distribution of 20-50 nm. XRD measurements reveal that fabricated nanocatalysts have pure standard crystal structure without impurity. During gasification of Cannabis sativa L., we have extracted the 53.33% of oil, 34.66% of biochar and 12% gas whereas in the case of Parthenium hysterophorus L. 44% oil, 38.36% biochar and 17.66% of gas was measured. Electrical conductivity in biochar of Cannabis sativa L. and Parthenium hysterophorus L. was observed 0.4 dSm-1 and 0.39 dSm-1, respectively. Conclusion: Present study presents the conversion of unwanted plants Parthenium hysterophorus L. and Cannabis sativa L. weeds to biofuels. Nanocatalysts help to enhance the conversion of biomass to biofuel due to large surface reactivity. Our findings suggest potential utilization of unwanted plants for biofuel production, which can help to share the burden of energy demand. Biochar produced during gasification can replace chemical fertilizers for soil remediation and to enhance the crop productivity. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - The current challenge of drop-in jet fuel should couple the reduction of GHGs emission in whole life cycle with economic competitiveness and achieving performance as same as traditional jet fuel without reducing safe service life in engine and aircraft. From the insight of GHGs reduction, the whole life cycle, including sustainable feedstock, refining process integration and low emission in combustion are optimized for reduction in energy input and emission output. From the insight of airworthiness in aero-engine and aircraft, a certification process is achieved by extracting safety criteria from the “history experience” of petroleum-based jet fuel as the source and to predict the aero-engine safety implications of alternative aviation fuels as the target by “similar analogy”. The critical key parameters have been extracted by fundamental process related with safety and performance on achieving the duty of engine in the whole flight envelop. Alternative jet fuel can be qualified for certifying drop-in jet fuel and accordingly confirm with identical safe service life in engine and aircraft by analogizing the boundaries of critical key parameters with petroleum-based jet fuel. The critical parameters thereof, including carbon distribution and classification as well as C/H ratio, can conduct directly for feedstock choice and refining process modification. Accordingly, a process of refining algae-based jet fuel was modified coupling the requirement of GHGs reduction in life cycle with airworthiness in aero-engine and aircraft. Based on process integration to connect upstream feedstock to downstream combustion outcomes of alternative jet biofuel and co-product, GHGs in fuel stage deduced further by co-product and nutrient recovery in spite of additional separation process. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the present paper, an integrated continuous process of biodiesel manufacturing is proposed using Aspen Plus simulator for different feedstocks. Majority of the reported simulation models in literature are design models for new processes by fixing some level of equipment performance such as the conversion in reactor. Most models assume the feed oil as pure triglycerides or some fatty acids and the biofuel as pure ester. In order to optimize the production of biodiesel, similarity with reality is necessary. For this purpose, this work uses thermophysical property estimation of glycerides, rigorous reaction kinetics, phase equilibrium for separation and purification units, and prediction of essential biodiesel fuel qualities. Detailed operating conditions, equipment designs, and properties of feed and products were obtained. The reactions and parameters kinetics were applied to represent both methanolic and ethanolic transesterification of the biodiesel production. An evaluation of optimal operating conditions (time, temperature, alcohol: oil ratio) for a CSTR reactor was determined. The optimal conversion was achieved at a temperature of 60 °C, 6.00 mol/mol alcohol-oil ratio and 2.0 h residence time when used methanol transesterification reaction as 88.19, 93.77, 89.43, and 89.25%, respectively for sunflower, soybean, palm and macauba oil, on the other hand 86.09, 80.26, 76.54, and 76.39% for transesterification ethanolic. Most of the biodiesel obtained from the simulations presented adequate according to the specifications of the D6751, ANP 45, and EN 14214 standards. Finally, the model proposed can be used for improving operations conditions, new products design and help economic analysis in continuous processes of biodiesel production. © 2020 De Gruyter.

AB  - Biodiesel is susceptible to oxidation reaction since it has unsaturated esters in its composition. Studies have shown that small traces of transition metals are able to promote biodiesel oxidation. Biodiesel samples containing Cr3+, Co2+, Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions, in the presence and absence of rosemary extract, were submitted to the Rancimat test at 110 °C to verify the biodiesel oxidative stability against the catalytic action of these ions. The results were compared with control samples with and without rosemary extract. The control without extract presented induction period of 8.29 hours and the control with extract 11.42 hours. Regarding the catalytic effect of metal ions in biodiesel and in the absence of extract, the sample containing Fe3+ showed induction period of 0.25 hours, indicating total degradation of the biofuel. For the samples containing the other cations, in the absence of the extract, the catalytic effect followed the order Fe2+&gt;Cr3+&gt;Co2+. In the presence of extract the order presented was Fe3+&gt;Fe2+&gt;Co2+&gt;Cr3+. © 2020 Sociedade Brasileira de Quimica. All rights reserved.

AB  - Currently, the use of biofuel as an alternative energy source for the operation of tractors and cars is becoming increasingly relevant. The use of biofuel is a promising area for the needs of many sectors of the national economy, including the agro-industrial complex. This is due to two problems: first, the global oil reserves are being depleted, and second, the burning of petroleum products causes environmental pollution and serious environmental consequences. The article focuses on the issues of assessing various oil crops for the production of biofuel. In contrast to the favorable conditions in Ukraine, Germany, France, the USA, and Brazil, where rape, soy, and sunflower are used for the production of biofuel, safflower is more suitable for obtaining renewable plant material for the production of biofuel in the arid conditions of cultivation. It has been found that, while many other crops die of drought, safflower forms high and stable yields at the level of 1.2 t/ha, while the more hydrophilous sunflower and spring rape sharply reduce their productivity in arid years - 0.8 and 0.5 t/ha, respectively. The research performed by the specialists of the Saratov State Agrarian University (SSAU) during many years have scientifically substantiated the feasibility of growing specifically safflower seeds for the production of biofuel (mixed diesel fuel) in the Lower Volga steppe zone. Safflower oil-based biofuel has low viscosity; it can have a positive effect on the performance of the fuel equipment in tractor units. The performed production tests have shown that when the engine is running on mixed diesel fuel containing 20% of safflower oil and 80% of diesel fuel, no reduction of the engine power is observed, while the service life of fuel equipment increases, and the amount of harmful emissions into the atmosphere decreases. © 2020 Polish Society of Ecological Engineering (PTIE).

AB  - An alternative for reducing emissions from marine fuel is to blend bio-oil from lignocellulose non-edible feedstocks to diesel fossil fuels. Phase diagrams of the ternary systems were built to represent the transition from heterogeneous regions to homogeneous regions. Four homogeneous blends of bio-oil of eucalyptus-bioethanol-marine gasoil were experimentally characterized with respect to the most important fuel parameters for marine engines: water content, flash point, low heating value, viscosity, and acidity. Blends with closer properties to marine gasoil replacement, lower costs, and environmental impacts should be tested for large engines. © 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - The incomplete combustion of fossil fuels generates hazardous gaseous compounds which have been linked to various adverse environmental and human health effects worldwide. Cleaner alternatives such as gas-to-liquid (GTL) and biofuels such rapeseed oil methyl ester (RME) have therefore been investigated. In this study, a Combustion Aerosol Standard (CAST) was used to generate a diluted, consistent and relatively stable source of fuel emissions from the combustion of diesel, GTL and RME, respectively. Gas phase sampling was carried out by removing particulates using a filter upstream of three different samplers: i) a commercialised activated charcoal sampler; ii) a validated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) sampler; and iii) a novel graphene wool (GW) sampler. The latter two were thermally desorbed, whilst the charcoal sampler was solvent extracted. All three samplers were analysed for trace levels of selected volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) by means of gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The GW sampler outperformed the PDMS and activated charcoal samplers as the GW sampled the most compounds and had a lower variability in VOC and SVOC (selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and n-alkane) concentrations sampled, especially in the case of the n-alkanes (average %RSDs of the GW, PDMS and activated charcoal samplers were found to be 23.8%, 43.1% and 52.9%, respectively). The activated charcoal sampler was found to be unsuitable in this study due to the low number of detected compounds, as well as high benzene and toluene backgrounds of the sorbent. Combustion of diesel was found to emit a total VOC and SVOC concentration 4–5 times that of GTL and RME, respectively, based on GW sampler analyses. This study therefore further supports GTL and RME as cleaner fuel alternatives to petroleum derived diesel. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Eight Anglo-Nubian goats with 42.06 ± 3.5 kg body weight (BW) and 51 ± 4.0 d in milk were randomly assigned in a double 4 × 4 Latin square experiment with 20-d periods and four diets with different concentrations of crude glycerin (0, 70, 140 and 210 g/kg on DM basis) to evaluate the effects on intake and on production, composition, fatty acid (FA) profile and sensory traits of milk. The inclusion of crude glycerin from waste frying oils in the goat diets linearly decreased the intake of DM (P=0.001), NDF (P&lt;0.001) and NFC (P=0.007), goat milk production (P=0.006), 4% fat-corrected milk production, (P=0.007), milk composition of total solids, (P=0.006) fat (P=0.005), protein (P=0.03), lactose (P=0.006), total solids (P=0.005), nonfat solids (P=0.005), saturated FA C14:0 (P&lt;0.001) concentrations, short- (P&lt;0.001) and medium-chain (P=0.002) FA proportions and atherogenicity index of fat milk. There was a quadratic increase of EE intake (P=0.002), fat and lactose (P=0.03) milk composition and linear increases in unsaturated FA (P&lt;0.001), monounsaturated (MUFA; P&lt;0.001), UFA:ΣSFA (P=0.002), MUFA:ΣPUFA (P=0.001), all long-chain FA (P&lt;0.001), Σcis C18:1 (P&lt;0.001), and the activity levels of Δ9desaturase 18 (P=0.008) and elongase (P&lt;0.001) with crude glycerin inclusion in the diets of milk goats. The water intake, milk concentration (g/kg) of CP and SNF, C16:0, C18:0 and C18:2 cis-9, trans-11 FAs, polyunsaturated (PUFA), n-3, n-6, and n-6:n-3 ratio, Trans:C18:0, activity of Δ9desaturase 14 and 16, and sensory attributes (odor and flavor) of milk were not affected by crude glycerin intake (P&gt;0.05). Crude glycerin from waste frying oils (36% glycerol and 26% EE) inclusion up to 210 g/kg in total DM replacing corn ground in diets of lactating goats improves milk solids composition and fatty acid profile, which it is desirable for the industry of dairy products, however, it reduce DMI, production and total solids milk, without effects on sensory attributes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The use of renewable energies to combat climate change is one of the greatest goals for humanity. To achieve this objective, one alternative is to valorize and recycle wastes, i.e. food waste, generated daily due to our way of life. Every day, human beings generate thousands of tons of this organic matter that can be recycled to produce bioenergy. Food waste is a source of carbon that must be included into the carbon dioxide cycle. In this manuscript, we propose to recycle the organic waste produced in a kebab local restaurant through biodiesel production, assisted by clean energy i.e. ultrasound. Biodiesel of both chicken grease and a mixture of beef-lamb were synthesized and optimized by response surface methodology and desirability function. Fatty acid methyl ester yields were higher (97.42% w/w for chicken grease and 96.98 for beef-lamb grease) than the minimum threshold established by European regulation EN 14214 (≥96.5% w/w). Although, cold-filter plugging point and oxidation stability resulted in values far from those established by the EN 14214 standard. To improve them while meeting standard threshold, both antifreeze and antioxidant were added following a design of experiments. The addition of antioxidant t-butyl-hydroxyquinone (TBHQ) at concentrations between 800 and 900 ppm and a commercial antifreeze at concentrations above 0.08% v/v, significantly improved biofuel quality in terms of storage and cold flow properties. We can conclude that animal fat residues from kebab restoration can provide suitable biodiesel if antioxidants and antifreezes are added. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The availability of elastomers that are resistant to biodiesel, petrodiesel, and their blends can provide a great impetus to the enhanced utilization of biofuels. However, due to the inherent differences in the polarity of biodiesel and petrodiesel, it has been realized that finding a single elastomer compatible with both types of fuels and their blends is extremely difficult. This study reports an approach to circumvent such limitations by modifying the elastomer backbone via grafting of a polymer with markedly different polar and dispersive components of the solubility parameter in the Hansen's solubility space from either type of fuel. Ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) (δD, δP, δH = 18.6, 3.4, 4.4 MPa1/2) was chosen as the elastomer matrix, and acrylic acid (AA) (δD, δP, δH = 11.3, 8.1, 5.2 MPa1/2) was chosen as the monomer to be grafted. To enhance the grafting yield of AA, silica percolated EPDM (SiEP) matrix was developed. This approach led to a significant increase in the grafting yield and fuel resistance; furthermore, the tensile strength increased by several fold while maintaining elongation at break of more than 700%. EPDM rapidly disintegrated in petrodiesel, whereas AA grafted silica percolated EPDM (AA-g-SiEP) maintained its integrity. Notably, even in biodiesel and biodiesel/petrodiesel blends, AA-g-SiEP had lower fuel uptake. These results were explained by considering the preferred orientation of the polar group of biodiesel toward AA domains, forming a barrier layer which impedes the further diffusion of fuel molecules. These observations suggest that the development of graft structures with extremely different matrix-graft solubility parameters can be used for designing materials resistant to chemical environments which have a different or mixed solubility profile.

AB  - Due to thegrowing awareness of fossil fuel depletion and environmental issues, biodiesel alternative fuel is currently of substantial interest. This research assessed herbal industry wastes as a potential resource for biodiesel production for the first time. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), obtained in the transesterification reaction, were extracted from the herbal samples by ultrasound-assisted extraction and identified withgas chromatography-mass spectrometry in the selected ion monitoring mode. The presence of at least 20 (e.g., in chamomile and chicory) FAMEs, up to 31 in nettle and senna, was reported. The unsaturated FAMEs were found in higher amounts than saturated. Linoleic acidwas the major polyunsaturated FAME in herbal wastes, while palmitic acid was the major saturated FAME. The highest content of FAMEs was identified in rye bran, Figure tea, and chicory. According to the cetane number prediction, BS EN 14214:2012+A2:2019, and hierarchical clustering on principal components (HCPC)wastes from, e.g., nettle, sage, and senna, are the most suitable in biodiesel production with fuel properties acceptable by the EuropeanStandards.Principal component analysis and HCPC allowed to classify and groupsimilar plants according to their FAMEs content; however, additional studies of herbal biofuel properties are needed. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The world is moving towards renewable energy sources rapidly and, at present, fossil fuels are reducing day by day. In this scenario, biofuels have become an attractive alternative to conventional diesel fuels. In the present work, the vaporization of Thumba biodiesel is numerically modeled using the finite volume-based approach in ANSYS Fluent and the results are compared with diesel fuel. Evaporation of fuels is governed by the conservation equations of energy, momentum, and mass. Owing to high temperature and pressure conditions, turbulence is present in the engine cylinder. To account for the turbulence effects, the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) turbulence model is used. Heat transfer to droplet and mass lost by the droplets is governed by the discrete phase model equations. The obtained results include the droplet lifetime, increase in temperature of a droplet, and velocity profiles. It is observed that the size and temperature of fuel droplets and ambient temperature have a significant effect on the evaporation time of fuel droplets in the engine cylinder. By reducing the droplet size, the complete evaporation of fuels can be achieved. Droplets having a high temperature have a short evaporation time and high evaporation rate. It is noted that, at a higher temperature, biodiesel evaporates more quickly than diesel fuel, thus producing complete combustion and hence giving maximum power output. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The rate of Indonesian oil imports has increased from 1980 to the present, despite fluctuations. The transportation sector is the largest oil consumption above the industrial and household sectors. The availability, price, and environment factors also make a reason to think about cleaner fuels. Therefore, we conducted a review of the experience of implementing alternative fuels. At present, LPG, CNG, ethanol and biodiesel are good candidates to replace conventional fuels for land transportation in Indonesia. For gas-based fuels, LPG is relatively easy to implement because it only requires a slight modification to the engine but it is not suitable for the future because it is a refinery product. CNG provides advantages over LPG. The lower carbon content and high octane number provide better environmental effects and can be applied to machines with a higher compression ratio. For biofuels, ethanol has almost all the main characteristics for cleaner SI engine fuels. Indonesia has abundant biodiversity to produce ethanol. However, large-scale production will conflict with the availability of land for food crop production. Biodiesel has been produced on a large scale in Indonesia. Palm oil, Jatropha curcas, sunflowers and all seeds containing oil can be planted on all islands in Indonesia. One feature of biodiesel is that it can be applied independently or mixed with diesel oil. With improved quality, biodiesel can be applied to diesel engines without engine modification. This makes biodiesel more feasible for diesel engines than ethanol for gasoline engines. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering. All rights reserved.

AB  - Right-of-way (ROW) land areas are required for all publicly owned transportation roadways representing over 40 million acres within the US alone. These relatively unused land assets could support potential farming land for plants and algae that contain high levels of lipids that could be used in the energy industry as an alternative fuel source. This process would offer many benefits including more efficient use of public land, eliminating mowing maintenance, increasing the bioenergy use in the US, providing visually appealing viewscapes, and helping to naturally reduce localized carbon dioxide. This paper analyzed the feasibility and potential optimization strategies of using this concept in the South-Eastern United States by scaling and comparing many of the benefits and risks associated with the selected lipid sources (soybeans, flax, sunflowers, Tung trees, Chinese tallow tree, and microalgae). Based on this assessment, the most attractive option appears to be growing flax in the winter and sunflowers in the summer with Tung Trees grown year-round as an alternative option. This would maximize lipids output while preserving and enhancing right-of-way land areas. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Granular activated carbon (GAC) was applied as an adsorbent for biogas desulfurization. Biogas containing 932–2,350 ppm of H2S was collected from an anaerobic digester to treat the wastewater from a dairy farm with about 200 cows. An adsorption test was performed by introducing the biogas to a column that was packed with approximately 50 L of commercial GAC. The operation ceased if the effluent gas had an H2S concentration of over 100 ppm. The GAC was replaced by a given weight of new GAC in a subsequent test. For H2S concentrations in the range of 932–1560 ppm (average±SD = 1,260 ± 256 ppm), 1 kg of the GAC yielded biogas treatment capacities of 568 ± 112cu m and H2S adsorption capacities of 979 ± 235 g. For the higher influent H2S concentrations of 2,110 ± 219 ppm, the biogas treatment and H2S-adsorption capacities decreased to 229 ± 18 cu m and 668 ± 47 g, respectively. An estimation indicated a requisite cost of US$16.5 for the purification of 1000 cu m of biogas containing 2110 ppm of H2S. This cost is approximately 5% of US$330, the value of 1000 cu m of biogas.

AB  - Mid-Infrared absorption spectroscopy associate with the Partial Least Squares regression is the official method to monitor Brazilian commercial diesel quality. This method, however, uses solvents and a large number of samples for the construction of the calibration curves, which generates waste and increases the time needed for the analysis. In order to develop a non-destructive method, being possible to recover the sample after its quantification, decrease the quantity of samples and make use of a single calibration curve, in this study we used the oilseed crambe, which is not used in human food, for the methyl biodiesel production and PLS analysis for their content determination in mixtures with diesel at a concentration range of 1.00 to 30.00 (% v/v). The global model for crambe methyl biodiesel obatined RMSEC = 0.26 (% v/v), RMSECV = 0.35 (% v/v) and RMSEP = 0.41 (% v/v). Complementary, variable selection method iPLS was applied in the global model in order to reduce the spectral range required to regression construction and to improve the RMSEP, RMSECV and RMSEC values. © 2020 Sociedade Brasileira de Quimica.

AB  - Algal biorefinery process utilizes every component of algal biomass to produce multiple useful fuel products. In this technique, acid pretreatment of algal biomass hydrolyzes microalgal carbohydrates into fermentable sugars, makes lipids more extractable and a protein part accessible for additional products. In the present study, Chlorella sorkiniana produced higher quantity of biodiesel than Botryococcus braunii and biomass in Botryococcus braunii was higher than the Chlorella sorkiniana. Botryococcus braunii produces 11% more lipid content than Chlorella sorkiniana which was consistent with biomass content. The total sugar (oligomeric and monomeric) yield attained by Combined Algal Processing (CAP) was 89.9%. 29 g/L ethanol was produced during the fermentation in the Pretreated Algal Slurry. The recovery of lipids from CAP was reported as 84–89% after fermentation and ethanol removal. CAP preserves the PUFA (Poly-Unsaturated Fatty Acids) and utilizes these high-value PUFAs to further reduce the cost of biofuel production and replace petroleum products. © 2020 University of Tehran.

AB  - Targets to reduce CO2 emissions by 75% and NOx emissions by 90% by 2050 in aviation have been set by The Advisory Council for Aviation Research and Innovation in Europe. Sustainable fuels, e.g., emulsified biofuel, have demonstrated promise in reducing emissions and greenhouse gases. The aim of this project is to investigate the stability of a water in oil emulsion using sunflower oil. The primary objective is to achieve an emulsion which is stable for at least 4 days, and the secondary objective is to investigate how altering the emulsification parameter values of the surfactant hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB), energy density and sonotrode depth in an ultrasonication procedure can impact the stability. The stability of each emulsion was measured over a period of 14 days. The main outcome is that two of the 14 emulsions made remained stable for at least 14 days using a surfactant HLB of five, which proved to be the optimum value from those tested. The results also show that, by using the sonotrode in a higher starting position, emulsions achieved a greater stability. Furthermore, over-processing of the emulsion was determined, with the point of over-processing lying between an energy density of 75 and 200 W.s/mL. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - In this study, waste cooking oil (WCO) was used to successfully manufacture catalyst cracking biodiesel in the laboratory. This study aims to evaluate and compare the influence of waste cooking oil synthetic diesel (WCOSD) with that of commercial diesel (CD) fuel on an engine’s operating characteristics. The second goal of this study is to compare the engine performance and temperature characteristics of cooling water and lubricant oil under various engine operating conditions of a test engine fueled by waste cooking oil and CD. The results indicated that the engine torque of the engine running with WCOSD dropped from 1.9 Nm to 5.4 Nm at all speeds, and its brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) dropped at almost every speed. Thus, the thermal brake efficiency (BTE) of the engine fueled by WCOSD was higher at all engine speeds. Also, the engine torque of the WCOSD-fueled engine was lower than the engine torque of the CD-fueled engine at all engine speeds. The engine’s power dropped sequentially through 0.3 kW, 0.4 kW, 0.6 kW, 0.9 kW, 0.8 kW, 0.9 kW, 1.0 kW and 1.9 kW. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This article presents bio-oil production from Napier grass by using a pyrolysis process. The comparative potential of energy conversion and the cost of production among bio-oil, bio-ethanol, biogas and syngas from gasification by using Napier grass as raw material were also analyzed. The pyrolysis in this study was developed from previous work in order to improve the yield of bio-oils. The circulating fluidized bed reactor (CFBr) was used as the reactor, and a new scrub condenser was applied in order to increase the performance of condensing vapor into bio-oil. This system had the ability to feed Napier grass between 45-75 kg/hr, and it could create a solid-recirculating rate of about 52.36 kg/m2s at 7 m/s of maximum superficial velocity. From the results of the bio-oil production, it has been concluded that the maximum yield of bio-oil production is 44.60 wt% at a feed rate of 60 kg/hr and bed temperature of 480°C. The properties and chemical components of bio-oil were also determined. A comparison of energy conversion from Napier grass to products such as bio-oil, ethanol, biogas and syngas through the gasification process as well as an analysis of cost of production revealed that syngas production through gasification has a greater potential energy conversion and cost of production than other technology, which had an energy conversion efficiency and cost of production of about 72.65% and 0.26 USD/GJ, respectively. However, as compared to liquid fuel, the gas fuel has greater limitations in terms of utilization and transportation. The bio-oil production from pyrolysis in this study had a cold efficiency and cost of production of about 28.24% and 17.98 USD/GJ, which proved a more advantageous trend of cold efficiency and production cost than bio-ethanol production, thus it can support a large energy project to create more energy security. © 2020 Regional Energy Resources Information Center (RERIC), Asian Institute of Technology.

AB  - Dual fuel engines use two fuels i.e. primary and pilot fuel and have many advantages. By using biofuels, which are abundant and environment friendly as the pilot fuel, emissions can be diminished to a great extent with high efficiency. An experiment is conducted on a single cylinder, Direct Injection diesel engine in Dual fuel mode using 90% diesel and 10% mosambi peel pyro oil with varying amounts of oxygen concentration. The results are then compared to the performance parameters of a diesel engine like Brake Thermal Efficiency, Brake Specific Fuel Consumption, HC, CO, NOₓ and Smoke emissions. The experimental results revealed that BTE increased by 5.35%, BSFC decreased to 27.03% and the exhaust emissions HC, CO and Smoke decreased to 14.61%, 47.98% and 17.94% respectively and NOx emissions increased to about 5.63% when compared to that of diesel fuel operation. © TJPRC Pvt.

AB  - Azotobacter vinelandii is an obligate aerobic diazotroph with a verified transient ability to reduce carbon monoxide to ethylene by its vanadium nitrogenase. In this study, we implemented an industrially relevant continuous two-stage stirred-tank system for in vivo biotransformation of a controlled supply of air enriched with 5% carbon monoxide to 302 μg ethylene g-1 glucose consumed. To attain this value, the process required overcoming critical oxygen limitations during cell proliferation while simultaneously avoiding the A. vinelandii respiratory protection mechanism that negatively impacts in vivo nitrogenase activity. Additionally, process conditions allowed the demonstration of carbon monoxide's solubility as a reaction-limiting factor and a competitor with dinitrogen for the vanadium nitrogenase active site, implying that excess intracellular carbon monoxide could lead to a cessation of cell proliferation and ethylene formation as shown genetically using a new strain of A. vinelandii deficient in carbon monoxide dehydrogenase. © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Industrialization and energy demand increase are highlighted as consequences of world population growth for decades. Thereby, aiming to contribute to sustainable processes capable of mitigating the effects resulting from this process, biofuels have been intensively researched, produced and used in recent years. Among the possibilities, dimethyl ether (DME) stands out with great prospects replacing liquefied petroleum gas and diesel due to its potential as clean fuel. This work aims to conjoin the production of DME, a biofuel with great prospects for technical performance, safety, and economy, with a favorable destination for vinasse, the most worrying residue of ethanol production, due to its high polluting potential and large production volume in several countries. A rigorous and robust simulation of direct synthesis of DME from vinasse-derived syngas is performed using Aspen Hysys and its supplements, evaluating the technical and economic aspects of its production in ethanol distilleries. Results of the proposed scenario point that the process is technically feasible, reaching a purity of 99.9%, respecting the minimum required by standard norms. In addition, the designed process achieved yields of 1 kg of DME for each 1.6 kg of syngas. The simulated process presented a total capital cost of 47.1 millions of dollars, operating costs of 14.1 millions of dollars per year, and utilities cost of 11.2 millions of dollars per year. Considering energy cogeneration, an economy of 9.2% was reached, resulting in a production cost of simulated stage of 98.36 US$/tonne of DME and, considering a complete scenario, an accumulated cost of 233.48 US$/tonne of DME. It demonstrates an economic competitiveness for the DME price and ensures a considerable profit margin for the process. Consequently, the investigated DME production scenario emerges as a promising diesel substitute in a realistic scenario.

AB  - The Brazilian Biodiesel Technology Network (RBTB) was created in 2004 to boost technological development in the Brazilian biodiesel chain. Among the participating institutions is the Federal University of Bahia (UFBA), which has been conducting research on biofuels since the 1980s and has been ranked second place in the number of projects related to biodiesel at CNPq and fourth place in the Catalog of Theses and dissertations of Capes. In view of the expressive number of works produced in masters and doctorate courses of UFBA, this article measured the academic performance of biodiesel research at UFBA, based on the analysis of theses and dissertations produced between 2005-2019 and evaluated the productivity of advisor professors through the Lotka’s law. For this purpose, a documentary research was carried out, and bibliometric methods were used to create scientific activity indicators from the 133 prospected records and the generalized inverse power distribution model was applied to measure the productivity of the advisor professors. It was observed that the production of theses and dissertations at UFBA was uninterrupted with 200 orientations carried out by 77 advisor professors; between 2006 to 2019 and that, the observed distribution fits the Lotka Law. However, an analysis of the trend revealed the possibility of a drop in the number of registrations for the coming years, just at the moment when the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovations intends to strengthen the RBTB in order to overcome technological and market bottlenecks that still exist in the biodiesel chain. © 2020 Universidade Federal de Campina Grande.

AB  - Microalgae are recognized as a promising source for biofuel production, which is known as a renewable source of energy. This study was conducted to optimize the biodiesel production quantitatively and qualitatively by the microalga, Nannochloropsis oculata upon culturing on two different culture media (F/2 and Boussiba media) as a comparative study through stress in the main culture compositions by 1) Treating with different salinity concentrations (20, 40 and 60psu), 2) Depleting from phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) sources for the two media. After different treatments, the growth rate, protein, carbohydrate, lipid, and fatty acids contents were determined. The algal analysis cleared that increasing salinity to 60psu in F/2 medium and 40psu on the Boussiba medium led to increasing the number of N. oculata cells with the maximum protein and carbohydrate contents at late exponential phase. At lower salinity, there were no significant differences in total protein content while carbohydrate contents showed slight variations, and its minimum values were obtained at (N) starved medium. Total lipid and total fatty acids content were higher in N. oculata cultured on F/2 medium than on Boussiba medium at different treatments and achieved its maximum when cultured on N-starved > P-depleted > Salt-stressed 60psu, respectively. The highest physical properties of the produced biodiesel represented in the degree of unsaturation (SD), iodine values (IV), Cetane number (CN), and oxidation stability were recorded in N. oculata cultured on higher salinities and Ndepleted conditions in the two media. Using higher salinities up to 40psu (available in the natural seawater), N-depletion or P-depletion in F/2 medium for achieving highly economical results in the production of N. oculata microalga. Biodiesel produced from N. oculata oil can be considered as a potential candidate for commercial sources. © 2020, Egyptian Society for the Development of Fisheries and Human Health.

AB  - Currently, there are several studies using calcium oxide, calcium alkoxide, and calcium hydroxide for biodiesel production. However, there is still a lack of studies highlighting the use of calcium diglyceroxide (calcium oxide enriched with glycerin in the presence of methanol) as a catalyst in the transesterification process. Therefore, the present work aimed to investigate the catalytic efficiency and reutilization of the eggshell calcined and enriched with glycerin and methanol (ECEG), in the synthesis of methylic esters from frying residual oil. As a result, thermochemically modified eggshells showed catalytic efficiency during methylic transesterification of residual oils in mass concentrations of 15%, 5%, 3%, and 1% due to the presence of a high level of esters (97.39, 96.97, 97.75, and 92.96%, respectively). The initial concentration of the enriched eggshell used in methanolysis had a direct effect on the final ester mixture. A 15% increase in the water content of the frying oil contributed to an increase in the ester content. The ECEG was reactive and efficient for four reaction cycles (without reactivation of the catalytic sites) due to the evidence of a high ester content (97.85%, 98.67%, 98.89%, 98.46%), reaching the standard quality of worldwide biodiesel regulations.

AB  - Herein Handal oil extraction from waste biomass is investigated for biodiesel production via esterification and transesterification processes. Furthermore, the physicochemical characteristics of Handal biodiesel (density, kinematic viscosity, specific gravity, pour point, flash point, and cloud point) was performed along with testing the fuel quality used in internal combustion engines. The flash point of the obtained Handal biodiesel (49.5 °C) was lower than that of petroleum diesel (68.3 °C). While at 40 °C, the kinematic viscosity of used Handal oil (4.476 cSt), which was higher than that of diesel fuel (2.6 cSt) and fossil diesel (2.27 cSt). Pourpoint of the used Handal oil was −9 and lower than that of Handal biodiesel, which is +3. The sulfur content of Handal oils was 193 mg/kg, which was higher than the Handal biodiesel value of 62 mg/kg, but significantly lower than that of diesel fuels (≤100 ppm). Similar engine performance regarding thermal efficiency between pure diesel and biodiesel at different engine speeds and loads was detected. The utilisation of such waste stream (Handal wild plant) in the production of biodiesel fuel will aid upcycling an otherwise waste and problematic thermochemical conversion feedstock by adding value for the application in the energy sector. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel (Greek, bio = life + diesel = from Rudolf Diesel) refers to diesel equivalent, processed from biological sources. Biodiesel is otherwise referred as “neat” fuel. It is a fuel derived from a chemical reaction of alcohol (methyl, ethyl, butyl, propyl, isopropyl) and vegetable or animal oils, fats, or greases. These oils or fats are chemically altered in order to use in any diesel engine, with little or no modification. A process called transesterification removes the glycerin component of the oil (which is a triglyceride molecule), resulting in a much thinner, or less viscous product, which stays down to much lower temperatures. It significantly reduces harmful pollutants, as well as carbon dioxide gas and reduces our vehicles contribution to climate change. Current oil and gas reserves are sufficing to last only a few more decades. The scarcity of known petroleum reserves will make renewable energy sources more attractive. To meet the rising energy demand and replace petroleum reserves, fuels, natural gas etc., Biodiesel is in the forefront of alternative technologies. The first record of Biodiesel usage was in 31st August 1937, by the University of Brussels, Belgium who conducted transesterification of vegetable oil using ethanol in order to separate the fatty acids from glycerol by replacing the glycerol with short liner alcohols. More recently Renault and Peugeot have approved the use of biodiesel in some of their own truck engines. In 1991, the European Community (EC) proposed a 90% tax deduction for the use of biofuels, including biodiesel. Now a days each of the plant are producing up to &gt;1.5 billion gallons of fuel per year. The European Union accounted for nearly 89% of all biodiesel production worldwide in 2005.

AB  - In the present investigation, non-edible toxic oils from marine macroalgae Caulerpa racemosa species, richly available in India and composed of high calorific value and high FFA, have been selected as a feedstock for the making of biodiesel. Initially, oil extraction was carried out from the macroalgae biomass with different types of solvent systems and extraction steps. The algal oil was extracted with a solvent system consisting of 1 % diethyl ether and 10 % methylene chloride in n-hexane using ultrasonic pre-treatment technique. The algal oils were characterized by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry for composition analysis. The biodiesel was produced by transesterification method. The produced biodiesel was characterized and the conversion was calculated by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis and Response Surface Methods. The fuel properties of obtained biodiesel were examined as per the American Standard Test Methods specifications in order to assess the potential of proposed biodiesel as an alternative fuel. Thus, marine macroalgae serve as a potential renewable raw-material for biodiesel production. © 2020 National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources (NISCAIR).

AB  - In this work, nine different biodiesels were obtained by transesterification reaction with three types of vegetable oils and three variant alcohols. The objective was to analyze them physicochemically before and after they went to the engine, to know if they had the necessary properties to act as lubricants. Subsequently, the same biodiesels were analyzed in the engine in order to observe the behavior of their dynamic viscosities, to evaluate if they were similar or superior to commercial lubricants. It was possible to note that all biodiesel produced are within the National Agency for Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP) legislation and presented as potential lubricants, due to the kinematic viscosity behavior when compared before and after the engine. These results made them possible replacements for commercial lubricants, besides having greater advantages for the engine and the environment. However, although coconut oil-derived biodiesel has good yields, it is not promising because, at temperatures below 25 °C tends to solidify, causing short, medium- A nd long-term engine parts wear. © 2020 Atlantis Livros Ltda..

AB  - A reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as well as an increase in the share of renewable energy are the main objectives of EU energy policy. In Poland, biofuels play an important role in the structure of obtaining energy from renewable sources. In the case of biofuels obtained from agricultural raw materials, one of the significant components of emissions generated in their full life cycle is emissions from the cultivation stage. The aim of the study is to estimate and recognize the structure of GHG emission from biomass production in selected farms in Poland. For this purpose, the methodology that was recommended by the Polish certification system of sustainable biofuels and bioliquids production, as approved by the European Commission, was used. The calculated emission values vary between 41.5 kg CO2eq/t and 147.2 kg CO2eq/t dry matter. The highest average emissions were obtained for wheat (103.6 kg CO2eq/t), followed by maize (100.5 kg CO2eq/t), triticale (95.4 kg CO2eq/t), and rye (72.5 kg CO2eq/t). The greatest impact on the total GHG emissions from biomass production is caused by field emissions of nitrous oxide and emissions from the production and transport of fertilizers and agrochemicals. Emissions that were generated at the stage of production, storage, and transport of seeds and during the use of fuels in agricultural and forestry machinery have a significantly smaller share in the total GHG emissions from biomass production. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Conventional transesterification of vegetable oil with methanol for biodiesel production leads to the separation of glycerol and relatively low reaction efficiency. Methyl acetate is a more common solvent being less toxic and less soluble in water. In the presence of bases the transesterification of methyl acetate with glycerol can easily proceed at refluxing temperature. RESULTS: A yield of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) of 98.0% can be obtained with oil/methyl acetate/methanol molar ratio of 1:1:8 and 10% dosage of KCl/CaO at 65 °C after reaction for 1 h. Furthermore, results of water resistance experiments indicated that trace water gave a promoting effect on FAME yield. Recycling experiments were conducted for four cycles and a greater than 90% yield of FAME indicated the high stability of KCl/CaO. CONCLUSIONS: Efficient biodiesel production with no glycerol byproduct has been developed using a tri-component (canola oil, methyl acetate and methanol) coupling chemical reaction with calcium oxide-supported chloride as catalyst. Various characterization techniques revealed that the unique catalytic activity of KCl/CaO was related to its high degree of crystallinity, relatively high surface basicity and large pore size. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Antioxidant additives are commonly used to prevent biodiesel oxidation. Most antioxidant studies have focused on the effects of chemosynthetic antioxidants, but there has been limited research on natural antioxidants. In this study, a cheap and readily available natural antioxidant, Pyrola extract, was applied for biodiesel protection. An immersion test that exposes biodiesel to copper chips was used to compare the antioxidant activities between Pyrola extract and the commercial antioxidants, pyrogallol and BHT. Pyrola extract performs much better than pyrogallol (PY) and BHT on all of the quality characteristics of biodiesel, including acid value, iodine value, peroxide value, and corrosion rate of the coppers. Analysis by gas chromatography also indicates that Pyrola extract helps to maintain the original components of the biodiesel. Due to the simple extraction process and low cost raw materials, Pyrola extract may be a potential antioxidant for protecting biodiesel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is a degradable, environment friendly, efficient alternate energy source. It is extracted from several crops such as sugarcane, corn, palm, soybean, rapeseeds etc., but Jatropha carcus is preferred over other crops because of its economic advantage, high yield per hectare, better returns, sustainable development, and easy holding. Further, it is non-edible perennial crop that grows well in arid regions with marginal soil. In Brazil, India, Vietnam, Ghana, Zambia, and Nicaragua the biodiesel producing activity is highly successful, however Pakistan being energy sensitive and having wide-spread arid areas can also be a plausible candidate for jatropha cultivation. Jatropha not only produces oil (approx 0.2 L/kg) to be used as biofuel, it stimulates economic growth, reduces country’s dependence on imports of Petro-diesel, emits negligible pollutants, improves environment, serves as a shield against deforestation/desertification, generates jobs, and provides better livelihood to poor masses in the rural areas. The biodiesel obtained from Jatropha seed is equally efficient to Petro-diesel in performance, and it is being used successfully through blending (10%) with Petro-diesel. Comparsion between Biofuel and Petro-fuel shows that combustion quality (Cetane 51) and the flash point (130 °C) of Biofuel as compared to standard Petro-diesel (Cetane 46–50, flash point 50 °C) are much higher. Hence the production of biofuel (from Jatropha plants) is considered one of the options to overcome the situation of energy deficiency. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The use of biodiesel has increased in the last decade and so has the obtainment of the main by-product from its manufacturing, glycerol; however, the direct use of it has not been possible due to the residual components that are present from the biodiesel production itself and the high-cost purification methods necessary for its reuse. Since this molecule presents a high potential for the development of a large variety of products, it is of great importance that this resource is harnessed. We present the results obtained from the use of a simple pH-based precipitation technique from which we obtained glycerol with 50% wt. purity and its assessment as a germination additive in two varieties of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) obtaining a competitive behavior when compared with a commercial organic fertilizer within the germination and first stage of plant development suggesting a new use as an added value product for the biofuels industry. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The pyrolysis of frying palm oil was studied in continuous stationary process, in a micropilot plant. The main factors affecting the products yields are temperature and residence time. For the studied parameters range (temperature: 475°C-630°C and residence time: 120 s-240 s), the gas yield varied between 7.9% (w/w) and 63.3% (w/w), related to feed. Unsaturated hydrocarbon yields (olefins) can reach 24-29% (w/w) related to feed, at the right processing parameters, the main products having good yields: Up to 10% w/w for ethylene and 10.5% (w/w) for propylene. Also, the liquid fractions produced in the experiment were characterized having in view the use as fuel oils. The low viscosity (4.4-8.3 cSt at 20°C) and high heat of combustion value (9225-9260 kcal/kg) demonstrated that liquids are fit for use as fuel oil. These results are encouraging for industrial applications consideration. For this reason, mathematical modeling for the prediction of products yields was performed. The individual models for the main compounds (ethylene, propylene, methane, ethane, propane, carbon oxides) are in form of second degree polynomial equations; they are accurate as the statistical analysis proved. © 2020 Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, Romania.

AB  - Wet impregnating methods have been developed to produce advanced hydroxyapatite binary SrO-Ag2O3/ HA Catalyst with improved physiochemical properties, modified surface morphology and chemistry. A catalyst (SrO-Ag2O3/ HA) for decarboxylation / decarboxylation was used to turn palm oil into green diesel. FTIR, FESEM, XRD, TGA, BET, TPD-CO2 and TPD-NH3 have all been characteristics of the new catalyst. High catalytic activity depended largely on the hydroxyapatite and binary metallic systems' high and simple density of active sites that led to a greater synergy between the cycle of simultaneous decarbonization and decarboxylation of palm oil. The result showed a maximum range of 96% hydrocarbons and selection n-(C15+C17) of about 80% under optimal condition at 3% of the catalyst at 330°C, 3wt.% within 180min. The catalyst is robust with a high degree of reusability around 6 runs. © 2020 the Author(s). All rights reserved.

AB  - Algae biomass is newly considered to be a higher source of energy. In algae, the energy is stored as oils and carbohydrates, with that have higher productivity. The production can be about 2000 to 5000 gallons of biofuels in one year. Algae have become a dependable source for bio-oil production all through Pyrolysis. The bio-oil be obtained from the process of heating the spirulina algae at the maximum temperature of 200˚C to 350˚C. During the pyrolysis of spirulina algae, the products obtained are char, liquid, and gas. These products are qualified and bio-oil properties were analyzed. The performances of a diesel engine under various injection pressure conditions i.e., 200bar and 220bar were carried out for B10 (SP10D90) and baseline diesel respectively. The consequences showed that at complete loading conditions, the maximum output power obtained while using bio-fuels is nearly the same as diesel. The consumption fuel is more when compared with diesel. The present is enhanced performance and condensed emissions by an injection pressure of 220 bars. The BTE of algae biofuels at 220bar is 28% which is close to Standard diesel along with the emission of CO, HC, and NOX also is less compared to 200 bars and standard diesel. © TJPRC Pvt. Ltd.

AB  - A conceptual biodiesel production homogeneous process was developed, considering the typical reaction conditions, appropriate thermodynamic models as well as the kinetics of a representative reaction for vegetable oils, under assumption to be mass-produced and provide a continuous way the raw material for the production of the biofuel. Reasonable assumptions and the use of a rigorous simulator of processes were employed; the process was simulated for the treatment of 1000 mol/h of oil operating continuously, at 45 and 55 °C, 1.0 wt% catalyst and 6 mol methanol by mol of oil. The processes of catalyst preparation, raw material pumping, heating, isothermal reaction, separation of byproducts by density and distillation were considered, and also auxiliary services of heating and cooling during the process. The convergence of each device was achieved by properly choosing the specifications of the unit operation models. Material and energy balances were obtained at each point in the process and in a global manner. For space-time of 30 min in single and series reactors global efficiencies from ~ 80 to 85% biodiesel was calculated for all explored alternatives. The ratio of energy production of biodiesel to the energy consumed by the process, within the battery limits used in this study, was found to be more than 6 times, thus ensuring the sustainability of the process from energetic point of view. It was found that, for the highest purity and better ratio of energy produced/consumed, the global efficiency process was the lowest. © 2020, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - A one-step direct alkylation method for synthesizing butyl levulinate from butyl alcohol and furfuryl alcohol has been explored. This process is carried out under reflux, at ~ 120 °C for 2 h and utilizes a catalyst. Catalysts are based on phosphotungstic acid; the catalysts are modified via cation exchange, producing several cesium, copper and silver based phosphotungstates. Of these, the greatest activity and selectivity towards butyl levulinate was achieved over the Cu0.5H2[PW12O40] catalyst, with 100% conversion and a butyl levulinate selectivity of 69%. Various side reactions are also observed, with products that may also be suitable for biofuel applications. A detailed product analysis has been performed, and likely reaction schemes for these products have been determined. Overall, these results demonstrate an efficient method for butyl levulinate production from biomass-derived sources. © 2019, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - Biomass, the feedstock for biocrude and ultimately renewable diesel is a low energy density feedstock. The transport of this feedstock over long distance has been proven to be a major burden on the commercialisation of biorefining. Therefore, it has been generally accepted that biomass should be upgraded to biocrude (a relatively high energy density liquid) in close proximity to the biomass sources. The biocrude liquid would then be transported to a biorefinery. Biocrude contains large amounts of oxygen (generally up to 38 wt%) that is removed from the crude in the refining process. In this study, we have synthesised a range of spinel oxide based catalysts to remove oxygen from the biocrude during the catalytic fast pyrolysis. The activity of spinel oxide (MgB2O4 where B = Fe, Al, Cr, Ga, La, Y, In) catalysts were screened for the pyrolysis reaction. While all the tested spinel oxides deoxygenated the pyrolysis vapour, MgCr2O4 was found to be effective in terms of oxygen removal efficiency relative to the quantity of bio oil produced. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Emissions from use of fossil fuels have consistently posed significant threat to the environment and wellbeing of man. This has prompted several studies aimed at finding solution to the emissions and their effects. The aim of this research is to investigate the effect of adding pentanol and biodiesel from Moringa Oleifera seed to pure diesel content of 70% by volume. pentanol and biodiesel make up the remaining 30 percent by volume and were also varied, with pentanol percentage being increased from 2 percent to 8 percent so as to carefully monitored the effects of adding pentanol while the Moringa oleifera biodiesel made up the balance for the 30%. These blends were labelled according to the percentage composition of biodiesel and pentanol (B28P2, B26P4, B24P6, B24P6, and B22P8). The physicochemical properties of all blends such as viscosity, density, pour point, acid value and iodine value determined. From the result of the engine performance and emission tests, B24P6 blend has been noted to have the best engine performance parameters, haven shown the best engine brake power of 19.787 kW, and with the highest engine brake thermal efficiency of 19.78%.While in term of engine emission, B22P8 blend, have the lowest Nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission, with a value of 82.4994 ppm which is about 3% lower than that of pure diesel, while B26P4 have the lowest carbon monoxide (CO) emission among all the samples tested with value of 6.1556 ppm which is about 58% lower than that of Petro diesel. However, blends appeared to have good brake mean effective pressure except for B22P8 which have the lowest BMEP, that’s about 2.8% lower than that of Petro diesels. Conclusively, the addition of Moringa oleifera biodiesel with pentanol improved the diesel quality, yielding good improvement in engine performance and emission. © 2020, University of Ilorin, Faculty of Engineering and Technology.

AB  - Biodiesel is a biomass-based fuel. Biodiesel faces the difficult issue of storage stability. The storage stability of a biodiesel can be enhanced by adding an antioxidant to the fuel, which represses oxidation reactions that take place upon exposure to sunlight, heat, moisture, humidity, and metal. In the present study, biodiesel is synthesized from pomelo oil (Citrus maxima) and treated with a synthetic antioxidant called TBHQ (Tertiary butyl hydroquinone). The engine and emission performance of the biodiesel with TBHQ in various concentrations have been determined in a single cylinder four stroke diesel engine. It is observed that brake specific fuel consumption increases with the increasing concentration of TBHQ. Brake power stays unaltered for the biodiesel with or without TBHQ. Considerable reduction in carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide has been observed for biodiesel irrespective of antioxidant treatment. © 2021

AB  - Nowadays, biodiesel has been receiving attention as the most promising renewable and environmentally friendly alternative biofuel to diesel fuel. It has many advantages including oxygen content in the molecular structure and higher cetane number. On the other hand, the main lacks of biodiesel are the high viscosity (causing poor atomization and a decrease in engine performance), and high production cost. To handle both shortcomings, the combined influences of transesterification parameters (potassium methoxide amount, reaction temperature, methyl alcohol/oil molar ratio, and reaction time) on viscosities of biodiesels were experimentally examined as a full matrix experimental design. The transesterification parameters, which provided the possible minimum viscosity, were researched using the cubic spline interpolation method. According to results, the minimum biodiesel viscosity of 3.545 mm2/s was reached at the optimal reaction parameters (catalyst amount of 1.00%, methyl alcohol/oil molar ratio of 8: 1, reaction temperature of 55°C and reaction time of 53 min). The fuel characteristics of the final waste cooking oil biodiesel (WCOB) produced under optimal parameters were also determined to be within limits in EN 14214 standard. © 2020 SAE International.

AB  - This paper focuses on the performance and emission analysis of variable CI engine having biodiesel as alternate working fluid produced from a novel process. Biodiesel prepared from two types of vegetable oils (soybean B15, B20, and Karanja B10) in a novel transesterification process, which involves the single-step production of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) has been used. This method of fuel production is less time consuming and cost-effective. Brake power, brake mean effective pressure, brake thermal efficiency, and specific fuel consumption are measured under variable load conditions which show almost similar performance trends of various mechanical parameters for the biodiesel as of common diesel fuel. Emission analysis has also been carried out, which shows that there have been decreasing trends of CO and increasing trends in CO2 and NOX percentage in case of increasing load. A new correlation for thermal efficiency concerning influencing parameters has been developed as well. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - The twin crisis of environmental degradation and fossil fuel depletion has confronted the world with the upcoming threat to seek the solution for some alternate fuel. The present condition of environment forces the search of some suitable alternate fuel. The present degradation of environment is also mainly influenced by the diesel vehicles. The emissions released by these diesel vehicles not only degrade the environment but also increase the number of health diseases. The present research on bio-fuels will lead to develop a sustainable solution to this problem and also create a harmonic relationship between the economy and ecosystem. The present research will provide the optimized blending ratio compression ratio and other operating parameters to be selected while approaching to sustainable output. The present study will depict the behavior of different bio-fuels poured in VCR engine at different compression ratio at different operating parameters. The outcomes of this research paper reveals the discussion on the potential assessment of different biofuels in the reduction of engine emissions. © 2019 Scientific Publishers. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study aimed to investigate and compare the effects of waste plastic oil/ethanol blends focusing on physical-chemical properties of the fuel and performance, combustion characteristics, and emissions of a diesel engine. Waste plastic oil produced by the pyrolysis process was mixed with ethanol. Experiments were conducted on WE10 (10% ethanol and 90% waste plastic oil, v/v) at four engine loads and a constant engine speed of 2,500 rpm. The experimental results showed that the blended fuel possessed higher cetane index, lower viscosity, density, flash point, and heating value when compared with diesel fuel. The engine test revealed that the use of WE10 led to an increase in indicated specific fuel consumption and a reduction in indicated thermal efficiency. The addition of ethanol to waste plastic oil led to increase in peak of heat release rate in consequence of the retarded start of combustion. The WE10 tended to increase NOX, CO, and HC with respect to diesel fuel. However, lower NOX was found for the combustion of WE10 when compared with WPO. © 2020,Suranaree Journal of Science and Technology All Rights Recerved.

AB  - The emission of gases from the fleet of vehicles is one of the main sources of the environmental impact of the planet. Reversing this scenario, environmental awareness and a search for alternative sources of energy has been growing exponentially in recent years. In this context, the production of biofuels presents itself as an alternative for the lowest environmental impact, energy, and economy, with emphasis on biodiesel. The scale of production of this biofuel, the options related to the raw materials and their conditions are intertwined with the energy and exergetic efficiencies of the process. Therefore, no work was constructed as an analysis of the biodiesel production processes of soybeans and babassu, in which they were conducted on a laboratory scale. According to the results, the production of soybean biodiesel arose in exergetic efficiency of 73.25% and the production of biodiesel from babassu of 74.72%. © 2020, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro.

AB  - Biodiesel and vegetable oil suffer from higher viscosity and boiling point resulting in poor atomization and evaporation rate compared to diesel fuel additional to the lower heating value which negatively affect the stability of flame. The unsteady heat release rate from flame provides unique pressure wave signature that can be captured as acoustic wave. A pressurized combustion chamber was developed and connected to a vehicular turbocharger to test combustion stability and emissions of wide range of liquid biofuels. Biodiesel and blends of palm oil/diesel from 10% (Vol.%) up to 100% pure palm oil (i.e. P10-P100) were investigated and compared to diesel as the benchmark fuel. Microphone probes at the chamber inlet and outlet were used to capture the acoustic signals to be analyzed through the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) using MATLAB program. The analysis of the acoustic signals revealed distinguishable deviation patterns between diesel and other biofuels which showed close resemblance to the carbon monoxide (CO) emission patterns at the same operating pressures. Biodiesel was comparable to P20, while increasing palm oil blend resulted in higher deviation. Chamber pressure also showed positive effect on combustion stability and reduced the deviation between diesel and other biofuels. © 2020 PENERBIT AKADEMIA BARU. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - In this work agricultural waste-based coconut biomass and compressed agricultural waste derived from brown briquette were used for generation of gas in a downdraft gasifier. Its subsequent combustion takes place in a modified diesel engine using rice bran oil (RiOME) biodiesel injected in bi-fuel mode. For the injected pilot fuel, producer gas operation with coconut biomass derived fuel has improved liquid fuel saving. Downdraft gasifier was integrated with four stroke DI water cooled 5.2 kW CI engine at 1500 rpm speed. Experimentation results showed that for the gasifier-engine system coconut biomass derived gas with diesel based dual fuel operation results in 9.05% higher BTE. RiOME-producer gas (CNS) operation showed 16.1% decrease in EGT and 12.1% reduction in NOx emission compared to diesel based dual fuel operation. NOx emissions for the RiOME based engine operation were found to be lower than the diesel based operation. However, the smoke, HC and CO emissions were higher. Diesel fuel saving about 56% was achieved by diesel and producer gas (CNS) dual fuel operation and 100% biofuel utilization in RiOME-producer gas bi-fuel mode of operation was achieved. Further, heat release rates and cylinder pressure for RiOME producer gas (CNS) was marginally lesser than diesel operation. © 2020. MechAero Foundation for Technical Research & Education Excellence.

AB  - Palm oil had been used as fuel in Malaysia with the implementation of petroleum diesel and Palm Methyl Ester (PME) blend at 5% in 2014 and going to 20% blend in 2020. The high cost of the feedstock and the process to convert Free Fatty Acid (FFA) to PME is the major drawback of PME. Alternate feedstock for palm-based biofuel is palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) obtained from a by-product of crude palm oil (CPO) refining. The present study aims to critically analyze the characteristic of biofuel properties which produced using the blend of PFAD and diesel without any chemical reaction. Five blends of PFAD and diesel blends with 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 25% produced in this study. The blending was done using magnetic stirrer and mix continuously for 30 minutes at elevated temperature, 60 °C. The properties of the blends such as density, viscosity, surface tension, pour point and calorific value were determined experimentally. The properties of the blends increase proportionately when PFAD content increases except for calorific value. The calorific value showed a reduction of 3% compared to diesel fuel at 25% blend while the rest showed an insignificant reduction. © 2020 PENERBIT AKADEMIA BARU - All rights reserved.

AB  - Energy plays a key role in each sector of life ranging from basic needs to better standards of life. The world is concerned about 3 ps (population, poverty, and pollution). The increase of these three factors has led the search of the best alternative sources of energies to fulfill all needs of a modern way of life. Biodiesel is a sustainable energy source that has proved to be the best alternate of mineral diesel that possesses similar properties as found in mineral diesel. The recent trend in biodiesel research is towards the use of very cheap feedstock to make this substitute more economical. Following this similar trend, the attempt is made to produce biodiesel from less expensive feedstock namely; residual oil of spent bleaching clay (SBC). In the first step, the quantity of the residual oil that can be recovered followed by assessing its quality was investigated. Afterward, a two-step method of the transesterification process was employed to enhance the yield of methyl ester. The highest yield of 85% was obtained. Key fuel properties were measured and found in good agreement with ASTMD 6751 standards limits. The study also concerned with the practical availability of biodiesel in terms of its stability. For this purpose, produced biodiesel was evaluated for its oxidation stability during 90 days of storage by FT-IR and rancimat methods. © 2020, Japan Oil Chemists Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - The threat of depletion of fossil fuels, extensively used in transport sector, is promoting the research in the field of alternative fuels. Biofuels possess properties close to that of diesel, but being viscous, used as blend with diesel in compression ignition (CI) engines. The current work explores the mixing of two biofuels, karanja oil and rice bran oil, in diesel (designated as RK20) and to observe the performance of CI engine. The blend was made by mixing the oils in the proportion of 10:10:80 (karanja oil, rice bran oil and neat diesel (ND), respectively). The test rig used to conduct the investigation was a double-cylinder, turbocharged and water-cooled direct injection CI engine having constant speed of 1800 rpm and fixed compression ratio of 18.5:1. The injection parameters were varied to optimize the performance parameters of CI engine for the prepared blend of biofuel. The optimized output parameters were brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and brake power (BP) of the CI engine. The ranges of injection timing (IT) and injection pressure (IP) were 15∘–28 ∘btdc and 230–300 bar, respectively. Central composite design technique of response surface methodology was used for design of experiments. The results include the lowest BSFC at low IP and IT for both ND and RK20 blend, also comparable with each other. Maximum BP and minimum BSFC were predicted at 15 ∘btdc and 230 bar IT and IP respectively for both RK20 blend and ND. © 2020, The Institution of Engineers (India).

AB  - Biodiesel is produced from the refined/edible type oils using methanol and an alkaline catalyst which is one of the environmentally friendly alternative liquid biofuels that has proven itself commercially, with international standards all around the world. In present investigation, mixture of two biodiesels in equal weight ratio namely Cucurbita pepo.L (pumpkin) and Tectona grandis (teak) seed oil was used for the synthesis of biodiesel with 5-ml Diethyl ether as additive. Performance test was made with the biodiesel blend using water-cooled, constant speed, CI engine, and emission characteristics were analyzed using a five-gas analyzer. It was observed that there was 35.5% increment in Brake Thermal efficiency and 25.8% reduction in Brake Specific Fuel consumption at maximum load for 200-ml pumpkin and teak biodiesel blend mixed to the diesel with additive. For this blend, it was observed at maximum load, the emission of Carbon monoxide reduced by 26.67% of diesel; Carbon di-oxide reduced by 12.96% and Nitrous oxide reduced by 26.57%. The emission gets increased in over load condition. Unburned Hydro Carbon emission and smoke opacity increased by 67.16 and 9.84%. The combustion characteristics of blended biodiesel with additive closely followed the diesel fuel operation. Hence, this blend was used as fuel in CI engine without engine modification. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Many biofuels extracted from the trees can be directly used as a fuel without any major treatment processes. Among these biofuels the pine and eucalyptus oil have low viscosity and other properties similar to fossil diesel. In the present experimental study the feasibility of using the combination of both the fuels as a blend in diesel is investigated. The viscosity, boiling point and flash point of both the pine and eucalyptus oil were observed to be lower than conventional diesel. Also, the calorific values of these oil biofuels are comparable to diesel. In the present study, various blends of pine and eucalyptus oil viz., P10E10D80, P15E15D70, P5E5D90, P50E50, P20D80, and E20D80 blends were tested in a single-cylinder, four-stroke, direct injection diesel engine for the combustion, emissions and performance characteristics. The results show that at full load condition, the blend of P10E10D80 oil reduces EGT (exhaust gas temperature), HC (hydrocarbon). CO (carbon monoxide) and smoke emissions by 17%, 14.7%, 13%, 20.14%, respectively. The brake thermal efficiency and maximum heat release rate increase by 5.2% and 13%, respectively. However, the NOx (oxides of nitrogen) emission is higher 8.79% than that of diesel fuel at full load condition. The experimental work reveals that the blend of P10E10D80 possesses significantly improved fuel characteristics and can be directly used in diesel engine.

AB  - Once set the mitigation of greenhouse gases in the National Policy on Climate Change (NPCC) with the National Program for Production and Use of Biodiesel (NPPB) in Brazil, this paper aims to estimate the need for biodiesel blended with petroleum diesel to 2020, taking into account the expansion limits of diesel. To estimate the future demand for diesel and CO2 emissions, the Box-Jenkins methodology and top-down were used respectively. The results show that the mixture in Brazil is expected to reach between B31 (31% of blend) and B67 (67% of blend) in 2020, to meet the objectives of the NPCC. © 2020 Ascociacion Internacional de Economia Aplicada.

AB  - The depletion of conventional energy sources and environmental pollution related to use of these energy sources make biodiesel as a renewable replacement to diesel. The biodiesel can be used as an immediate replacement to fossil diesel as its properties are comparable to diesel. The main drawback of the biodiesel is its lower oxidation stability and prone to microbial growth which degrades the properties of biodiesel during storage. However, these problems can be overcome by adding suitable additives to the biodiesel. The non-edible neem oil is one of the feedstocks used for biodiesel in India. The neem biodiesel has lower oxidation stability and hence it is necessary to add suitable additive. The eucalyptus oil has better antioxidant and microbial inhibition properties and hence it was used as an additive in this work. The effect of adding this additive on the biodiesel properties, engine emissions and performance were studied. The engine tests were conducted on a compression ignition engine at different loads with various concentration of eucalyptus oil. The engine performance indicates that the thermal efficiency of the engine with biodiesel is lower than the diesel fuel while the engine exhaust emissions like HC, CO and smoke were lower with the biodiesel. The use of eucalyptus oil as an additive to the biodiesel at full load increases the engine thermal efficiency by 3.08%. Also, it lowers the engine exhaust emissions except NOx emission. © 2020

AB  - In this work, post fuel injection strategy was introduce to mitigate the emission from a common-rail diesel engine with mahua biofuel blend (B25) have been discussed. Post fuel injection strategy has been achieved by common rail direct injection (CRDI) system fitted with conventional single cylinder Kirloskar made TV-I diesel engine. The central composite face cantered (CCFC) design with two factors was utilized in this work to analyse and optimize on post injection process variables in CRDI diesel engine. The consequence of post injection process variables such as post injection quantity (5-30%) and post injection fuel dwell time (5-30ºcrank angle after uncontrolled combustion phase) is studied. The uncontrolled combustion phase ended at 12.21° of crank angle after top dead centre (ATDC). The outcome of post fuel strategy on emissions of a CRDI diesel engine is examined. By retarding the timing and varying the quantity of post fuel injection decreases the engine emissions. Post fuel injection at retarded injection angles provides to decrease the HC, CO and NOx while suppressing the fuel consumption. These results caused by the less quantity of adhering fuel to the engine cylinder wall during combustion. © 2020 World Research Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the view of fossil fuel degradation and environmental aspects, biofuels always remain focused in the research field. In the present research work, the investigation was done on waste cooking oil because of its sustainability, low cost, and waste management. Here, the transesterification process of the waste cooking oil was optimized according to the central composite design of response surface methodology concerning the reaction temperature, catalyst amount, reaction time, and molar ratio (methanol to oil) at five levels. In the Analysis of Variance model, the R2 value is found to be 83% which shows the model is significant and adequate. The 92% maximum methyl ester yield was obtained at the reaction temperature 60°C, catalyst amount 0.75 weight %, time 80 min, and methanol to oil molar ratio 5:1. Also, the economic assessment showed the net cost of waste cooking oil-based biodiesel estimated 32.99 INR per liter. The result could serve as an essential data for upscaling and/or the future investigations in the usefulness of the waste cooking oil as a source of biodiesel. The biodiesel characteristics such as acid value, free fatty acid, kinematic viscosity, saponification value, calorific value, flash point, and cloud point were determined.

AB  - The EU is committed to increasing the use of renewable energy sources. In the sector of transportation, the share of renewable energy is to reach 10% by 2020 and 14% by 2030, respectively, in the EU. According to the latest forecasts, the production of the first-generation biofuels made from food raw materials is showing a declining ten-dency in the main European producing countries. Therefore, the objective of our research is to forecast the production of some selected biofuel producing countries within the EU as well as the traditional biofuel production in Hungary. The question of land use changes due to the new regulations is crucial. Our examinations were carried out by using Verhulst’s logistic function based on the biofuel production data of EUROSTAT. The function has already reached the saturation level in Germany, France and Sweden but in the case of other examined countries, biofuel production is also in the phase of slowing growth. Furthermore, findings are also justified by the 2015 regulation that restricts the share of producing first-generation biofuels in the final energy consumption to 7% and promotes the production of advanced biofuels, thereby decreasing the indirect change in land use and increasing sustainable crop production. © 2020, Czech Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

AB  - The present study envisages the use of diesel blended with plant based oils in conventional engine and their evaluation for engine performance and other emission parameters. Here, individual Pine (P20D80) and Eucalyptus oil (E20D80), and their same (1:1) proportion where ratio mixed (P10E10D80) as a 20% blend with the diesel was used. The selection of mentioned oils was made on the basis of their low viscosity and similarities to fossil diesel. The results revealed that when the engine was operated with P10E10D80, the brake thermal efficiency (5.5%) and lower fuel energy consumption was improved as compared to other blended fuels at full load. Also, the physicochemical characteristics such as viscosity, boiling point lower and calorific value of P10E10D80 were found to be comparable with conventional diesel. The cetane index of P10E10D80 was observed to be lower than E20D80 and conventional diesel, but higher than P20D80. The results revealed that P10E10D80 blend provide a maximum heat release rate of 71.94 J/CA at in-cylinder pressure of 79.63 bar and the ignition delay of the P10E10D80 blend was lower. Moreover, the EGT, HC, and CO smoke opacity emission of the P10E10D80 blend was lower as compared to diesel at full load. Interestingly, the atomization and evaporation rates of P10E10D80 were superior to other blends as well as conventional diesel. The results demonstrated reduction of 15.82%, 23%, 48%, and 26.79% in EGT, HC, CO, and smoke opacity, respectively, with the use of plant based oil blend with diesel. However, NOX emission was increased by 8.60% and observed a 13.50% higher heat release rate compare with blend and conventional diesel at full load. Moreover, an attempt to correlate the constituents of the oils with their performance has also been made. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The biodiesel is the most promising fuel for IC engines as they have the higher calorific value and lower emission quantities. The use of biodiesel in the existing and new engines will increase the performance and reliability of the engine. Once the biodiesel is synthesised and produced in a bulk, it will minimize the cost of biodiesel and it will be lesser than the cost of regular diesel. The use of biofuel with diesel will be prominent as they can produce good performance when combined. In this research work, biodiesel from cotton seed is extracted and transestrified into usable and combustible fuel (COME). To test and improve performance of the COME it has been combined with the diesel in different proportions and prepared as biodiesel (COME-Diesel blends). The blends are tested and compared for various properties to identify the combustion characteristics. The blends are used and tested on the VCR engine to determine the performance and emission characteristics. To develop an empirical model for the emission characteristics, response surface methodology (RSM) design matrix is developed such that the blend, compression ratio, load and speed are the variables and NO and HC are the response functions. The RSM design matrix is experimented and to determine the empirical models, results are verified through the experimental results. © 2020.

AB  - Biodiesel is a renewable fuel that can be made from transesterification of plant oils, waste greases, animal fats, or microalgal oils with methanol. During long-term storage, autoxidation can adversely affect the viscosity and ignition quality of biodiesel. The objective of this work was to investigate the kinetics of oxidation of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) made from canola, palm, and soybean oils (CaME, PME, and SME) plus methyl oleate and stearate (MeC18:1 and MeC18:2). The FAME were analyzed by non-isothermal pressurized-differential scanning calorimetry (PDSC) in dynamic mode (positive airflow) at heating scan rates (β) of 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20 °C min-1. Results were analyzed to infer oxidation rate constants (kT). First order and two autocatalytic kinetic models were applied to calculate isothermal oxidation induction times (Δt) for each FAME. While Δt values varied between the models, ranking the FAME in descending order of Δt was the same for each model regardless of temperature. In contrast, ranking the FAME by the oxidation induction period (IPR) obtained from a Rancimat instrument depended greatly on temperature. Shelf-life data for each FAME were calculated by extrapolating IPR measured at high temperatures to 25°C (SL1). Ranking the FAME by SL1 yielded trends that were unpredictable based on the IPR data. On the other hand, Δt values calculated at 25°C (SL2) from the PDSC results were more consistent. These findings suggest that estimating the shelf-life of biodiesel from dynamic mode non-isothermal PDSC data yielded more reliable results than extrapolation of IPR data measured at high temperatures. © 2020 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers

AB  - The increasing demand for transportation fuels, es-pecially middle distillates, stimulates the research of new strategies to obtain or synthesize biofuels. The processing of lignocellulosic biomass (for example straw) is a process of great interest, because after its hydrolysis and sub-sequent dehydration of the resulting sugar monomers, very valuable substances including furfural are obtained. Then, furfural is selectively hydrogenated to 2-methylfu-ran, sylvan, that is the basic “building block” in the Sylvan process. This manuscript summarizes the knowledge on Sylvan process as a promising way of biofuels synthe-sis. By sylvan condensing with aldehydes, ketones or even 2-methylfuran itself, it is possible to prepare C13-C16 oxygenates in high yields up to 100 % under mild reaction conditions (30-60 °C) over various heterogeneous catalysts. Based on the overview, the heterogeneous catalysts are preferred and the immobilized sulfonic acids are the most active catalysts, however, expensive. The reaction products then may be hydrodeoxygenated commonly over supported noble metal catalysts to provide premium quality C13-C16 hydrocarbons to produce diesel or kerosene. These fractions have great low-tempera-ture properties such as CFPP (-50 °C) or cetane number (70-72). According to the proposed sustainability predic-tion, this process could be sustainable in the Czech Re-public, where 30 % of produced wheat straw could be used for the production of 130 kt advanced biofuels by Sylvan process required by EU directive RED II. Finally, the future approaches have been suggested. © 2020, University of Chemistry and Technology, Faculty of Environmental Technology. All rights reserved.

The advent of nanotechnology improved the performance of the biofuels while including the nanoparticles in it. Hence, the research focussing on the performance improvement and emission reduction of engine using biofules blended with nanoparticles is a noteworthy. In the present work, an investigation was performed on Common Rail Direct Injection (CRDI) engine equipped with Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) setup to analyze the engine performance, combustion and emission characteristics at variable injection pressures by using rice bran biodiesel blended with ceria (CeO2) and zirconia (ZrO2) nanoparticles. Experimental work was done using fuel samples of pure diesel (D100), biodiesel (B30), biodiesel with 15% EGR (B30 + 15%EGR), biodiesel blended with 50 ppm ceria nanoparticles with 15% EGR (B30 + 50CeO2 + 15% EGR), biodiesel blended with 50 ppm zirconia nanoparticles with 15% EGR (B30 + 50ZrO2 + 15%EGR) and biodiesel blended with 50 ppm of ceria and zirconia nanoparticles with 15% EGR (B30 + 25ZrO2 + 25CeO2 + 15%EGR) under various load conditions and injection pressures. Based on the experimental work, the B30 + 25ZrO2 + 25CeO2 + 15%EGR fuel sample displayed better performance compared to other samples. The results showed that the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) of B30 + 25ZrO2 + 25CeO2 + 15%EGR fuel sample was increased by 8% and the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) was reduced by 9% compared to D100. The combustion characteristics showed that the heat release rate and cylinder pressure were increased by 4.3% and 2.8% respectively. Further, the sample B30 + 25ZrO2 + 25CeO2 + 15%EGR decreased the exhaust emission of CO, HC, and NOx by 30%, 19%, and 13.3% respectively. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Biomass conversion into either electricity or biofuels requires various energy intensive processes that may drastically affect its technical and environmental competitiveness against their non-renewable counterparts. Therefore, in this paper, a comparative assessment between the total (cT ) and non-renewable (cNR) unit exergy costs and specific CO2 emissions (cCO2) of the electricity, methane and hydrogen produced from sugarcane vinasse and bagasse is presented and compared with the conventional (fossil fuel-based) supply chains. As a result, the non-renewable unit exergy costs and specific CO2 emissions for the transportation service in all cases analysed are 3.1 to 4.7 times lower compared with conventional fossil fuels (e.g., diesel, gasoline, natural gas and hydrogen). Among the waste upgrade alternatives, methane production is able to maximise the exergy flow rate of products in the transformation stage (52.4-58.6 MW), while hydrogen and electricity production can substantially increase the transportation service in the end-use stage (51.7-52.1%) and the operational revenues (2,706-2,889 EUR/h).

AB  - The increasing pollution problems caused by conventional fuels and fuel scarcity are forcing the scientists all over the world to look for sustainable fuel alternatives. The suitability of hemp biodiesel derived from non-edible industrial grade hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) seed as a biofuel in C.I engines is discussed in this paper. The performance, emission and combustion attributes of different hemp biodiesel combinations are tested on a Kirloskar VCR engine at a standard compression ratio 17.5:1 and the outcomes are contrasted with those of standard diesel fuel. Hemp biodiesel blends exhibit an average increment of 7.35% in the mechanical efficiency in comparison to neat diesel. Hemp biofuel blends also results in a moderate decrement in CO and HC emissions by 20.83% and 24.5% accordingly at peak load. The experimental findings show the suitability of hemp biodiesel blends as a nature-friendly alternate fuel. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Green diesel or known as the hydrocarbons (alkane and alkene) is a renewable and globally friendly biofuel which generally was derived from the triglycerides or fatty acids. The sustainability of the green diesel always concerned the cost of the production, energy supply and demand (net energy balance), the sustainability of more significant crops production or feedstock supply, acceptance of the country and economic stability. Above all, the lack of the petroleum products, the increase in fuel efficiency and affordable by the public are significant reasons for the green diesel to become one of the most important energy supplies for our future The review found important research areas to be reduction in cost of production and maintenance, improvement in fuel quality and improvement in the environmental benefit from using green diesel. With regard to cost reduction, experiments have been conducted on use of low cost catalysts, waste products as feedstocks and H2-free reaction atmosphere. Fuel quality improvement studies have proposed new catalysts, reaction pathways and conditions to improve hydrocarbon selectivity and fuel stability. Future studies must specifically focus on commercial feasibility of the use of waste materials as feedstocks, heterogeneous catalysts, improvement in reaction pathways to production green diesel and similar other concerns. This article covers the catalysis for deoxygenation, the factor influencing the deoxygenation process and the recent progress of deoxygenation. © 2020 PENERBIT AKADEMIA BARU.

AB  - In this work, some physical properties of several biofuels, which are used in compression ignition engines, of which no reference publications have been found, are experimentally obtained. These properties are essential when simulating engine processes such as injection and fuel spray. The measured properties are density and surface tension. Density is measured by the use of a pycnometer and surface tension by means of commercial equipment (Krüss-EasyDyne). Diesel fuel, biodiesel, as well as biodiesel-ethanol blends are tested. Density and surface tension are quantified, verifying that the density is proportional to the concentration of each fuel in the blend. Nevertheless, this is not the case of the surface tension, which fits a second-order polynomial. © European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

AB  - Every 1 kg of palm oil fruit produces an empty fruit bunch (EFB) weighing approximately 0.25 kg. The EFB is considered as the agricultural waste of the palm oil industry due to the excessive amounts produced. The majority of EFB is not appropriately utilized and produces a high level of CO2 as a result of abandonment to landfills. This study investigates the utilization of conventional fast pyrolysis (CFP) to make the biofuel products from EFB waste. Additionally, microwaveassisted pyrolysis (MAP), a new high-performance technique, is also investigated. The calculation of mass and energy balance is conducted using commercial simulation software. The benefits of this plant are investigated in terms of economics and climate change. The results show that neither CFP nor MAP benefits the economy of developing the power plants since they are not profitable. The net present value (NPV) of CFP and MAP are-1,127,674 and-1,073,772 USD, respectively. However, from the climate change aspects, both power plants provide good environmental impact performance. The CO2 emissions resulting from the non-managed disposal of EFB for the CFP and MAP plants were 924, 917, 895 tCO2/yr., respectively. Although the development of these plants might not be beneficial from an economic perspective, they contribute significantly to the reduction of CO2 emissions compared with direct disposal through landfills. This work describes the advantages of using renewable technology in a transparent environmentally friendly process. © 2020 Institut za Arhitekturu i Urbanizam Srbije.

AB  - The demand for biochemical energy and biofuels will continue to grow alongside the increasing costs for treating waste biomass. Thus, reducing costs and enhancing product value are not only key drivers for resource recovery development from waste biomass but also big challenges. Elongating carboxylates to medium-chains using lactate as an electron donor is a novel biotechnological approach. Driven by lactate, functional bacteria (e.g. Megasphaera elsdenii, Ruminococcaceae strain CBP6 and mix-culture microbiomes) elongate the shortchain carboxylates (e.g. acetate) into the medium-chain carboxylate, n-caproate. In this work, we determined the metabolic pathway of lactate chain elongation and listed the relevant functional bacteria. Thereafter, we reviewed the development of the lactate chain elongation technology in the context of converting organic waste streams into n-caproate, while summarizing both the advantages and the challenges of this technology. Given that organic waste streams (e.g. food waste, acid whey and liquor wastewater) usually contain a large amount of carbohydrates that can be fermented into lactate, this biotechnological approach could provide a promising opportunity for converting the energy embedded in the organic waste steams into n-Caproic acid without an electron donor (i.e. carbon source). We further analyzed the key factors affecting the performance of the technology, including pH, temperature as well as electron donors and acceptors. Hence, our proposed technology includes the dual benefit of low cost and high value in terms of its bioproducts, which would greatly improve production efficiency and sustainability. © 2020 Science Press.

AB  - The analysis of the performance of biofuel is aimed at evaluating the energy efficiency other physical-and-chemical parameters. The mathematical models and analysis techniques known to the authors do not take into account the effect that the use of different bio-diesel fuels has on the operation of the engine and, therefore, need refinement in terms of the mathematical expressions and empirical formulae that describe the physical processes taking place in the consideration the physical-and-chemical parameters of different types of fuel. The research methods proposed in the article are based on step-by-step consideration of the mathematical models of processes that follow each other, with due account for their possible overlapping, which indices. The boundary conditions and parameter increments are pre-set in electronic work sheets. Thus, it becomes possible, using the refined mathematical model, to calculate the main performance indices of the diesel engine with due account for the changes in the physical-and-chemical parameters of the fuel. The novelty of the described approach is in the possibility, through the use of the refined model and taking into account the data on the composition of the fuel and the design and operation parameters of the engine, to calculate the indices that allow evaluating the efficiency of use of specific fuels in the internal combustion engine under consideration. In results, formulas for the calculation of the effective power of the engine, fresh air charge density, excess air factor, effective specific fuel consumption and combustion pressure have been developed. Combustion pressure modelling and experimental data is presented. © 2020, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool. All rights reserved.

AB  - Butanol is an effective alternate source of energy to fossil fuels. The focus of this study is to investigate the effect of butanol blends on the micro gas turbine engine. A series of experiments were conducted to measure the performance and emission characteristics of the engine running at the different rpm in the micro gas turbine engine. Butanol is added to the Jet A fuel at different concentrations ranging from 5% to 20% along with 1% of pentanol. The blends are mixed with the Jet A fuel by ultrasonication process. The parameters, such as thrust, thrust-specific fuel consumption, CO, CO2 and NOx, are measured for different throttle settings. From the results it is evident, addition of butanol increases the thrust about 17.6% and the emissions such as CO, CO2 and NOx reduce profound levels compared with Jet A fuel. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Palm oil biodiesel (POB) has a number of beneficial properties of the environment due to less exhaust emission (carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, and smoke). It can lead to a reduction of pollution by decreasing the emission of harmful and hazardous substances to the atmosphere. In this work, palm biofuel was produced in house from crude palm oil with transesterification reaction carried out using a base catalyst. A low-speed agriculture engine under the variable load range of 3-12kg at a constant speed of 1500 rpm was investigated the several combustion characteristics under ASTM standards. The effect of a variable compression ratio (VCR) from 16 to 18 on low-speed engine performance and the gas emission were investigated in order to find out the optimal values of compression ratio (CR) low-speed engine. The experimental results are found that this engine fueled by the biofuel under test load at 12kg obtained the highest thermal efficiency of 27% at the compression ratio of 18, while its brake specific fuel consumption reduced with the increase of the test load. An increase up to CR18 presents the consistent explanation of the higher heat release and the shorter ignition delay, while the amount of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emission effectively reduced down to 42% and 21%, respectively. The optimum performance of the low-speed agriculture engine was found in CR value of 18 during full load condition. © 2020, Chiang Mai University. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the recent era, utmost attention is paid towards exploring the alternative source of energies, being more specific green energies. In modern days, when growing energy scarcity is a hot topic and considered as a global threat, in that context a green technology capable of sustainably addressing waste management issues and synthesize waste-derived end-product such bio-diesel from Jatropha Curcas linnaeus (JCL) and Chlorella vulgaris shall be paid ancillary attention. The attribution of the above-mentioned species and Lemnagibba L towards the purification of the municipal solid waste (MSW) leachate by utilizing its bioaccumulation properties and ultimately yielding several value-added co-products could be the solution of the era in terms of sustainable leachate treatment. A specially designed ridge furrow phytoremediation wetland was fabricated under the controlled environment associated with a pre-treatment facility and bottom lining system to captivate the downward percolation. A 1.5 m high Jatropha species were planted at an interval of 1 m on the ridges and the root for the same found to reach a depth of 0.8 m on an average over a period of 3 months. Leachate was supplied by means of free flow into the furrows with an initial addition rate of 1 m3 per day for a 10 m × 10 m remediation hybrid pond system and simultaneously the loading was elevated up to 80 m3/ha/day. Prior to the active remediation zone, a pre-treatment unit was installed which works on the bio-accumulation property of the vetiver grass (Chrysopogon zizanioides). A packed bed system of gravel, marble chips, sand, and coconut coir as a medium of filtration was installed to bring the concentrate waste juice up to the wetland treatment standard. Moreover, the bleaching influence of the sunlight also found to be effective against pathogen removal, active evaporation, and evapotranspiration. The ultimate treatment capacity for the designated size was assessed as ~0.03 m3 per day ascertained with an HRT value of 45 days. The ultimate outcome was on par with the influent characteristics obligatory for the tertiary units with a comprehensive efficacy value evaluated as approx. 60%. Thus, it’s quite evident to claim the feasibility of the present study towards the bioremediation of the enormous quantity of leachate generation associated with the handling of solid waste which is otherwise, a costly affair. © 2020 Global NEST.

AB  - The increased demand of fossil based fuel gases for the growing population has also increased its disadvantage of increased greenhouse gases and peak pricing these criteria has demanded a replacement of renewable and eco-friendly biofuel. Despite of failures of 2ndgeneration biodiesel the algal biofuel has emerged out to be a promising 3rdgeneration biofuel with its properties, availability and cultivation. The cultivation of algae for biofuel has an added advantage of treating waste water. The biofuel is derived from the purchased the algal oil (species) by the process of alkalic transesterification using methanol and sodium hydroxide( basic catalyst) in the molar ratio of 6:1 the obtained mixture contains ester and biofuel which is further processed using downstream technology such as extraction, centrifrigation and purified using vacuum drying or high performance liquid chromatography. Thus we could able to extract the biodiesel from algal. The emission and engine performance analysis test are taken with the help of the biodiesel. © 2020 Innovare Academics Sciences Pvt. Ltd.

AB  - The effects of supplementation of standard media with metabolic intermediates (2 g/L butyric acid, 2 g/L butyric acid + 1.5 g/L acetic acid) on butanol and hydrogen production/yield were evaluated. Fermentations were conducted with immobilized Clostridium acetobutylicum (DSMZ 792). Additionally, the influence of gas release modes (constant gas release vs. interval gas release) was tested in all setups to evaluate butanol and hydrogen production and yields. Fermentations were implemented in repeated batch mode (48 h, 37 °C, 100 rpm). Overpressure conditions had a negative impact on volumetric hydrogen production and hydrogen yield and a positive impact on butanol yield. Supplementation significantly increased the butanol concentrations in constant gas release mode, by 23.6%. When interval gas mode was applied in the supplemented fermentations, the butanol concentrations decreased by 8.4% when butyric acid was fed, and reached similar concentrations when both acids were added. The highest butanol concentration and volumetric butanol production rate of 9.6 ± 0.6 g/L and 0.2 ± 0.0 g/L*h, respectively, were reached with butyric acid supplementation and constant gas release mode. The highest volumetric hydrogen production was reached with the constant gas release mode in fermentations conducted with the addition of both acids, and reached 165 ± 9 mL/L*h. Highlights Interval gas release mode increased the butanol yield and decreased the hydrogen yield Supplementation of acids increased volumetric butanol production rate. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Biodiesel and its diesel blends have been accepted worldwide as potential renewable alternative fuels to substitute petroleum diesel. Perspectives for biodiesel commercial-ization using Camelina sativa L. Crantz as raw material are presented in this paper. Fatty acid profiles and the morphological characterization, including production, number of seeds, thousand seed weight and fatty acid percentage were analyzed for different varieties. A further assessment, considering four parameters, viscosity, iodine value, cold filter plugging point, and cetane number, was carried out to evaluate the biodiesel quality. It was concluded that camelina varieties have a similar percentage of fatty oil content. This work shows large differences in productivity and in the selected physical and chemical properties of derived biodiesel from camelina. Results show that varieties 1072, 117 and N5 (1.9) from Camelina Company Spain could be suitable due to their high productivity (over 4.2 g per plan)t. Variety 1109 could also be used due to its low iodine value (131). Varieties 1008, 1085 and 1109 could be used due to their high cetane number (over 51). This research has identified suitable varieties for biodiesel production. Further improvement of camelina’s characteristics is needed by means of plant breeding and manipulation of culture conditions. © 2020, Centro de Ciencias de la Atmosfera, UNAM. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study focuses on the use of thermophilic recombinant cellulases to produce fermentable sugars for conversion to bioethanol which is an important renewable energy resource to be worked upon due to climatic change, energy insecurity and nonrenewable nature of fossil fuels. Therefore, sawdust of pinus wood was subjected to pretreatment using different acids such as phosphoric, nitric, acetic and alkalis i.e. sodium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide and ammonia in various concentrations. Maximum delignification was observed using 8% nitric acid as it resulted in to 74.02% delignification and increased the cellulose availability to 81.8%. Subsequently, pretreated biomass was assessed for improvement in hydrolysis to less complex sugars employing thermophilic recombinant cellulases cloned from Thermotoga petrophila. Saccharification reaction parameters such as incubation time, temperature, biomass and enzyme concentrations were optimized. The optimized conditions were revealed as 3 h incubation time, 65 ºC temperature, 0.1 % (w/v) substrate, 250, 2550 and 70140 U of Endo-1,4-β-glucanase, Exo-1,4-β- glucanase and β-1,4-Glucosidase, respectively. This optimization study resulted in 34.61% saccharification yield which is 1.82 folds increase compared to saccharification yield of untreated biomass. This study is unique in providing insight to pretreatment using Nitric acid as in literature use of nitric acid as a pretreatment agent is not well investigated. © 2020, Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana Iztapalapa.

AB  - In the present study, the raw materials and produced bio oil were characterised in terms of physical and chemical properties. Response surface methodology (RSM) based on central composite was used to investigate the process parameter significance on bio oil yield. The statistical significance is indicated by P-value of less than 0.05 at 95% confidence level. For raw material, coal lignite spectrum showed potential existence of phenols, alcohol and water linked to mineral water associated to the hydroxyl group found in stretching vibrations that are between 3200 and 3400 cm-1. The oxygen containing groups such as C=O, C-O and also aromatic skeletal lignin from lignocellulosic materials. Sewage sludge spectrum showed presence of amide I, amide II, aliphatic methylene, lipids and fats. Si-O of clay minerals and silicates impurities were attributed by peaks 872 cm-1 and 1031 cm-1 on the primary sewage sludge spectrum. The produced bio oil results from Gas chromatography-Mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were in agreement with those of Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy results. Maximum bio oil of 42 wt% was obtained under the following conditions of; temperature, 550 °C, heating rate, 180.3 °C/min and particle size 425 µm. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Energetic efficiency of sugarcane mills in Brazil has been increasing in the past decades, generating a surplus of bagasse. Even though bagasse has a low energy density, it has been used as fuel in boilers. Pyrolysis, a thermochemical process, produces bio-oil and biochar, being an alternative to increasing the energy density of biomass. In this context, bio-oil, when compared to bagasse, is more versatile in terms of use, storage, and transport. However, this biofuel is typically a viscous, acid, and thermally unstable liquid, which is harmful to engines and boilers. Furthermore, polymerization of bio-oil occurs during aging, which increases viscosity, average molar mass, and water content. In order to avoid these problems, upgrading techniques can be used. These techniques are usually applied to the whole oil. Nonetheless, the upgrading may be more effective if the bio-oil is fractioned and each fraction is processed separately. This study assessed the upgrade of the heavy fraction of bio-oil (HBO) through solvent addition. Initially, two different concentrations (10 wt. % and 15 wt. %) of methanol, ethanol, and acetone were added into HBO. The mixtures were submitted to an accelerating aging process: Storage for 24 h at 80 °C. Physical properties including viscosity, pH, and water content were measured before and after storage. According to the properties analyzed, all blends met the appropriate specifications of ASTM D7544 (2017) for fast pyrolysis bio-oil. The results also indicated that all solvents had a significant effect on HBO properties, whereas their addition reduced its viscosity, improving stability. The blended HBO with 15 wt. % methanol achieved the lowest viscosity and aging rate. Therefore, in this case, methanol was more efficient than ethanol or acetone. © 2020, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - A pure interesterification reaction of triglyceride with methyl acetate in the presence of potassium tert-butoxide homogeneous catalyst produces a reaction mixture containing 72.5 wt.% of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) and 14 wt.% of triacetin. In order to harmonise the content of the reaction mixture by increasing the fatty acid alkyl esters (FAAE) and decreasing the content of triacetin, in this work a competitive interesterification - transesterification conversion of triglyceride has been made using iso-propanol. Due to the low reactivity of iso-propanol, it is possible to carry out the targeted harmonisation of biofuel composition by increasing the FAAE content up to 81.9 wt.% while retaining a relatively high triacetin content (6-9 wt.%). The lowering of the triacetin content and replacing it with the fatty acid iso-propyl esters provides the opportunity to obtain products that are more similar to conventional biodiesel and improve the cold flow properties of the fuel. © 2020, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - Recently, advanced biofuels have gained interest and importance; as a result, the world production of renewable diesel has quadrupled in the last 5 years. Renewable diesel is a type of biodiesel whose functional properties are similar, or even superior, to those of fossil diesel. It also looks more attractive than conventional biodiesel (FAME), as an option for the partial or complete replacement of liquid fossil fuels in the effort to reduce GHG emissions generated in the transport sector of diesel engines. However, when obtained by hydrotreating, the use of gaseous hydrogen makes the process lose sustainability due to its petrochemical origin (at least 90% comes from the reforming of naphtha) and high risk in its safe handling, besides increasing the costs due to its intensive operating conditions (temperature and pressure). A possible solution to this remarkable disadvantage is the generation of hydrogen in situ, which can be carried out by hydrogenation by catalytic transfer, using a donor, usually a solvent that transfers hydrogen. This is an interesting alternative for the hydrogenation of organic compounds, with substantial advantages over processes that use molecular hydrogen, in addition to moderate process conditions and reduction of the intensive energy consumption. In this sense, it is necessary to evaluate potential donors as renewable sources of hydrogen to obtain renewable diesel from palm oil. To carry out the previous analysis, in this study, a multicriteria decision method (MACBETH) is applied, using criteria such as renewable origin, decomposition products, cost, availability and toxicity, which are considered to select the most appropriate family of organic compounds that act as hydrogen donor: Alcohols, polyols, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, condensed aromatic homologs, amines and alkanes. Results show that alcohols, polyols and carboxylic acids are the most suitable organic families for the generation of hydrogen in situ during hydroprocessing. According to sustainability and taking into account the atomic economy, the availability and biorefinery origin, it was found that the most promising compounds to use as donors in each of these families are the ethanol, glycerine and formic acid, which are then evaluated using thermodynamic analysis. © 2020, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - Edible oil such has been used as raw material for biodiesel fuel (BDF). However, if the production of biofuel increases, it may compete with food and livestock feed and the price of oil may rise. Therefore, non-edible Jatropha curcas oil containing toxic phorbol esters has attracted attention. Recently a new BDF process which coproduct is not glycerin but triacetin has been developed. For triacetin can also be used as an anti-knock agent for biodiesel fuel, it is not necessary to remove triacetin from biodiesel fuel. The purpose of this study was to investigate the production of biodiesel fuel and reduction of toxic phorbol esters by transesterification of Jatropha curcas oil with methyl acetate. The formation of monoacetin, diacetin and triacetin was also confirmed by the spectrum estimated as the peaks of those substances. The peak of glycerin was not found among the major peaks of the chromatogram. As the molar ratio of methyl acetate to material oil was increased from 5 to 50, the yield of FAME was increased. The maximum FAME yield was 90 %. and the maximum concentration of FAME in the final product was 0.71 g/g. The concentration of phorbol esters in crude Jatropha curcas oil used in this study was 1.7 mg/g. The phorbol ester concentration of degummed oil decreased by a small amount from the crude oil. Phorbol esters decreased after deacidification and the concentration in phorbol esters in deacidified oil was 1.2 mg/g. The concentration in phorbol esters decreased to 0.22 mg/g after mixing step of oil with potassium methoxide. No phorbol esters were detected in any reaction time in the final product after the transesterification reaction in this study. The process used in this study is superior in that the phorbol ester contained in Jatropha curcas oil can be completely decomposed, compared with the conventional method using methanol as a raw material. © 2020, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - The performance and emission levels of a 160 N (35 lbs) thrust gas micro-turbine, running on blends of kerosene and waste cooking oil (methyl ester), were investigated over the take-off, cruise and idle phases of a typical flight profile. We considered three blends with biofuel volume fractions of 15%V (B15), 30%V (B30) and 90%V (B90). Relevant quantities such the thrust, the specific fuel consumption (SFC), the exhaust gas temperature (EGT), the unburned hydrocarbons (HC), and the production of O2, CO, CO2, NOx, were analyzed. Their time-weighted behavior was then plotted as a function of the blend type. It was found that an optimal fuel blend may be approximately defined by the equilibrium between two main contending factors: a) the production of thrust, and b) the amount of gas emissions. Also, it was observed that low blends (e.g. B15) produced thrust and SFC levels similar to those of kerosene, while high blends (e.g. B90) significantly reduced the gas emission levels at the expense of thrust production. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This research is on the introduction and the effect of the pre-treatment method on oil recovery from African oil bean seeds for biodiesel production. Samples were dried in the solar dryer, open sun, and the oven at 50 °C, 60 °C, and 70 °C. The solvent extraction process with hexane was used to extract oil from the product, and their saponification value, peroxide value, acid value, iodine value, specific gravity, and the color of the bio-oil were analyzed. The oil was further used in acid-catalyzed esterification and alkaline transesterification for biodiesel production, and the effects of temperature, catalyst concentration, feedstock to methanol molar ratio, and reaction time on biodiesel conversion were investigated. Solar drying of the seed yielded the highest volume of oil compared with other drying methods. Peroxide values of the oil meet the standard values from CODEX but showed an increase in rancidity in the solar-dried and open sundried products. Bio-oil produced has good lubricating properties as its iodine properties showed that it is not a drying oil. The cetane number and heating value of the biodiesel produced are within the range when compared with the ASTM standard of diesel properties. By using a feedstock to methanol molar ratio of 1:6 and a sulfuric acid concentration of 0.8%, a biodiesel conversion of 81% was obtained after 6 h of reaction at 60 °C. The biodiesel produced by this process met the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standard. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Microalgae, particularly Arthrospira sp., has been considered as an alternative energy for biofuel worldwide. It is one of the world’s largest organic nutrient sources and a potential source of biodiesel. Genetic analysis is an essential process of morphological identification confirming cyanobacterium homologous to the isolates identified in 100% of Arthrospira fusiformis at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank. The 16S rRNA sequences obtained by the genetic analyzer were deposited in the NCBI GenBank with accession number: MN160402.1. Arthrospira fusiformis was exposed to different doses of gamma irradiation 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 Gray (Gy) using Co60 as a gamma source. While the highest value of chlorophyll-a and carotenoid registered in the control unit was 7.437 and 6.733 µg/L, the lowest value was 0.423 and 0.643 µg/L at radiation treatment with 12gy, respectively. Likewise, carbohydrates reached the highest value (1.383 mg/L) in the control unit and the lowest (0.713 mg/l) in the radiation treatment with 12 Gy. Regarding proteins, the highest value was 640,387 mg/L when treated with 1 Gy, and the lowest value was 64,187 mg/L in the control unit. The highest value of total lipids was 0.633 g/L in the radiation treatment with 12 Gy, whereas the lowest value in the control unit was 0.283 g/L. These results confirmed the role of gamma irradiation in stimulation of proteins and total lipid content in Arthrospira fusiformis, which indicate the importance of gamma radiation in biodiesel production by algae species. © 2020 Alghanmi.

AB  - Increasing industrial production and global processes in the modern world lead to a significant rising in energy consumption which, as a consequence, causes the environmental damage. The development of unconventional and renewable energy sources should be seen as an important factor in improving energy security and reducing the anthropogenic impact of energy on the environment. In Ukraine, the large-scale use of renewable energy potential is not only of domestic but also of great international importance.It is a significant factor in counteracting global climate change, improving the overall state of Europe’s energy security (Heletukha H. H. аnd Zhelieznaia T. A., 2006). Therefore, scientists around the world are looking for the alternative sources of energy that could provide partial or complete energy independence. The soil and climatic conditions in Ukraine are favorable for the cultivation of crops with a high level of biomass energy accumulation during vegetation. Some unconventional crops capable of accumulating large biomass have significant prospects for bioenergy in Ukraine, in particular due to the fact that photosynthesis occurs over a long period-from early spring to late autumn. The results of studies of miscanthus productivity, biofuel yield and energy depending on the timing of planting rhizomes are highlighted in the article. The maximum yield of dry biomass of miscanthus plants is observed during planting rhizome in the second decade of April and is 15.3 t/ha, which contributes to the increase of yield of solid biofuels (up to 16.8 t/ha) and energy per unit area (up to 285.6 GJ / Ha). © 2020 Khakhula et al.

AB  - In this study, the environmental impacts of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) treatment and its conversion in anaerobic digestion to glycerol tertiary butyl ether (GTBE) were assessed. The production process is a part of the innovative project of a municipal waste treatment plant. The BioRen project is funded by the EU's research and innovation program H2020. A consortium has been set up to implement the project and to undertake specific activities to achieve the expected results. The project develops the production of GTBE which is a promising fuel additive for both diesel and gasoline. It improves engine performance and reduces harmful exhaust emissions. At the same time, the project focuses on using non-recyclable residual organic waste to produce this ether additive. The aim of this paper is the evaluation through Life Cycle Assessment of the environmental impact GTBE production in comparison with a production of other fuels. To quantify the environmental impacts of GTBE production, the ILCD 2011 Midpoint+ v.1.10 method was considered. The study models the production of GTBE, including the sorting and separation of municipal solid waste (MSW), pre-treatment of organic content, anaerobic fermentation, distillation, catalytic dehydration of isobutanol to isobutene, etherification of GTBE with isobutene and hydrothermal carbonization (HTC). The results indicate that unit processes: sorting and hydrothermal carbonization mostly affect the environment. Moreover, GTBE production resulted in higher environmental impact than the production of conventional fuels. © 2020. The Author(s).

AB  - The biodiesel inclusion in the Brazilian energy matrix still faces challenges due to the lack of diversity of raw material and the high costs associated with the stages of production, purification and phase separation of the biofuel. In this work, the potential of Catolé (Syagrus cearensis) was evaluated as an alternative source for biodiesel production, through methyl transesterification by alkaline catalysis. Given the absence of reported data on this oilseed, the aim of the present paper is to characterize the oil and biodiesel in terms of density, kinematic viscosity, and acid value. A liquid-liquid equilibrium (LLE) study of Catolé biodiesel-methanol-glycerin systems at 298.15, 308.15 and 323.15 K at atmospheric pressure was also carried out. Results showed that Catolé seed oil is a viable alternative for biodiesel production, with parameters found in accordance with the quality standards and an ester yield of 97.1%. Ternary diagrams showed that the solubility of the components lowers at low temperatures. Tie-lines evidenced higher affinity of methanol with the glycerin-rich phase. Distribution and selectivity coefficients were determined and the Othmer-Tobias and Hand correlations were applied to verify the quality of the experimental data. The determination indices (>0.97) proved the thermodynamic consistency of the data. © 2020, CI and CEQ. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Using biofuels is a general trend in transportation sector in many countries including Vietnam that aims to reduce both dependence on fossil fuel and environmental pollution. This paper presents the comparative experimental results of engine performance and emissions of a 4-cylinder, naturally aspirated diesel engine fueled by ethanol and biodiesel blended diesel fuels. The blends included DE5 (95% diesel-5% ethanol), DE10 (90% diesel-10% ethanol), DE5B5 (90% diesel-5% ethanol-5% biodiesel), DE10B5 (85% diesel-10% ethanol-5% biodiesel). The engine was tested at 100% of load while the engine speed varied from 1000 rpm to 3500 rpm, and at 75%, 50%, 25% of loads while keeped the engine speed constant at 3500 rpm. Results showed that the DE5 and DE10 blends caused a minor change in engine torque and fuel consumption whereas reduced quite clearly HC, CO and smoke emissions but increased NOx emissions as compared to the conventional diesel. However, blending 5% biodiesel in the DE5B5 and DE10B5 blends could help reduce a bit NOx emissions whereas the engine torque and fuel consumption nearly did not change and the other emissions in exhaust gas still significantly reduced. © 2020 Zibeline International Publishing Sdn.

AB  - In the present global scenario, fossil fuels are facing challenges due to escalating costs, increasing demand and impact on environmental pollution. In internal combustion engines, the emission characteristics and economy of the fuel are controlled by the chemical and physical properties of the fuel. Various additives are being used to act like catalysts with the fuels to improve quality of fuel, to obtain better combustion and to reduce exhaust emissions. At the time of combustion process, fuel instability reactions get accelerated by the catalysts which improve the performance of the engine. In this study, the B10, B15 and B20 fuel blends of cotton seed oil and diesel were mixed with the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as an additive to analyse the performance and exhaust emissions of a CI engine. The carbon nanotubes were mixed with each fuel blend with the concentration of 50 ppm. All the tests were carried out for different engine loads. Tested characteristics were power, brake thermal efficiency (BTE), specific fuel consumption (SFC), and analysis of exhaust gases like hydrocarbons (HC), CO2, CO and smoke. The experimental results showed that there was significant reduction of SFC and improved combustion by addition of CNTs. It was also observed that the exhaust emissions, CO, HC and smoke percentage got decreased by the influence of CNTs. © 2020 Technoscience Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - Diesel vehicles have higher fuel efficiency however they produce more particles than common gasoline motors. There are two efficient ways to drastically reduce those particulates emission from diesel motor. First particles filter, second biodiesel uses. Indeed the fuel composition has a direct impact on combustion, and therefore on pollutant emissions. A high content of biodiesel makes it possible to reduce the number of particles produced. The more the content of biodiesel in the fuel mixed, the less particles are emitted. When both filter and biodiesel technologies are used together the particles emission are almost inexistent. © K.

AB  - Catalytic cracking is widely used in biofuel production from natural fats and vegetable oils. Used cooking oils are one of the major wastes from food processing in Thailand. They are interesting raw materials to produce biofuel. This study focused on catalytic cracking of used cooking oils over two commercial (Z and Y zeolite) catalysts to generate light organic liquid products. The cracking reactor used was based on a fixed bed reactor setup. Temperature of reaction (400 °C) was controlled by a digital controller and a thermo-couple connected to the reactor. The liquid products obtained were subsequently analysed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The maximum liquid yield of 82.5 % was obtained. From the chemical analysis, the organic liquid products were found to contain three (gasoline-, kerosene-, and diesel-like) groups with the carbon number between C7 – C11, C12 – C15, and C16 – C21.

AB  - There is a waste solution containing glycerol derived from the biodiesel production, which can be treated in such a way that can firstly avoid the environmental contamination, and also can be profited some useful chemicals. From the chemical characterisation it can be transformed generally to bioethanol, but during this process can be produced also succinic acid and other possible end products. Fermentation seems to be the most suitable way of treatment of this residue solution, and that is why it was justified performing a detailed set of experimental characterisations of the waste streams from biodiesel industry. Getting newest information from other researches, the right direction seems to be necessary the preliminary and predictive research through process modelling and simulation in order to get the entire plant design for proper managing this waste solution. During this work has been determined experimentally the glycerol content in that waste solution, and then it was treated tentatively to reach the bio-ethanol. The latter was profiting using pretreatment processes and finally an anaerobic fermentation followed by a rectification process for concentration of the diluted alcoholic solution. Process simulation was performed using Aspen Plus computer software, which easily helps to construct and synthesise the process flowsheet with different mass input raw materials, until the threshold value of the feasibility for our country conditions, for the production capacities varying from 1000 up to 10 000 kg/h, and it was reached to some good results to be presented. © 2020, Scibulcom Ltd..

AB  - This work tries to identify the effect of compression ratio on the emission, performance and combustion characteristics of a diesel engine run on multi blended second generation biofuel. For this experiment a single cylinder, 4-Stroke, water-cooled, DI variable CR diesel engine and an alternate for diesel – multi blend of Waste cooking oil Methyl Ester (WME), Tyre Pyrolysis Oil (TPO) and Cerium oxide (CeO2) were used. Investigation has been conducted at various CRs (17, 16 and 14) in different loading percentiles by fixing the injection timing at 23 crank angle of BTDC. Investigation shows an improvement in Break thermal efficiency and a decrease in Specific fuel consumption as compression ratio increases. It is observed that a linear improvement in combustion properties like peak cylinder pressure and heat release rate happens when compression ratio increases. Due to high cylinder pressure and temperature the NOx emissions increase at higher compression ratio whereas Carbon monoxide (CO) and Hydrocarbon (HC) emissions are lesser in the same scenario. © TJPRC Pvt.

AB  - This study investigated the use of a blend of waste vegetable oil and diesel fuel in a diesel tractor engine by comparing the resulting particulate matter (PM) collected on a filter with the PM of diesel fuel. To this purpose, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and elemental analyses were carried out and the PM collected on the filters was examined via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The study also investigated the overall morphology of soot particles from the blend of 75% waste cooking oil (WCO) + 25% diesel (B75) in a diesel engine at three different loads (75%, 50% and 10%) compared with the morphology of the soot particles from diesel fuel (B0). The FTIR spectra of the B75 fuel exhibited the characteristic regions of oxygen bonds. Compared to the B0 fuel, the increased oxidation from the excess oxygen in the B75 fuel reduced the size and number of soot particles. It was also verified that the degree of unsaturation was related to the oxygen content of the B75 fuel. The FTIR spectra of the B75 fuel showed a C = O tensile band methyl ester in 1734 cm−1 and C–O bands at 1214–1362 cm−1. Furthermore, similar FTIR spectra were seen for the diesel fuel (B0) and the B75 fuel. The results showed a significant reduction in soot particle emissions with the WCO-diesel blend. The results of this research have enabled a better evaluation of the effects of different fuel usage on diesel engine combustion performance and emission characteristics. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Black carbon (BC) produced by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and biofuels has an important impact on human health and climate change. Based on the continuous online observation data of Tianjin from 2010 to 2013, the seasonal distribution, potential sources and health effects of BC in the atmosphere of Tianjin were analyzed. The average BC aerosol concentration was (4.49±3.26)μg/m3, which was the highest in autumn, the second in winter and summer, and the lowest in spring. The diurnal variation characteristics of BC concentration in different seasons were similar, showing a bimodal distribution in the morning and evening. The peak value in the morning was higher than in the evening. The concentration of BC in night was higher than that in day in each season. Mixed layer thickness (MLT) and near-surface wind affected the spatial and temporal distribution of BC under horizontal and vertical directions. Concentration weight trajectory (CWT) analysis showed that Hebei, Shandong and Henan were the main potential areas affecting BC in Tianjin. In addition, northwest regions such as Inner Mongolia and northern Shanxi affected Tianjin in autumn. The lifetime cancer risk (CR) of adults and children in Tianjin was higher than USAEPA given acceptable risk level (10-6), but the Hazard Quotien(HQ) was acceptable. Since the relative risk (RR) of respiratory mortality caused by high concentration of BC in autumn was 1.118, we need to pay close attention to the health risk of BC. © 2020, Editorial Board of China Environmental Science.

AB  - Depletion of petroleum based fuels has been a lot of concern among the governments and researchers around the world. Usage of biofuels in place of the conventional fuels is showing rapid growth because of the favourable characteristics like better performance and time improved emission characteristics. Present paper discusses about different available biofuels and their effectiveness in replacing fossil fuels and also how they affect the technological growth. Different works are compared to bring out the actual scenario with respect to the performance, emission, availability, production and preparation methods. It is observed that much effort is made by the stake holders in order to see biofuels as a viable alternative and as a future fuel for internal combustion engines. Performance improves slightly with the usage of biofuels and reduced emission characteristics may be logical to observe. But it may not be appreciable, considering the series of production processes involved. It still requires lot of time to commercialize and produce biofuels in mass. Also, there have been constraints like the availability of raw materials for the same. It is concluded that biofuels do play significant role in the days to come provided there is much more effort from researchers to simplify the technology in making biofuel as sustainable and cost effective with at least comparable performance. © 2020 River Publishers.

AB  - The effects of fuel injection strategies on the characteristics of common rail diesel injection engine using mahua methyl ester (MME20) blend have been investigated. Fuel injection strategies such as fuel pressure and split injection have been implemented on a test engine. When MME20 was used as the fuel on mechanical injection at an injection pressure of 22 MPa, specific fuel consumption and NOx emission were found to be increased and brake thermal efficiency (BTE) decreased. In the first phase, in order to optimise the utilisation of the mahua methyl ester blend, fuel injection pressure was increased from 20 to 50 MPa with an increment of 10 MPa. The experimental observation reveals that high fuel injection pressure (50 MPa) exhibits higher BTE and better combustion characteristics when compared with decremented injection pressures. HC, CO and smoke level decreased with an increase in injection pressure due to better-atomised spray and mixture formation. In the second phase, implementation of spilt injection 5% MME20 as pilot injection at 5°, 10° and 15° CA before main injection was identified with the decrease of HC, CO, NOx and smoke emission with marginal sacrifice of BTE compared with diesel fuel. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This case study investigates the potentials, greenhouse gas (GHG), and energy performance of forest residue biofuels produced by new and emerging production technologies, which are commercially implemented in Sweden for heavy transport. The biofuel options included are ethanol (ED 95), hydro-processed vegetable oil (HVO), and liquefied biogas (LBG) produced from logging residues in forestry and sawdust generated in sawmills. The calculated life cycle GHG emissions, based on the EU Renewable Energy Directive calculation methodology, for all three pathways are in the range of 6-11 g CO2eq./MJ, corresponding to 88-94% GHG emission reductions as compared to fossil fuel. Critical parameters are the enzyme configuration for ethanol, hydrogen supply systems and bio-oil technology for HVO, and gasifier size for LBG. The energy input is ranging from 0.16 to 0.43 MJ/MJ biofuel and the total conversion efficiency from the feedstock to biofuel, including high-value by-products (excluding heat), varies between 61 and 65%. The study concludes that the domestic biofuel potential from estimated accessible logging residues and sawdust is equivalent to 50-100% of the current use of fossil diesel in heavy-duty road transport in Sweden, depending on the biofuel production technology selected and excluding energy by-products. Thus, an expansion of forest-based biofuels is a promising strategy to meet the ambitious climate goals in the transport sector in Sweden. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - In the face of future climate change, Europe has encouraged the adoption of biofuel crops by its farmers. Such land-use changes can have significant impacts on the water balance and hydrological behavior of a system. While the heavy pesticide use associated with biofuel crops has been extensively studied, the water balance impacts of these crops have been far less studied. We conducted scenario analyses using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to determine the effects of farm-scale biofuel crop adoption (rapeseed) on a basin’s water balance. We found that rapeseed adoption does not support the goal of developing a sustainable agricultural landscape in the Czech Republic. The adoption of rapeseed also had disproportionate effects on a basin’s water balance depending on its location in the basin. Additionally, discharge (especially surface runoff ratios), evapotranspiration, and available soil water content display significant shifts in the rapeseed adoption scenarios. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The increasing use of alternative energy sources has brought benefits like the recycling of waste vegetable oils (WVO) for biodiesel production; however, this practice presents challenges derived from a highly variable raw matter. Our research focused on the washing techniques usually employed by small to medium scale producers which may lack the infrastructure to perform high-grade purification and often relay on the employment of “artisanal” technology. We report biodiesel production from pure canola oil (C1) and a mix of soybean/canola oil (C2) as well as WVO from sample C2 with high free fatty acid content (2.7 FFA %) oil. We selected seven quality tests: PH determination, cloud, pour and flash point, acid number (AN), water/sediments and soap content considering the most commonly failed checkpoints in biodiesel production. From the use of four washing techniques, we determined that the sawdust filtration had the highest recovering yield with 89%. The majority of the washed biodiesel met the America Society of Testing Material (ASTM) standard limits for the tests selected. Biodiesel stability was tested from week 0 to week 6, determining a shelf life of three weeks in optimal conditions without the addition of antioxidants or specific storage conditions. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Background: The German energy transition has entered a new phase and one important aspect is the question, to what degree the gas sector could be supplied with so-called “green” gases, i.e., gases from renewable sources. This paper focuses on the potential of domestic methane from biological origin (bio-CH4) until 2030 that is estimated with two different methods. The comparison of the results provides a consolidated estimate. Methods: In a bottom-up approach, a GIS-based cluster analysis was undertaken to estimate the potential on bio-CH4 from the existing cogeneration biogas plant (BP) stock. In a top-down approach a meta-analysis of GHG-reduction scenarios with respect to bio-CH4 was performed. The meta-analysis was also extended to methane from renewable electricity (e-CH4) since the BP stock may play a role in the provision of CO2. Further, it included the year 2050 (the target year for most scenario studies) as well as issues like energy imports. Results: The bottom-up approach yields a potential of 24.9 TWh of bio-CH4 for 2030. This is well within the range of the top-down analysis of 11–54 TWh (average: 32.5 TWh) for that year. In some scenarios values for e-CH4 where considerably higher, especially with respect to 2050, but in these studies the sources—including the CO2 sources—are either not explained at all or they are due to imports of e-CH4 in combination with direct air capture (DAC) rather than biogenic sources. Concerning the regional dispersion, the bottom-up analysis shows that the largest potentials (53% or 905 of the biogas plants) are located in the northern part of Germany, more particular in Lower-Saxony, Schleswig-Holstein, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. These represent 54% or 602 MW of the installed capacity of the clusters. Conclusion: The consistency of the outcomes of the two methodologically very different approaches may be called the main result of this research. Therefore, it provides a consolidated analysis of the potential for domestic supply of bio-CH4 in 2030. Furthermore, the amount corresponds to 2.7–3.5% of the German natural gas consumption in 2018. Taken bio-CH4 and e-CH4 together it corresponds to 7.2–8.0%. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - The use of biodiesel is important, as it is a more sustainable energy source, obtained in many cases from vegetable oils and wastes such as fried used oils. In that way, there are plenty of advantages derived from its use, such as higher flash and combustion points. On the other hand, the oxidative stability of these samples is shorter, not complying with the European standards. That is the reason why the use of antioxidants, such as butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), is vital to comply with the standards and make biodiesel marketable. The aim of this research work was to study the effect of BHA at different concentrations (up to 2000 ppm, depending on the kind of sample) on several biodiesel samples derived from several vegetable oils (rapeseed, seed, and used fried oils). The results obtained pointed out the improvement of the induction point for all the samples as BHA concentration increased. Moreover, there was an influence of the raw material composition (concerning fatty acid profile) on the induction point of the biodiesel obtained and the subsequent optimum concentration of BHA. Thus, the fatty acid profile was different depending on the sample, and the higher amount of methyl linoleate of seed and used fried biodiesel was important, which implied shorter induction points in these samples. As a consequence, for the latter, higher amounts of BHA (around 1400 ppm) were needed. As a conclusion, all the samples studied showed suitable oxidative stability values (over 8 hours) with the use of BHA (at variable optimum concentrations). © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - A series of heterogeneous acid catalysts are synthesized by supporting phosphotungstic acid on bamboo activated carbon and applied in catalyzing esterification for biodiesel production. With the activation of phosphoric acid, the obtained catalyst possesses the total acid density of 2.02 mmol g−1 and developed pore structure with specific surface area of 576 m2 g−1. It exhibits superior performance in catalyzing esterification of oleic acid with the maximum efficiency of 96% and acceptable renewability, where efficiency of 93% could be achieved by the regenerated catalyst. Density functional theory results indicate the activation barrier and reaction energy of the esterification are 19.73 kcal mol-1 and −15.83 kcal mol-1, respectively. This paper provides feasibility of the high value-added utilization of bamboo and basic theoretical data for esterification mechanism over heterogeneous acid catalysts. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Literature shows that the crude oil market has a vital link with subcomponents products, i.e., gasoline and diesel, and alternative energy markets, i.e., natural gas and biofuels. The biofuel industry is a promising solution for many problems such as global warming and high oil prices. Therefore, our paper explores the effect of structural crude oil market shocks on the real price of biofuel. We use structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model as proposed by Kilian (2009) over the period from March 1995 to June 2019. Our main finding reveals that long-run fluctuations in the real prices of biofuel are attributed mainly to global demand shocks and oil-market specific shocks, whereas oil supply shocks have an insignificant role. Our results also indicate that the three shocks combined can justify 68 percent of the variation in the real prices of biofuel, whereas the aggregate demand shocks are the most significant contributor because it justifies 35 percent, and oil-specific demand shocks explain 28 percent. The policy implication of our paper is that the stability of the biofuel market comes from the demand side, not the supply side. Thus, energy demand management is a critical tool to stabilize the biofuel market. © 2020 CEPII (Centre d'Etudes Prospectives et d'Informations Internationales), a center for research and expertise on the world economy

AB  - The present study explores the methodology for the synthesis of bio-oil from waste trichosanthes cucumerina seeds by the solvent extraction method. It investigates the yield percentage, concentration of free fatty acids and acid contents in the extracted bio-oil. Effects of size of the crushed seeds, moisture content, extraction time, solvent to seed ratio and extraction temperatures were examined. The non-polar hexane solvent resulted in a higher percentage of oil yield (28.4 ± 0.4%) for the crushed seed size of 0.21 mm, 6% moisture content, 270 min extraction time, 68 °C temperature and 6:1(ml/g) of solvent to seed ratio. The synthesized bio-oil was characterized using Fourier Transform Infra-Red spectrum and Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectroscopy analysis. The properties of the bio-oil and biodiesel were assessed according to the American Society for Testing and Materials and the Association of Official Analytical Chemists standards. The obtained methyl-ester by trans-esterification process results in the fuel properties closer to the conventional fuel. Thus, Trichosanthes cucumerina bio-diesel can be used as a potential substitute. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Turpentine from pine trees or from Kraft pulping is a complex mixture of monoterpenes, such as: α-pinene, β-pinene, limonene and myrcene. In this work, β-pinene was reacted with paraformaldehyde to synthesize an oxyfunctionalized turpentine (oxyturpentine) composed mainly by α-pinene, nopol and α-terpineol. This oxyturpentine can be a novel biofuel as far as its properties meet the criteria required by automotive fuel regulations. Binary mixtures of oxyturpentine with a diesel fuel (with no oxygen content) and with a conventional biodiesel have been experimentally characterized following the standard methods for each property (density, kinematic viscosity, lubricity, heating value, volatility, etc.) and the results obtained are critically compared using the limit values of European standards as a reference. Results show that the oxyfunctionalization of turpentine improves some relevant properties for fuel applications, such as lubricity, volatility and sooting tendency (wear scar was reduced around 40% and smoke point was increased more than 300%). With respect to other oxygenated compounds used in fuels blends, such as alcohols and esters, oxyturpentine can reduce the problems of high volatility and low viscosity and lubricity of the former ones and the cold behavior of the latter ones, indicating its suitability as a component of diesel fuels. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study aims to investigate the co-liquefaction of high-density polyethylene (PE) and low density polyethylene bags (PB) with sugarcane bagasse (SCB) in supercritical ethanol solvent. The effect of blending ratios of SCB/PB and SCB/PE is studied. Results indicate that blending ratio of low density plastic bags and high-density polyethylene impacts the product distribution during solvo-thermal process. The optimum conversion of SCB/PE and SCB/PB up to 57.3% and 59.4% with bio-oil yields of 31.5% and 30.3% respectively are obtained at 280 °C. The higher heating values (HHV) of bio-oil obtained from SCB/PE and SCB/PB are 34.9 and 34.8 MJ/kg, respectively. CHNS/O, chemical composition, carbon and proton NMR, Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses of bio-oil have been conducted. Investigation suggests that the SCB/PE and SCB/PB derived bio-oil have the superior qualitative properties compared to pure sugarcane bagasse. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The production of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) from waste frying oil (WFO) was studied using fly ash as received as a heterogeneous catalyst. The fly ash used in this research had a high content of both CaO and SO3, two compounds that have been previously proposed as catalysts in FAME production. The study was carried out on the basis of a response surface methodology (RSM). The model generated by RSM predicted as optimal conditions to obtain a 100% FAME yield at a methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 3.1:1, 11.2 (wt.% based on oil weight) fly ash and a temperature of 59 °C with agitation at 245 rpm and 6 h of reaction time. Additional experiments comparing anhydrous with aqueous medium showed that fly ash presented a high catalytic capacity to transform free fatty acids (FFA) into FAME through consecutive hydrolysis and esterification processes (hydroesterification) compared with that associated with the transesterification mechanism. According to the results, the fly ash used in this study would act as a multipurpose or “versatile” catalyst due to its chemical composition with constituents that act as acidic and basic catalysts, therefore, catalyzing the transesterification and hydroesterification reactions simultaneously and increasing the conversion yields of FAME. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Drop-in biofuels from forest by-products such as black liquor can help deliver deep reductions in transport greenhouse gas emissions by replacing fossil fuels in our vehicle fleet. Black liquor is produced at pulp mills that can increase their pulping capacity by upgrading some of it to drop-in biofuels but this is not well-studied. We evaluate the techno-economic and greenhouse gas performance of five drop-in biofuel pathways based on BL lignin separation with hydrotreatment or black liquor gasification with catalytic synthesis. We also assess how integrated biofuel production impacts different types of pulp mills and a petroleum refinery by using energy and material balances assembled from experimental data supplemented by expert input. Our results indicate that drop-in biofuels from black liquor part-streams can be produced for ~80 EUR2017/MWh, which puts black liquor on the same footing (or better) as comparable forest residue-based alternatives. The best pathways in both production routes have comparable costs and their principal biofuel products (petrol for black liquor gasification and diesel for lignin hydrotreatment) complement each other. All pathways surpass European Union's sustainability criteria for greenhouse gas savings from new plants. Supplementing black liquor with pyrolysis oil or electrolysis hydrogen can improve biofuel production potentials and feedstock diversity, but better economic performance does not accompany these benefits. Fossil hydrogen represents the cheaper option for lignin hydrotreatment by some margin, but greenhouse gas savings from renewable hydrogen are nearly twice as great. Research on lignin upgrading in industrial conditions is recommended for reducing the presently significant performance uncertainties. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - This work investigates the effect of NaZSM-5 zeolite’s acid properties on the catalytic cracking of crude soybean to produce gasoline-like hydrocarbons. We modified both the acid concentration and the acid strength of the NaZSM-5(60) zeolite (where 60 denotes the SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio) either by varying the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio (i.e., 30, and 90) or by exchanging the compensation cation (i.e., from Na+ to H+). Given the ammonia temperature-programmed desorption and temperature-programmed oxidation tests, we observed that the acid strength of the catalyst is associated not only with the distribution of the cracking products, but also with the nature of the carbonaceous deposits formed during the reaction. Weak, medium, and strong acidity were associated with the formation of heavy hydrocarbon species, soft, and hard coke, respectively. The NaZSM-5 zeolites exhibited weak and medium acidity, while the HZSM-5(60) zeolite exhibited weak and strong acidity. Although both NaZSM-5(30) and HZSM-5(60) zeolites delivered higher gasoline yield than the NaZSM-5(60) zeolite due to its higher acid concentration, the HZSM-5(60) zeolite formed carbonaceous deposits with lower reactivity (i.e., hard coke). Therefore, low values of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio in the NaZSM-5 zeolite drive the reaction products towards gasoline-like hydrocarbons and favor the catalyst reactivation through the formation of more reactive carbonaceous deposits. © 2020, Associação Brasileira de Engenharia Química.

AB  - Microalgae (MA) was co-liquefied with sweet potato waste (SPW) to improve bio-oil and bio-char qualities via Mannich reaction. The influence of Mannich reaction on combustion performances of bio-oil and bio-char were investigated. Results suggested that the addition of SPW decrease the ignition temperature of bio-oil from 186.6 °C to 165.0 °C. In addition, the denitrification effect of Mannich reaction can decrease the HCN and NO emission of bio-oil, contributing to reducing pollutant emission. As for bio-char, Mannich reaction improved the combustible material content in bio-char, which decreased the risk of slagging problem. The comprehensive combustion indexes of bio-oil (1.23 × 10−6 × min−2×°C−3) and bio-char (4.79 × 10−8 × min−2×°C−3) from co-liquefaction were higher than those from liquefaction of MA (0.91 × 10−6 × min−2×°C−3 for bio-oil and 1.24 × 10−8 × min−2×°C−3 for bio-char), indicating that the combustion performance was promoted by adding SPW. Overall, Mannich reaction can be applied to improve the combustion performance of bio-oil and bio-char. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Significant growth in the aviation industry has also raised concern on the impact of this sector in terms of environmental pollution. Bio-derived fuels are going to play an important role as potential alternative aviation fuels in the near future to mitigate the carbon footprint. Ethanol is a candidate biofuel which is widely used in many countries in the petrol-ethanol blend for S.I. engines. However, the interest in utilizing biofuels in aviation gas turbine engines is relatively recent. In comparison to ethanol, n-butanol possesses some better fuel properties such as higher energy density, less hygroscopic, lower vapor pressure, higher flash point. Butyl butyrate is another potential candidate which can fulfill the chemical property requirements of alternative aviation fuels. However, compatible substitutes for currently used aviation fuel (such as Jet A-1) are still at the early stage of development. The present study deals with experimental investigations of combustion characteristics of aviation kerosene (Jet A-1), butanol, butyl butyrate, and blends of the last two fuels with Jet A-1 in a swirl-stabilized gas turbine type combustor. Visualization of flame, measurement of temperature inside the flame, and exhaust emissions at the combustor exit are carried out to compare the performance of various fuels relative to Jet A-1. Spray penetration length, ligament length, droplet diameter, and spray cone angle of various fuels obtained using high-speed imaging technique are analyzed to understand the combustion characteristics. Fuel properties of individual fuels and blends are also measured and compared to probe the variation in spray and combustion performances. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The toxic kernel cake of Jatropha curcas (KCakeJ) is an emerging health and environmental concern. Although phorbol esters are widely recognized as the major toxin of KCakeJ, convincing evidence is absent. Here, we show that rather than phorbol esters an isomeric mixture of 11-hydroxy-9E-octadecenoic acid, 12-hydroxy-10E-octadecenoic acid and 12-hydroxy-10Z-octadecenoic acid (hydroxy-octadecenoic acids, molecular formula C18H34O3) is the major toxic component. The toxicities of hydroxy-octadecenoic acids on experimental animals, e.g. acute lethality, causing inflammation, pulmonary hemorrhage and thrombi, allergies, diarrhea and abortion, are consistent with those on human/animals caused by Jatropha seed and/or KCakeJ. The hydroxyl group and the double bond are essential for hydroxy-octadecenoic acids’ toxicity. The main pathway of the toxicity mechanism includes down-regulating UCP3 gene expression, promoting ROS production, thus activating CD62P expression (platelet activation) and mast cell degranulation. The identification of the major toxin of KCakeJ lays a foundation for establishing an environmentally friendly Jatropha biofuel industry. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - This study aimed to design and construct a quadruple solar/hydro/biomass/geothermal hybrid system, using a techno-economic analysis for water/biofuel production as energy carriers. First, in the case of the ground source heat pump-assisted microalgal culture pond, three influencing factors including light intensity, salinity, and air injection were investigated for maximum biomass production. Then, in the parabolic trough collector, the flow rate of operating fluid, the used hybrid nanoparticles, and their ratios were considered for obtaining the highest thermal efficiency. After, providing a better solar still distiller for the highest water production efficiency, the pressure, fluid's flow rate, and the depth of solar still were investigated. Finally, the water/heart supply of producing biodiesel from the pond's biomass in the trans-esterified conversion reactor was provided from the distiller/collector. The results indicated that using a 300-lx light intensity, a 3-g/L salinity, and a 0.4-L/min air injection in the pond, a 3-L/min nanofluid, including CuO/GO (4:1) and mass fraction of 0.4 in the operating fluid in the collector, a 2.5-cm water depth under a 0.4-bar pressure in the distiller, and a 1.8-wt%/wt catalyst concentration under a reaction temperature of 55 °C at 50 min in the reactor would yield the best water/biofuel production efficiency of 55%/80%. © 2020 International Solar Energy Society

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. (JCL) commercial plantations in Mexico, one of the most important JCL origin centers, have failed due to a variety of biological, political and technical factors affecting their productivity. This study explores feasible sites of JCL cultivation as a potential source for biodiesel production in Mexico, given agroclimatic and agroecological considerations. We propose a GIS-based approach for estimating suitable and available lands to grow JCL by integrating an Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) in the ArcGIS software. Spatial analysis combined multiple data, different evaluation criteria, three land availability classes (high, medium and low potential) and took into account ecological, ethical, and political restrictions, and considering two scenarios with different restriction levels. Suitability and availability maps were generated using agroclimatic information (climatic, land use/soil, and climate change and extreme weather events risk) together with other socioeconomic factors. Approximately 15.3% of Mexican territory is available for JCL production yielding a biodiesel production of 9.683 Mm3/year. Amelioration of the available land is necessary to improve land selection. GIS-based analysis represents a first approach to establish a successful biodiesel project that avoids, competition with food or feed production, maintains biodiversity conservation, and promotes biofuel supply chain development. This procedure would also be applicable to other energy crops such as oil palm and Ricinus communis. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Contemporary societies are marked by constant tensions between the notion to improve sustainability and the reluctance to engage in uncertain changes. In any sector, the transition is a delicate and complex process that involves many actors, organizations, and institutions. Niche analysis approaches such as the multilevel perspective model (MLP) explain how such a process grows from innovation within a very restricted field to its generalized application on a global scale. Shipping is a sector particularly challenged by the transition process away from heavy fuel oil towards more environment-friendly alternatives such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) or even non-fossil alternatives. Within this industry, Norway stands as an early adopter and leader of the emerging transition. Drawing from a wide discussion of the treatment of scale in transition literature and from this national case study, we propose that the transition process can emerge not only from a local niche perspective, as widely documented in the literature, but can also be driven by changes at a much larger scale and initiated by new international regulations. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Biofuels used as biocomponents for transport fuels should meet quality requirements. Their properties have a significant impact on the proper functioning of the engine supply system and the wear of its components. Changes in the performance of biofuel functionality may already occur during storage. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate changes in selected rheological and tribological parameters of higher fatty acid esters depending on the time and method of their storage by considering different types of substrates used for their production. The presence of possible microbiological contamination, which may affect the examined parameters of biofuels, was also analyzed. The dynamic viscosity of the biofuels tested changed depending on the substrate used. The biofuel produced from waste oil had the highest viscosity. Tribological studies show that both the linear wear of samples and the friction moment were higher after the storage period. The acid number of the esters did not exceed the permissible value recommended by the standard. The type of raw material used for the production of biodiesel and the conditions of its storage affected biodeterioration, proved by the growth of microorganisms. The highest number of microorganisms was recorded in biofuels prepared from waste oil. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This paper presents a numerical analysis of the application of emulsified biofuel (EB) to diesel engines. The study performs a numerical study of three different guide vane designs (GVD) that are incorporated with a shallow depth re-entrance combustion chamber (SCC) piston. The GVD variables were used in three GVD models with different vane heights, that is, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 times the radius of the intake runner (R) and these were named 0.20R, 0.40R and 0.60R. The SCC piston and GVD model were designed using SolidWorks 2017, while ANSYS Fluent version 15 was used to perform cold flow engine 3D analysis. The results of the numerical study showed that 0.60R is the optimum guide vane height, as the turbulence kinetic energy (TKE), swirl ratio (Rs), tumble ratio (RT) and cross tumble ratio (RCT) in the fuel injection region improved from the crank angle before the start of injection (SOI) and start of combustion (SOC). This is essential to break up the heavier-fuel molecules of EB so that they mix with the surrounding air, which eventually improves the engine performance. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Compression ignition (CI) engines that run on high-viscosity fuels (HVF) like emulsified biofuels generally demonstrate poor engine performance. An engine with a consistently low performance, in the long run, will have a negative effect on its lifespan. Poor combustion in engines occurs mainly due to the production of less volatile, less flammable, denser, and heavier molecules of HVF during injection. This paper proposes a guide vane design (GVD) to be installed at the intake manifold, which is incorporated with a shallow depth re-entrance combustion chamber (SCC) piston. This minor modification will be advantageous in improving the evaporation, diffusion, and combustion processes in the engine to further enhance its performance. The CAD models of the GVD and SCC piston were designed using SolidWorks 2018 while the flow run analysis of the cold flow CI engine was conducted using ANSYS Fluent Version 15. In this study, five designs of the GVD with varying lengths of the vanes from 0.6D (L) to 3.0D (L) were numerically evaluated. The GVD design with 0.6D (L) demonstrated improved turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) as well as swirl (Rs ), tumble (RT ), and cross tumble (RCT ) ratios in the fuel-injected zone compared to other designs. The suggested improvements in the design would enhance the in-cylinder airflow characteristics and would be able to break up the penetration length of injection to mix in the wider area of the piston-bowl. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Forest biomass is the raw material most commonly used to produce quality pellets for domestic households. However, sustainable forest biomass is not available in all regions, but there are other potential raw material sources for biomass heating systems, based on pellets. There are a large number of olive trees in the Mediterranean area, but these are not used as renewable pellet fuel because the bark cannot be used as raw material to produce quality pellets. The aim of this study is to carry out a methodology to estimate the optimal sustainable bioenergy life cycle, and the amount of sustainable residue available (trunk wood) at the end of the life of the olive grove, by optimizing the benefits, through an analysis of costs and income of the whole life process. The methodology determines the potential value of the trunks of olive trees to be used as biomass, in the form of pellets in domestic contexts and in a specific geographical area. In a case study applied to Andalusia, it has been shown that the optimal renewable life-cycle is 97 years. If policies for agricultural and energy sustainability favouring this model were adopted, this region would produce 160,000 tonnes of pellets per year, and 266,500 tonnes per year, if extended to the whole of Spain. This has a potential for providing 70.17% of the current total pellet consumption. The extension of the model to other Mediterranean countries, such as Greece and Italy, would result in an additional 124,000 and 144,000 tonnes of pellets per year, respectively. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Biofuels have become in many countries an alternative energy source for transportation. This has led to the construction of large-scale biofuel refineries. However, this process is raising concern among local stakeholders where the refineries are being sited. Here, we used geospatial techniques to implement a landscape design approach to address societal questions and local concerns regarding the impacts of introducing large-scale production of advanced biofuel (2G). Spatially-explicit landscape design was used to integrate various components in the biofuel supply chain and understand environmental and socioeconomic effects at various levels. Different techniques and modelling approaches were brought together with active participation of local stakeholders to provide answers to varying questions of community relevance. The application of the approach to the analysis of the case of cellulosic ethanol production from dedicated crops in Sardinia (Italy) shows that the introduction of a large-scale biofuel refinery could lead to positive outcomes at local level in terms of habitat quality, employment, energy production and reduction of GHG emissions. However, negative effects are expected regarding water availability and the production of food and animal feed in the landscape. This form of integrated knowledge about benefits and trade-offs can be used by project developers and policymakers to steer the deployment of biofuel projects to advance high level policy goals while respecting local priorities and concerns. © 2020

AB  - In this paper, I examine the speculative dimensions of biodiesel production in Northeast Brazil under the National Program for the Production and Use of Biodiesel (PNPB), by focusing on the case of castor oil plant (Ricinus communis) in semi-arid Bahia, a promising flex crop that was said to generate social, environmental and economic benefits, especially for the historically marginalised Northeast peasantry. I argue that speculative practices over castor have relied on state policies and discourses as well as biophysical and biotechnological (im)materialities that are transforming agrarian relations in ways that compromise peasants’ control over their (re)productive systems while promoting the expansion of the agroindustrial frontier. By examining the everyday, performative and place-based character of speculative biodiesel practices and their uneven and contested socioenvironmental implications, this paper contributes to current political ecology debates on the nexus between agroenergy development, nature’s capitalist valuation and rural dispossession. © 2020 The Author.

AB  - Use of nano-additives in biofuels is an important research and development topic for achieving optimum engine performance with reduced emissions. In this study, rice bran oil was converted into biodiesel and graphene oxide (GO) nanoparticles were infused into biodiesel-diesel blends. Two blends containing (i) 5% biodiesel, 95% diesel and 30 ppm GO (B5D95GO30) and (ii) 15% biodiesel, 85% diesel and 30 ppm GO (B15D85GO30) were prepared. The fuel properties like heating value, kinematic viscosity, cetane number, etc. of the nanoadditives–biodiesel-diesel blends (NBDB) were measured. Effects of injection timing (IT) on the performance, combustion and emission characteristics were studied. It was observed that both B15D85GO30 and B5D95GO30 blends at IT23° gave up to 13.5% reduction in specific fuel consumption. Compared to diesel, the brake thermal efficiency was increased by 7.62% for B15D85GO30 at IT23° and IT25°. An increase in IT from 23° to 25° deteriorated the indicated thermal efficiency by 6.68% for B15D85GO30. At maximum load condition, the peak heat release rates of NBDB were found to be lower than the pure diesel at both IT. The CO, CO2 &amp; NOx emissions were reduced by 2–8%. The study concluded that B15D85GO30 at IT23° gave optimum results in terms of performance, combustion and emission characteristics. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The gas phase reaction of the ground state cyano-radical (CN (X2∑+)) with 2-methylfuran (2-MF) is investigated in a quasi-static reaction cell at pressures ranging from 2.2 to 7.6 Torr and temperatures ranging from 304 to 440 K. The CN radicals are generated in their ground electronic state by pulsed laser photolysis of gaseous cyanogen iodide (ICN) at 266 nm. Their concentration is monitored as a function of reaction time using laser-induced fluorescence at 387.3 nm on the B2∑+ (ν′ = 0) ← X2∑+ (ν″ = 0) vibronic band. The reaction rate coefficient is found to be rapid and independent of pressure and temperature. Over the investigated temperature and pressure ranges, the rate coefficient is measured to be 2.83 (± 0.18) × 10−10 cm3 molecules s−1. The enthalpies of the stationary points and transition states on the CN + 2-MF potential energy surface are calculated using the CBS-QB3 computational method. The kinetic results suggest the lack of a prereactive complex on the reaction entrance channel with either a very small or nonexistent entrance energy barrier. In addition, the potential energy surface calculations reveal only submerged barriers along the minimum energy path. Based on comparisons between previous CN reactions with unsaturated hydrocarbons, the most likely reaction pathway is CN addition onto one of the unsaturated carbons followed by either H or methyl elimination. The implications for the transformation of biomass-derived fuels in nitrogen-rich flames is discussed. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Although both biodiesel and n-butanol are excellent renewable biofuels, most of the existing research works merely use them as the additives for petroleum diesel. As the main fuel properties of biodiesel and n-butanol are complementary, the biodiesel/n-butanol blends are promising to be a pure biomass-based substitute for diesel fuel. In this paper, the application of the biodiesel/n-butanol blends on an agricultural diesel engine was comprehensively investigated, in terms of the combustion, performance, and emission characteristics. First, the biodiesel/n-butanol blends with 10%, 20%, and 30% n-butanol by weight were prepared and noted as BBu10 (10 wt% n-butanol + 90 wt% biodiesel), BBu20 (20 wt% n-butanol + 80 wt% biodiesel), and BBu30 (30 wt% n-butanol + 70 wt% biodiesel). It was found that adding 30 wt% n-butanol to biodiesel can reduce the viscosity by 39.3% and increase the latent heat of vaporization by 57.3%. Then the engine test results showed that with the addition of n-butanol to biodiesel, the peak values of the cylinder pressure and temperature of the biodiesel/n-butanol blends were slightly decreased, the peak values of the pressure rise rate and heat release rate of the blends were increased, the fuel ignition was delayed, and the combustion duration was shortened. BBu20 has the approximate ignition characteristics with diesel fuel. Both the brake thermal efficiency and the brake-specific fuel consumption of BBu30 were increased by the average percentages of 2.7% and 14.9%, while NOx, soot, and CO emissions of BBu30 were reduced by the average percentages of 17.6%, 34.1%, and 15.4%, compared to biodiesel. The above variations became more evident as the n-butanol proportion increased. © IMechE 2020.

AB  - Abstract: In this paper we present the reactive extrusion process as a method of lipids extraction from by-products of fish. The study focuses on two essential points which are by-product enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency of three fish types, and the technical feasibility of producing a biodiesel from the fish lipids. The parameters of extrusion process were optimized in order to extract the more important percentage of oil. The results of the extracted oil from the three fish types were compared with other techniques such as batch process. Following the enzymatic hydrolysis, the chemical composition and the total fatty acids percentage are determined for each fish oil types in order to select the suitable oil for biodiesel production. Then the selected oil goes through transesterification, and we recover the methyl esters. The results of this study show that the enzymatic hydrolysis of the fish by-products by using the reactive extrusion process is interesting. Moreover, the valorization of fish by-products allows the marine waste recycling while producing biofuel. The produced biofuel can be used as an additive in a diesel fuel.

AB  - To achieve a near zero emission footprint of combustion in power generation, introduction of fuels with low global warming potential, namely low-carbon or carbon neutral fuels and simultaneous reduction of harmful emissions through implementation of advanced combustion concepts is necessary. The study addresses this challenge experimentally by proposing a new approach which combines the benefits of highly oxygenated waste derived fuels, here represented by glycerol, and an introduction of external exhaust gasses recirculation (EGR) aimed for further reduction of NOx emissions. Thus, the recognized role of the high oxygen content in glycerol can positively influence the well-known penalties of EGR, which are commonly perceivable through elevated CO and soot emissions. The measurements were performed with an experimental gas turbine equipped with an exhaust heat regeneration system and feedback loop for 8% and 13% EGR content in compressor intake air. The proposed system layout represents a technically viable and cost-efficient approach for upgrading existent gas turbine setups with a goal to improve their emission footprint. Results confirm that with 8% and 13% EGR rate, NOx, CO and soot can be reduced simultaneously, thus improving the CO- NOx and soot- NOx trade off approximately 2-fold for each species. Additionally, underlying phenomena responsible for observed improvements while increasing EGR rate are identified as an increased soot reactivity, a competing effect of EGR related dilution and an increased primary air temperature together with spray related parameters linked to low stoichiometric ratio of glycerol. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The research of renewable alternatives to decarbonize the transport sector and to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels pushes towards the development of more sustainable solutions for fuel production. Among the diesel substitutes, hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) is considered one of the most promising options, since it can be blended with fossil diesel without limitations. In this context, this paper assesses the technical and economic feasibility of producing HVO using waste vegetable oil (WVO) as feedstock, with the help of a simulation model that maximizes the integration of renewable energy sources. The process to synthesize HVO requires a large amount of hydrogen that, in this study, is supplied through an upstream high-temperature electrolysis process occurring in solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs), which are fed by low-carbon electricity. The use of waste oils as feedstock eliminates the competition with food crops (e.g. soybean or rapeseed) and promotes the recycling of substances that need to be disposed. The results of the study prove the technical feasibility of a plant with an annual capacity of 100 kt of HVO, having an energy efficiency of 80%. Also, the breakeven point of such investment would be reached before the fourth year of operation, considering a WVO price of 400 €/t, which is assumed as target price. However, the uncertainty on the market prices of WVO, HVO and electricity, as well as on other fixed and variable production costs, can significantly affect the projected results. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Castor, a non-edible oil crop that flourishes even under extreme cultivation conditions, can be cultivated in wastewater with a lower cultivation cost than similar plants, e.g., rapeseed and soybean. This plant, containing seeds and lignocellulosic residues, has a promising perspective for biofuel production. The oil extracted from the seeds is inexpensive and can be efficiently converted to biodiesel, while the lignocellulosic parts are suitable for ethanol production after pretreatment with NaOH. Biodiesel typically produced from the fossil-based methanol; however, it can also be produced from the ethanol. In this study, ethanol used for biodiesel production is produced from the lignocellulosic residues (scenario 1), which are more sustainable and environmentally friendly; the process was compared with that of the methanol (scenario 2). In this study, techno-economic analyses were used to compare the technical and economic aspects of producing biodiesel from methanol and the produced ethanol. Simulations of the processes were carried out by Aspen plus software, and economic studies were conducted by Aspen Economic Analyzer. The prices of produced ethanol as a byproduct in scenarios 1 and 2 were USD 0.701 and 0.693 per liter, respectively, which are greater than that of gasoline. The prices of biodiesel produced as a primary product for scenarios 1 and 2 are USD 0.410 and 0.323/L, lower than the price of diesel in the Middle East region. The profitability indices for scenarios 1 and 2 are 1.29 and 1.41, respectively. Therefore, despite environmental benefits, the biorefinery based on producing biodiesel from methanol is more economically feasible than that produced from ethanol. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Producing sustainable biodiesel from oil crops has been a great challenge, especially for oil crops plantations that involve various small and medium stakeholders. Differences in plantation activities and environments create a unique sustainability profile for each oil crop that may impose more sustainability issues such as deforestation problems in oil palm plantations. This paper embraced the unique sustainability index profile of each oil crop, and an investigation was performed to evaluate the feasibility of integrating multiple oil crops into the existing biodiesel refinery to improve its economic and sustainability performances. The selection of the process feed is proposed to be based on oil crop properties such as iodine value, peroxide value and saturated and unsaturated fatty acid contents. The sustainability profiles considered in the study include deforestation, oil yield, fertiliser impact, water impact and carbon footprint. Case studies demonstrated that a more balanced sustainability index profile could be achieved at a higher production cost—from USD 6.43 billion·y−1 in a cost-saving-centric solution to USD 39.90 billion·y−1 in a sustainability-improvement-centric solution. The study provided excellent insight into the impact on production cost to achieve sustainability which can help stakeholders to evaluate the feasibility of integrating multiple oil crops in the system. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - In this study, the effects of glycerol ethers as a biobased additive on some important fuel properties of the diesel–biodiesel blend are investigated. For this, firstly, glycerol ethers are synthesized by the etherification reaction of glycerol with tert-butyl alcohol with the presence of Amberlyst-15 as an acidic catalyst. The process of synthesis is followed by analyzing product composition through Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. Lastly, synthesized glycerol tert-butyl ethers are mixed with a diesel–biodiesel blend, and the effects of glycerol ethers on the fuel properties are determined. The analysis results show that glycerol tert-butyl ether mixture consists of mono- and di-ethers of glycerol. Due to the dehydration reaction and hindrance effect, the tri-ether of glycerol is not generated. The outcomes of determination of fuel properties reveal that glycerol ethers can be blended with a biodiesel-diesel mixture without any significant change in the fuel properties by fully meeting the ASTM D7467 standard, indicating glycerol ethers could serve as a biobased additive to diesel–biodiesel blend. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The usage of locally produced pure rapeseed oil fuel (R100) according to fuel standard DIN 51605 in agricultural machinery can contribute to protecting the climate, water, and soil. Besides economic aspects, uncertainties concerning the long-term operation reliability and limited exhaust emissions of R100-operated agricultural machinery are hindering market entry. Thus, the aim of this research is to evaluate field experiences, such as downtimes and repairs, engine oil quality, and cold start behaviour, over a total period of more than 50,000 operation hours with 18 tractors. The tested tractors range from European Union exhaust gas stages I to IV and were configured for the use of R100. Additionally, performance, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter were measured on a tractor test stand. The tractors demonstrated their full functionality under usual Bavarian farm conditions in daily use. Within the tractor fleet, no serious engine damage was observed, while minor malfunctions and necessary repairs occurred just occasionally. The operational reliability of the tested rapeseed-oil-fuelled tractors seemed to be comparable to that of diesel-fuelled tractors. The results of recurrent power and fuel consumption measurements gave no indication of engine deterioration. Furthermore, measurements proved that differences in exhaust gas emissions between R100 and diesel operation were marginal. Tractor models with exhaust gas after treatment systems were characterized by low emissions of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter in particular. With the 18 tractors running on R100, about 220 tonnes of CO2eq per year were saved on average from 2015 to 2017. It can be concluded that the usage of pure rapeseed oil fuel (R100) in compatible agricultural machinery is an implementable alternative to diesel fuel and can make an important contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in agriculture. Nevertheless, there are some challenges to solve, particularly for modern agricultural machines with engines with exhaust gas aftertreatment systems. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - This study investigates the life cycle GHG emissions of jet fuel produced via the hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) pathway from canola grown in western Canada, with a focus on characterizing regional influences on emissions. We examine the effects of geographic variations in soil type, agricultural inputs, farming practices, and direct land use changes on life cycle GHG emissions. We utilize GREET 2016 but replace default feedstock production inputs with geographically representative data for canola production across eight western Canadian regions (representing 99% of Canada's canola production) and replace the default conversion process with data from a novel process model previously developed in ASPEN in our research group wherein oil extraction is integrated with the HEFA-based fuel production process. Although canola production inputs and yields vary across the regions, resulting life cycle GHG emissions are similar if effects of land use and land management changes (LMC) are not included; 44–48 g CO2e/MJ for the eight regions (45%–50% reduction compared to petroleum jet fuel). Results are considerably more variable, 16–58 g CO2e/MJ, when including effects of land use and LMC directly related to conversion of lands from other uses to canola production (34%–82% reduction compared to petroleum jet fuel). We establish the main sources of emissions in the life cycle of canola jet fuel (N-fertilizer and related emissions, fuel production), identify that substantially higher emissions may occur when using feedstock sourced from regions where conversion of forested land to cropland had occurred, and identify benefits of less intense tillage practices and increased use of summerfallow land. The methods and findings are relevant in jurisdictions internationally that are incorporating GHG emissions reductions from aviation fuels in a low carbon fuel market or legislating carbon intensity reduction requirements. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Key message: Differences in FAE1 enzyme affinity for the acyl-CoA substrates, as well as the balance between the different pathways involved in their incorporation to triacylglycerol might be determinant of the different composition of the seed oil in Brassicaceae. Abstract: Brassicaceae present a great heterogeneity of seed oil and fatty acid composition, accumulating Very Long Chain Fatty Acids with industrial applications. However, the molecular determinants of these differences remain elusive. We have studied the β-ketoacyl-CoA synthase from the high erucic feedstock Thlaspi arvense (Pennycress). Functional characterization of the Pennycress FAE1 enzyme was performed in two Arabidopsis backgrounds; Col-0, with less than 2.5% of erucic acid in its seed oil and the fae1-1 mutant, deficient in FAE1 activity, that did not accumulate erucic acid. Seed-specific expression of the Pennycress FAE1 gene in Col-0 resulted in a 3 to fourfold increase of erucic acid content in the seed oil. This increase was concomitant with a decrease of eicosenoic acid levels without changes in oleic ones. Interestingly, only small changes in eicosenoic and erucic acid levels occurred when the Pennycress FAE1 gene was expressed in the fae1-1 mutant, with high levels of oleic acid available for elongation, suggesting that the Pennycress FAE1 enzyme showed higher affinity for eicosenoic acid substrates, than for oleic ones in Arabidopsis. Erucic acid was incorporated to triacylglycerol in the transgenic lines without significant changes in their levels in the diacylglycerol fraction, suggesting that erucic acid was preferentially incorporated to triacylglycerol via DGAT1. Expression analysis of FAE1, AtDGAT1, AtLPCAT1 and AtPDAT1 genes in the transgenic lines further supported this conclusion. Differences in FAE1 affinity for the oleic and eicosenoic substrates among Brassicaceae, as well as their incorporation to triacylglycerol might explain the differences in composition of their seed oil. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel, mainly produced from soybean, is an alternative to replace fossil fuels and to decrease the Brazilian external dependence on petrochemical diesel. However, soybean represents almost 85% of biodiesel production costs and government subsidies are necessary in order to make biodiesel production feasible. A possible solution to this problem is to look to the steps upstream of alkaline transesterification, like oil extraction and refining, where co-products can be isolated, making the soybean processing chain a biorefinery. This work aims to economically evaluate this idea and to show the real impact of biodiesel and the co-products on the biorefinery profitability. Operational and economic parameters were obtained from literature and were adjusted according to time, place, and flowrate. As a result, it is shown that biodiesel production can be profitable, but it should not be seen as the main destination for soybean and provided there is a market for its other fractions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Due to the heavy consumption of the fossil fuels in the transportation sector and the furnace factory, a large amount of soot is discharged and seriously threatened the environment and the human health. The present work focuses on examining the characteristics of soot produced from iso-octane/2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) non-swirling and swirling inverse diffusion flames (IDFs). Morphology, nanostructure, graphitization and oxidation reactivity of nascent soot particles from 100% iso-octane, 50% iso-octane/50% DMF and 100% DMF IDFs were investigated by using high resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analysis, respectively. The effect of swirling on the soot characteristics was discussed. Results demonstrate that the nascent soot from pure iso-octane flames shows the morphology with liquid-like deposition and turbostratic nanostructure, while the soot from pure DMF displayed more primary particle with the nanostructure contained by many well-organized lattice fringes. Because the mixability of air and fuel under the action of swirling is higher than that of non-swirling condition, the soot particles from swirling conditions reveal more ordered nanostructure with longer fringe length and lower fringe tortuosity, as well as higher soot graphitization and lower oxidation reactivity. © 2020 Energy Institute

AB  - This paper addresses the issue of combining the usage of waste frying oil (WFO), as a feedstock, and a lipase produced in solid-state fermentation (SSF), as a biocatalyst, for semi-pilot scale production of biodiesel as fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). Two fungal mutants namely; Rhizopus stolonifer 1aNRC11 mutant F (1F) and Aspergillus tamarii NDA03a mutant G (3G) were used as a cocatalyst. The two mutants were cultivated separately by SSF in a tray bioreactor. The dried fermented solid of 1F and 3G mutants were used in a ratio of 3:1, respectively, for WFO transesterification. Optimization of several semi-pilot process stages including SSF and WFO transesterification reaction conditions resulted in 92.3% conversion of WFO to FAME. This FAME yield was obtained after 48 h using 10% cocatalyst (w/w of WFO), 10% water (w/w of WFO) and 3:1 methanol/ WFO molar ratio at 30 °C and 250 rpm. A preliminary economic evaluation of produced biodiesel price (190 $/Ton) is less than half the price of petroleum diesel in Egypt (401$/Ton) and is about 40.3% the price of biodiesel produced using a pure enzyme, which is a promising result. This strategy makes the biodiesel synthesis process greener, economical and sustainable. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The increasing global energy demand and environmental concerns around fossil fuels have been propelling research on biodiesel. Despite the benefits of biodiesel to the environment, its properties as a fuel are still not ideal. Babassu oil produces good quality biodiesel, but there are problems associated with its use as a fuel, mainly due to its susceptibility to oxidation. One way of improving the oxidative stability of biodiesels is by adding substances capable of hindering the oxidation process, the antioxidants. Most antioxidants used for biodiesel are synthetic antioxidants opposing the premise of using biodiesel, which is to be a better environmentally friendly alternative. Therefore, in this study three natural antioxidants were tested in the babassu biodiesel, for which an experimental design 23 was used. The viscosity, specific mass and oxidative stability of the samples were evaluated, and to determine the best conditions for the use of antioxidants, a statistical analysis was performed applying a variance analysis and the response surface methodology. It was verified that there was an improvement in the oxidative stability of babassu biodiesel for all the natural compounds tested with an improvement ranging from 52 to 92%. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Production of biodiesel (FAME) via transesterification of triglycerides with methanol in the presence of basic catalysts has largely increased over time despite the low value of the by-product glycerol. Interesterification of the same feedstock with methyl acetate allows to obtain biofuel with higher yield, as the by-product of this reaction, i.e. triacetin, can be included into the fuel composition. Investigation of interesterification with methyl acetate to oil molar ratio 18 at 55 °C during 1 h in presence of potassium tert-butoxide solution in tetrahydrofuran shows that after catalyst to oil molar ratio 0.1 slow increase of FAME and a decrease of triacertin content occur. Variation of catalyst to oil molar ratio does not allow to lower the content of intermediates below 19 wt%. An increase of methyl acetate to oil molar ratio from 18 to 65 reduces the mass fraction of intermediates to 9.5% and FAME to triacetin mass ratio to 5.2. The fuel characteristics of obtained products are close to or comply with the requirements of LVS EN 14214, excluding the requirements for FAME and intermediate content and density. The optimal region of methyl acetate to oil molar ratio as the reasonable compromise between the yield of the target products and removable excess of reactant could be from 24 to 40. © 2020

AB  - Renewable terpene biomass has attracting interest for producing high energy density fuel, particularly cycloalkane in the range of jet fuels. In this contribution, catalytic conversion of menthol to p-menthane was systematically investigated. Noble metals (Pt, Pd and Ru) supported on a Lewis-Brönsted acidic oxide (Nb2O5) were explored, considering the effects of reaction temperature and the balance between acid and metal sites. Catalysts kinetics were quite distinct, and Pd-based catalyst rendered the most active one. Yields of p-menthane of around 90% were determined over Pt and Pd catalysts, while it was only ~70% on Ru/Nb2O5, on which the formation of p-menthene was also observed. These results evidenced that the reaction proceeds as a cascade reaction at which acid-catalyzed menthol dehydration and metal-catalyzed cycloalkene hydrogenation lead to the aimed cycloalkane. Reaction temperature and the balance between acid and metal sites were shown to be the key aspects affecting catalyst performance. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In order to reduce the pollutant emission and alleviate the pressure of petroleum resources shortage and greenhouse gas emission at the same time, the use of clean and renewable alternative fuel for marine engines is a promising option. In this study, a marine diesel engine, which was modified to run in diesel methanol compound combustion (DMCC) mode, was investigated. After the diesel injection parameters were calibrated, and combined with a sample after-treatment device DOC (diesel oxidation catalyst), the engine could meet the requirements of China II legislation. The overall MSP (methanol substitute percent) reached 54.1%. The value of each pollutant emission was much lower than that in China II emission legislation, and there was almost no methanol and formaldehyde emissions. When methanol was injected into the inlet manifold, the intake air temperature decreased a lot, as well as the exhaust gas temperature, which were beneficial to increase engine thermal efficiency and improve engine room environment. Compared with the engine running in pure diesel mode, when the engine ran in diesel/methanol dual fuel mode, the combustion phase was advanced, and the combustion duration became shorter. Therefore, the engine thermal efficiency increased, and fuel consumption decreased significantly. © 2020

AB  - Polynuclear or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are known to be one of the most dangerous types of compounds of their class due to their carcinogenic potential. Some atmospheric PAH are measured and regulated to quantify the air quality. However, in order to better understand the presence of these compounds in the atmosphere it is crucial to study the PAH emissions sources. In this work, we analyze the particulate-bound PAH emissions, as well as their carcinogenic potential, from a typical baseline diesel engine using a promising alternative fuel obtained from the glycerol surplus in the biodiesel production industry. This advanced biofuel (Mo.bio) is a ternary mixture of residual glycerine-derived fuel (FAGE), a conventional fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) and a diesel fuel. Two operating conditions representative of the conflicting scenarios when studying polluting emissions (speeds of 50 km/h and 70 km/h typical of urban and extra-urban driving conditions) are used. In addition, with the purpose of deepening the understanding of the behavior of this new fuel, tests are carried out modifying the Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) ratio. The PAH samples are collected before the aftertreatment systems in order to assess the possible formation of PAH with this type of fuel and to evaluate the options of the aftertreatment devices. Sampling is carried out using fiber-glass filters, extracting the trapped PAH using Soxhlet method. The analytical procedure (liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection) allows to appreciate differences between the different fuels and modes of operation, observing higher emissions of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and dibenz[a,h]anthracene (DahA) for the diesel fuel than for the mixture containing residual glycerine-derived fuel. Therefore, it is concluded that the fossil fuel has a larger carcinogenic potential in these conditions, and that the Mo.Bio fuel may possibly expand the EGR ratio range without increasing the requirement of the particle filter. © 2020 Energy Institute

AB  - Abstract: Physicochemical properties of biodiesel are influenced by the characteristic of fatty acids including chain length, degree of unsaturation and composition of fatty acid. The aim of this work was to investigate the influence of Hermetia illucens fatty acid properties on biodiesel quality using a transesterification reaction. H. illucens larvae were grown on fruit waste and food waste. The harvested pre-pupae were processed into dry biomass and stored in a container for further use. H. illucens pre-pupae were transesterified with methanol in the presence of sulphuric acid as catalyst. The reaction was conducted using methanol to sample mass of 6:1, reaction time (255 min), reaction temperature (50 °C), and catalyst loading (20v/v%). Biodiesel quality was tested according to the ASTM and EN standard. The degree of unsaturation, long chain saturated factor and methyl ester composition of each biodiesel also influence the biofuel’s properties. Fatty acid extracted from the H. illucens biomass showed high saturated fatty acid (SFA) derived from both feeds. Lauric acids were found to be the predominant SFA. The properties of FAME produced under optimum conditions, including density, kinetic viscosity, copper strip corrosion, oxidation stability and cloud points were in accordance with EN 14214 and ASTM 6751 biodiesel standards.

AB  - Traditional methods of biofuel production using vegetable oils and aliphatic alcohols (alcoholysis) have a number of disadvantages. A new method of transesterification of vegetable oils with alkyl acetates (esterolysis) is proposed. Esterolysis solves the problem of alcohol content in biofuels. It is not necessary to remove alkyl acetates from biofuels because they act as promoters of diesel fuel combustion. A method of improving both technology of alcoholysis and esterolysis by modifying the temperature range is proposed. Chemical and technological bases of two-stage process of vegetable oil transesterification are developed. In the first stage, the oils are treated with glycerol (glycerolysis) in order to convert tri-acyl-glyceros of oil into mono-acyl-glycerols. The second stage is alcoholysis of mono-acyl-glycerols with ethanol (ethanolysis) or esterolysis of mono-acyl-glycerols with ethyl acetate. The temperature range of the transesterification process is improved using heat-transfer solvents. Comparison of material balances of technologies of one- and two-stage ways of ethanolysis and esterolysis showed a significant increase in the selectivity of the process, yield and quality of biofuels. Analysis of the obtained biofuels and mixtures, which contain 20 % of biofuels and 80% of diesel fuel showed the best physical, chemical and operational characteristics. Therefore, the blended fuels are promising area of biofuel technology. © 2020 Seville University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - The latest issue of Cytologia (Vol. 85, Issue 2) includes a regular paper on the long-awaited karyotype analysis of the primitive red alga, Cyanidioschyzon merolae 10D, by Kuroiwa et al. (2020) and a technical note by Miyagishima and Fujiwara (2020) introducing a method to induce a controllable gene expression system in C. merolae. In recent years, Cytologia has focused on introducing the latest research on microalgae and has published excellent papers, such as the two mentioned above. An analysis of worldwide trends in microalgae research based on a bibliometric study found that the number of published papers has increased exponentially since 1990 and 2008. The most relevant journals in this field are "Bioresource Technology"and "Algal Research."Similarly, the number of papers in Cytologia is increasing steadily. Much interest is focused on Chlorella and Chlamydomonas. The major keywords appearing in more than 1,000 articles are those related to microalgae culture, such as "biomass,""biofuels,""lipids,"and their applications, or methodologies such as "bioreactor."Today, microalgae are attracting attention (i) as sources of high-value compounds such as carotenoids, polyunsaturated fatty acids and phycobiliproteins, (ii) as whole biomass used as ingredients for food and feed, (iii) as extracts or processed biomass to produce biofuel and biofertilizers, and (iv) for bioremediation to ameliorate wastewater, soil, and polluted smoke. In this paper, we focus on how algae and microalgae are treated in Cytologia. © 2020 The Japan Mendel Society.

AB  - Cuba currently faces a limited availability of transportation to support the development needs of the country. Transport availability is mostly limited because of fuel shortage. Moreover, Cuba has an important production of sugarcane, with a significant potential to further increase its production. Using sugarcane-based bioethanol is a significant opportunity for sugarcane producer countries. There are different raw materials available in the sugar industry to produce bioethanol. Therefore, there are different scenarios to increase the production of sugarcane and energy cane, to increase bioethanol production. In this study, two scenarios of sugarcane and energy cane production were considered, from which there are eight possible scenarios of bioethanol production. These bioethanol production scenarios were matched with three transport scenarios, including a business-as-usual scenario, a scenario considering the use of bioethanol blends in standard gasoline and diesel engines, and the and introduction of vehicles running on high ethanol blends or pure bioethanol (i.e flexible fuel vehicles, and ethanol buses and trucks). In total, the production of sugarcane-based bioethanol might support from 4 to 58% of the yearly demand for transport energy in the transport scenarios. Additionally, the use of bioethanol as a transport fuel can potentially reduce transport-related greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 3–30%. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Seasonal variation in microalgal biomass production is a well-known challenge when optimizing economics for algal fuel conversion, especially given the fluctuation in biomass production between winter and summer. Wet storage offers significant potential for cost and energy savings compared to dewatering and dry storage. This study demonstrates the feasibility of preserving harvested Scenedesmus acutus biomass through wet anaerobic storage for use in biochemical conversion. Anaerobic storage effectively preserved biomass with minimal degradation of carbohydrates and preservation of lipids and proteins. Screening experiments identified optimal pretreatment conditions for stored biomass. Scale-up of pretreatment enabled fermentation of the hydrolysate to butyric acid and indicated no observable difference in conversion between unstored and stored biomass. Lipid extraction improved by a relative 12% for stored biomass. These results suggest that wet anaerobic storage can effectively manage seasonal variation in biomass production and is compatible with biochemical approaches for biofuel production. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This study is reporting the biofuel synthesis and characterization from the novel non-edible feedstock cocklebur seeds oil. The Cocklebur crop seeds oil was studied as a potential source for biofuel production based on the chemical, structural and fuel properties analysis. The oil expression and FFAs content in cocklebur crop was reported 37.2% and 0.47 gram KOH/g, using soxhlet apparatus and acid base titration method, respectively. The maximum conversion and yield of the cocklebur crop seeds non-edible oil to biofuel was pursued 93.33%, using transesterification process. The optimum protocol for maximum conversion yield was adjusted: 1:7 oil-methanol molar ratios, ZnO nano-particle concentration 0.2 gm (w/w), reaction temperature 60°C, and reaction time 45 min, respectively. ZnO nano-particle was prepared by a modified sol-gel method, using gelatin and the particle was XRD, TEM, XPS, and UV-vis spectroscopies. Qualitatively, the cocklebur crop synthesized biofuel was quantified and structurally characterized by GC/MS, FT-IR, NMR, and AAS spectroscopies. Quantitatively, the fuel properties of cocklebur crop biofuel was analyzed and compared with the international ASTM and EN standards. © Copyright © 2020 Ullah, Jan, Ahmad and Ullah.

The aviation industry has a unique opportunity to halve its global radiative forcing (RF) contribution by minimizing the generation of aircraft induced clouds (AIC). These anthropogenic (human-made) condensation trails create a greenhouse effect by absorbing or directing back to Earth approximately 33% of emitted outgoing thermal longwave radiation. The effect of AIC accounts for 2% of the Earth's total anthropogenic RF. The effect of reducing AIC on global warming is immediate (unlike CO2 emissions which have a 2-decade delay in affecting global warming). This paper describes the physics of AIC formation and RF to identify candidate interventions to reduce AIC RF: 1) reduce the quantity of soot generated, 2) reduce or eliminate ice crystal formation, and 3) modify RF properties of AIC. The highest utility and lowest costs is to reduce ice crystal formation by avoiding cruise flight levels in the atmospheric conditions that are conducive to AIC generation. Reducing soot through drop-in biofuels, and synthetic fuels, require significant investment to scale production. Options that require the redesign of jet engines or use of alternative fuels such as liquid natural gas and liquid hydrogen, require significant research and turn-over of the existing fleets. Fuel additives to suppress ice crystal formation, change the RF properties of ice crystals, or both, are still nascent research topics. The implications and limitations are discussed. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2020.

AB  - To address rising climate change problems, one significant task is reducing pollution in the transport sector by substituting fossil with biomass-based fuels. One of the potential production methods is by Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis. Both gasoline and diesel types of fuel can be produced. For FT fuels a carbon containing feedstock is needed as an end product, it can be processed in multiple ways using various systems, however the main parts of production are biomass preparation and gasification, where afterwards clean-up of the synthetic gas is required. A liquid form from the syngas is achieved via FT synthesis, after which hydroprocessing is needed for separating naphtha, diesel, and lighter-molecular-weight hydrocarbons or other components. For comparison of biofuel plants, the biomass of choice, production processes and end products were analysed, as well as economic feasibility of technologies, to determine whether the costs and investments required are reasonable for the possible outcome. © 2020 Agate Veipa, Vladimirs Kirsanovs, Aiga Barisa.

AB  - The oleaginous yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides has emerged as a robust host for production of microbial lipids as alternative biofuel feedstocks. Oxygen supply is a limiting factor for microbial lipid production, as lipid biosynthesis is highly oxygen-demanding. Vitreoscilla hemoglobin (VHb) is a protein capable of promoting oxygen delivery for anabolism. In this study, we developed R. toruloides with VHb expression for improved lipid production. The VHb expression cassette was integrated into the R. toruloides chromosome via the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. In shake flask cultures, the engineered strain 4#-13 produced 34% more lipids than the parental strain did. Results obtained under reduced aeration conditions in 3 L bioreactor showed that lipid titer and lipid yield of the engineered strain 4#-13 were 116% and 71%, respectively, higher than those of the parental strain. Under high cell density culture conditions, the engineered strain 4#-13 grew faster and produced 72% more lipids. Our results demonstrated that the VHb gene is functional in R. toruloides for promoting lipid production. The strains described here may be further engineered by integrating extra genetic parts to attain robust producers for more valuable products. This should improve the economics of microbial lipids to facilitate a sustainable production of biodiesel and other lipid-based biofuels. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - This paper demonstrates the study of performance, combustion and emission characteristics of a common rail diesel injection (CRDI) engine with the influence of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) (5, 15 and 25%) at various fuel injection pressures (400, 500 and 600 bar) under the effective load conditions (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100%). The experiments were carried out in a controlled manner using the CRDI engine fuelled with 80% (D80) diesel (98% purity) blended with 20% (B20) tallow biodiesel. The engine has been operated at a rated speed of 1500 rpm on all load conditions, fuel injection timings of 10°, 15° and 20° bTDC, fuel injection pressures of 400, 500 and 600 bar, respectively. Combustion-influenced performance characteristics such as variation of in-cylinder pressure and net heat release rate in J deg−1 are also studied with the above operating conditions. It was observed that the usage of 20% biofuel blend shows considerable improvement in combustion, and it further enhances with an increase in the injection pressures. Besides, EGR (up to 25%) reduced significant pollutants at higher operating pressures (600 bar) at higher load conditions. It was also observed that CO2 emission increased with increase in the % EGR with an increase in the load conditions. However, for CO emission increased up to 50% load condition and subsequently tends to decrease due to improved combustion at higher load; hence higher temperature. NOx, smoke opacity continue to increase with the increase in pressure and the percentage increase in EGR due to its attainment of adiabatic temperature, which leads to the pathway for the Zeldovich mechanism. The present work shows light on the usage of tallow methyl ester produced from the wastes in the tannery industry as alternate biofuel operating the CRDI engines without compromising its combustion and emission characteristics to deliver the same power as petro-diesel. © 2020, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - The study focuses on the partial hydrogenation of a C18:3-rich FAME mixture (α-linolenate/linoleate: ∼3.5:1 mol/mol) taken as a model of FAME materials obtainable from alternative non-edible oils deriving from non-food biomass, which are suitable feedstocks for 2nd generation biodiesel. High C18:1 yield and selectivity required an accurate control of reaction time and temperature because of stearate generation through consecutive reactions C18:3→C18:2→C18:1→C18:0. In n-heptane, under mild conditions (50 °C, 0.1 MPa H2, 1 h), the FAME mixture was converted over Pd(5%)/C into C18:1 selectively (97.8%), with high yield (81.1%). The final mixture was C18:3-free (0.1%) and showed a low content of stearate (2.0%). Also the C18:2 component was markedly reduced (21.5%→16.7%). The content of trans-C18:1-monoenes was 39.0%. A lower content of trans-C18:1 (16.4%) was attained at 0 °C (1.5 h). Under the latter conditions, stearate and C18:3 in the final product were, respectively, 3.3% and 1.5%. Remarkably, Pd/C can act as a tunable catalyst being able to promote effectively the full hydrogenation of the FAME mixture to stearate under uncommon very mild conditions (0 °C, 0.1 MPa) within a relatively short time (6 h). Under solventless conditions or in polar solvents (MeOH, THF, dimethyl carbonate), hydrogenation was slower and less selective than in n-heptane. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biofuel is a renewable fuel and can be used as a replacement for diesel. Pyrolysis oil can be derived from non-edible de-oiled seed cakes. This investigation focuses on the exergy investigation of a compression ignition (CI) engine to maximize the work exergy (availability) and minimize the destroyed exergy, powered by Aegle marmelos (AM) de-oiled seed cake bio-oil blends. A dual blend of diesel and AM pyrolysis oil was taken in ratios, F0 = 100 + 0, F5 = 95 + 5, F10 = 90 + 10, F15 = 85 + 15, and F20 = 80 + 20 and were tested on a constant speed CI engine at standard compression ratio. The investigational analysis exhibited that a high amount of oxygen content in AM pyrolysis oil blends increased the brake thermal efficiency and decreased the brake-specific fuel consumption compared with diesel (F0). The owing exergy efficiency was obtained from the F20 blend (57.21%) at 100% load (W). Based on the investigation, considering availability and performance behavior of F5, F10, F15, and F20 blends were suggested as suitable biofuel alternatives to diesel. © 2020 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Introduction. Jatropha curcas L., is a species with high oil content suitable for biofuel; however, due to its wild condition, the yield of fruit and oil is low; therefore, it warrants genetic improvement. Objective. To know the productive performance of J. curcas in three ecoregions of Colombia. Materials and methods. The work was carried out from 2012 to 2014. A randomized complete block design with fifteen genotypes in three ecoregions (dry Caribbean, Inter-Andean Valley and Orinoquia) was established. The AMMI model and its biplot graph were used to determine phenotypic stability of the fruit yield and with the oil yield the net benefit and the benefit-cost ratio were determined. Results. In two of the three ecoregions used; dry Caribbean and Inter-Andean Valley, J. curcas presented an accumulated fruit yield of 3.6 t ha-1 and 6.7 t ha-1, respectively; in the Orinoquia region the yield was less than 0.1 t ha-1. The cost of a liter of J. curcas oil was US$1.07 for Albania (dry Caribbean) and US$1.24 for Espinal (Inter-Andean Valley), higher than that of African palm oil (Elaeis guineensis) of US$0.89. Conclusion. The fifteen J. curcas genotypes used in this study showed the best productive performance in Albania (dry Caribbean) and Espinal (Inter-Andean Valley), and the CJC3 genotype was the one with the best fruits and oil production. © 2020 Ibero-American Law Institute.

AB  - Crop yields are important items in the economic performance and the environmental impacts of second-generation biofuels. Since they strongly depend on crop management and pedoclimatic conditions, it is important to compare candidate feedstocks to select the most appropriate crops in a given context. Agro-ecosystem models offer a prime route to benchmark crops, but have been little tested from this perspective thus far. Here, we tested whether an agro-ecosystem model (CERES-EGC) was specific enough to capture the differences between miscanthus and switchgrass in northern Europe. The model was compared to field observations obtained in seven long-term trials in France and the UK, involving different fertilizer input rates and harvesting dates. At the calibration site (Estrées-Mons), the mean deviations between simulated and observed crop biomass yields for miscanthus varied between −0.3 t DM ha−1 and 4.2 t DM ha−1. For switchgrass, simulated yields were within 1.0 t DM ha−1 of the experimental data. Observed miscanthus yields were higher than switchgrass yields in most sites and for all treatments, with one exception. Overall, the model captured the differences between both crops adequately, with a mean deviation of 0.46 t DM ha−1, and could be used to guide feedstock selections over larger biomass supply areas. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Biodiesel is a mixture of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) from either vegetable oils or animal fats. Although biodiesel biodegrades faster than diesel fuel, the impacts of this biofuel in environment throughout its biodegradation process should be investigated. For this reason, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the microbial activity, the phytotoxicity, and the formation of metabolites during biodegradation of the contaminated soil with biodiesel. Microbial activity was evaluated using culture-dependent methods in soil samples artificially contaminated with biodiesel—followed by pH adjustments. The formation of metabolites during biodegradation was identified using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Respirometric method was also applied to evaluate total microbial activity. Seeds of Cucumis sativus were sown in soil samples before and after biodegradation to expand our knowledge on the impacts of such metabolites in a eukaryotic test-organism. Culture-dependent assays successfully allowed the quantification of microorganisms during biodegradation. According to CO2 production, biodiesel initially acted as a biostimulation agent increasing microbial activity. Indigenous microbiota degraded biodiesel into smaller compounds such as pentane, free fatty acids, and methanol. Soil pH significantly dropped from 5.4 to 3.0 after 120 days of biodegradation as a result of high concentration of free fatty acids. These free fatty acids inhibited further microbial growth after biodegradation. It was proposed that correcting soil acidity during biodegradation would be enough to sustain microbial growth. However, pH decrease was just one of the factors that inhibited microbial growth and plant root development. It was proposed that biodegradation yielded toxic metabolites such as methanol. These metabolites contributed to impair the root elongation due to alcohol-specific properties to solubilize a wide variety of lipids within the seed. Therefore, the present study draws attention to metabolites from biodegradation of biodiesel and their potentially harmful environmental impacts. Biodegradation of biodiesel changes soil pH, as it generates metabolites that are phytotoxic, and reduces microbial counts (CFU g−1 dry soil). © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Light-absorbing aerosols, particularly black carbon (BC), have significant impacts on human health and the climate. They are also the least-studied fraction of atmospheric particles, particularly in residential areas of southern Africa. The optical characteristics of ground-based light-absorbing aerosols from Kwadela Township in South Africa are investigated in this study. Daily averaged ambient PM2.5 highest levels were 51.39 µg m–3 and 32.18 µg m–3, whereas hourly averages peaked at 61.31 µg m–3 and 34.69 µg m–3 during winter and summer, respectively. Levels of daily averaged light-absorbing aerosols were 2.9 times higher (1.89 ± 0.5 µg m–3) in winter 2014 than in summer 2015 (0.66 ± 0.2 µg m–3). In both seasons, hourly averaged levels showed bimodal diurnal cycles, which correlated with the PM2.5 diurnal patterns that indicated distinct peaks in the morning and evening. These diurnal cycle peak periods corresponded with the times of increased solid domestic fuel usage, road traffic, and also shallower boundary layer. On average, light-absorbing aerosols contributed a larger proportion of total ambient PM2.5 levels in winter (6.5 ± 1.0%) than in summer (3.4 ± 1.0%). The winter average Absorption Ångstrӧm exponent AAE(370/880 nm) (1.7± 0.5), indicated the dominance of brown carbon (BrC) from biofuel/biomass burning and/or low-quality coal combustion emissions. In summer, the average AAE(370/950 nm) (1.3 ± 0.7), suggested the presence of BC and BrC in the mornings and evenings possibly from fossil fuel combustion sources. At midday and at night in summer, the AAE was close to 1, suggesting more BC contributions from sources such as diesel emissions during this time. A combination of BC and BrC particulates dominated on 50% and 5% of the summer days, respectively, whereas fresh BC were only measured in summer days (23%). Residential solid-fuel and/biomass combustion are important sources of light-absorbing aerosols in this study region, with concomitant human health and environmental impacts. © The Author's institution.

AB  - Since antibiotics show hormesis effects in cyanobacteria at the nanogram per liter concentration level, the possibility for two commonly used antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline) to increase lipid productivity in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was assessed in the present study. The two target antibiotics significantly promoted (p < 0.05) the biofuel productivity of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 through the increase of both biomass and lipid content. Sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline significantly stimulated (p < 0.05) cyanobacterial growth by upregulating proteins related to cell differentiation, cell division, and gene expression; significantly enhanced (p < 0.05) the photosynthetic activity by upregulating photosynthesis-related proteins; and significantly increased (p < 0.05) the lipid content in cyanobacterial cells by downregulating carbohydrate catabolic proteins and carbohydrate transport proteins. Due to the altered expression pattern of biosynthesis-related proteins, the two antibiotics increased the proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids, while tetracycline reduced the proportions of saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. The changes in fatty acid composition may improve the combustion performance of biofuel. This study provided insights into the application of antibiotics in cyanobacteria-based biofuel production.

AB  - An experimental study of the kinetics of oxidation of dimethyl ether, n-butanol, and methane was carried out using emission and atomic resonance absorption spectroscopy. All experiments were performed in a shock tube behind reflected shock wave in a wide temperature range from 1890 to 3250 K at a pressure of 2.4 ± 0.4 bar. In all investigated conditions, the peaks of nonequilibrium UV radiation of electronically excited carbon monoxide CO(a3Πr) were observed. Besides, the resonant absorption profiles of atomic oxygen in the ground electronic state O(3P) converted to O-atom concentration profiles were for the first time measured at this temperature range. For simulating the CO(a3Πr) radiation experimental profiles a kinetic mechanism of its formation and consumption was developed. This mechanism was implemented into existing comprehensive detailed kinetic models (such as Ranzi et al. (2014), Vasu and Sarathy (2013), NUIG Mech 56.54 (2013), GRI-Mech 3.0 (1999) and Alviso et al. (2018)), which were then tested on the obtained experimental profiles of atomic oxygen and electronically excited carbon monoxide. It was shown that the proposed CO(a3Πr) sub-mechanism nearly correct describes the ongoing reaction processes, however, complete compliance was not achieved. To elucidate reactions responsible for the differences observed, a sensitivity analysis was performed. As a result, the most important elementary reactions were determined. © 2020 The Combustion Institute

AB  - Abietic acid is one of the main compositions of rosin and tall oil, it has a tricyclic molecular structure, which could be further modified into a branched saturated bicyclic substance with the process of hydro-creaking treatment. Branched decalin and its derivatives are main creaking products from abietic acid, which are promising aviation fuel components since they owe high density, good thermal stability, and low freezing point. In this work, two routes for the target aviation fuel production with abietic acid as raw material were investigated, and their reaction conditions were optimized. Under the optimal conditions, target aviation fuel with a yield of 45.8% saturated bicyclic products was obtained through the route of hydrogenation-cracking process. Meanwhile, a yield of 42.2% was obtained with the route of cracking-hydrogenation process. The branched saturated bicyclic compounds obtained from both processes had excellent fuel properties. Especially, the pour point of the fuel was below −75 °C, which makes the product could be potentially used as bio-aviation fuel in special areas, or as additive to improve low temperature performance of conventional bio-jet fuels. The investigation of this paper provided an efficient and green way for the bio-refinery of rosin or tall oil. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Abstract: In this study, sulfated zirconia on MCM-41 prepared through a new ultrasound-assisted sulfation method for biodiesel production from waste cooking oil. The effect of different sonication times (15, 30 and 45 min) on nanocatalyst properties were studied using BET, EDX, FESEM, NH3-TPD, FTIR and XRD analyses. The XRD patterns along with the results of FTIR and BET analysis revealed the MCM-41 framework destruction while Zr doping and sulfation of nanocatalysts. The FESEM images of the nanocatalysts illustrated a well distribution and uniform morphology for the SZM(T = 45). The size distribution of the SZM(T = 45) were subsequently determined by FESEM images. Biodiesel production carried out under following constant operational parameters to evaluate catalytic performance of synthesized samples: 5 wt% catalyst loading, 60 °C reaction temperature, methanol/oil molar ratio of 9:1 and 6 h reaction time. Using ultrasound-assisted sulfation method in nanocatalysts preparation was increased dispersion of active phase and stability of synthesized nanocatalysts. Obtained results demonstrated that longer irradiation time in nanocatalyst preparation led to higher biodiesel conversion. Additionally, after five cycles, the sonicated sample showed higher reusability compared to non-sonicated one. Among the prepared samples, the longer sonicated SZM(T = 45) nanocatalyst showed the highest conversion (93.5%) and significant stability in biodiesel production. Graphic Abstract: Sono-sulfated zirconia nanocatalyst supported on MCM-41 was synthesized by an ultrasound-assisted impregnation/hydrothermal hybrid synthesis method. The effect of irradiation time was studied by changing time of the sonication (15, 30, 45 min) during the synthesis which led to different physiochemical properties of the nanocatalyst. It was found that, the performance of investigated nanocatalysts in biodiesel production from sunflower oil showed sonicated catalysts have higher conversion in comparison to non-sonicated catalyst. Biodiesel conversion in catalyst with 60 W and 45 min ultrasonic irradiation showed higher biodiesel conversion and also reusability in reaction environment.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Sixteen pongamia families were evaluated in a field experiment for eight consecutive years in dryland conditions to identify stable, high-yielding families. The trial was conducted in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Each family, consisting of nine trees per replication, was planted at a spacing of 3 m × 3 m. Yield stability was analyzed using (1) Eberhart and Russel’s regression coefficient (βi) and deviation from regression (Sd2), (2) Wrike’s ecovalence (Wi); (3) Shukla stability variance (σi2); and (4) Piepho and Lotito’s stability index (Li). Families were also analyzed for adaptability and stability using AMMI and GGE biplots graphical methods. The study revealed significant variances due to family and family × year interaction for pod and seed yield. Families performed differently and ranked differently across years. The performance of families was influenced by both genetic factor and environmental conditions in different years. Among families tested, TNMP20, Acc14, TNMP14 and Acc30 were high yielders for pods, and Acc14, Acc30, TNMP6, RAK19 and TNMP14 were high for seed yield. According to the Eberhart and Russell model, Acc30, TNMP14 and TNMP3 were stable across years. In the graphical view of family × year interaction based on AMMI methods, TNMP3, TNMP4 and TNMP14 had greater stability with moderate seed yield, and Acc14 and Acc30 had moderate stability with high seed yield. On the other hand, GGE biplots revealed Acc14, Acc30 and TNMP14 as high yielders with moderate stability. AMMI and GGE biplots were able to capture nonlinear parts of the family × year interaction that were not be captured by the Eberhart and Russel model while also identifying stable families. Based on different methodologies, Acc14, Acc30 and TNMP14 were identified as high yielding and stable families for promoting pongamia cultivation as a biofuel crop for semi-arid regions. © 2019, Northeast Forestry University.

AB  - Biodiesel has gained worldwide attention due to its renewable aspects. However, it needs more quality improvement. Recently, butanol has been considered as a favorable alternative fuel or additive over methanol and ethanol in compression ignition (CI) engines. In this regard, the present work deals with the evaluation of butanol–diesel–biodiesel blends as potential alternative fuels. In this work, biodiesel has been produced from Aleurites moluccanus oil followed by blending with Euro-diesel and butanol. Important characteristics such as kinematic viscosity, density and cloud point besides FT-IR, UV-vis spectra, TGA, DSC and NMR (13C and 1H) were analyzed. Some important engine and emission performance parameters, such as BP, BSFC, CO, HC, NOx and EGT were also studied in this work. Results revealed that blending butanol and Euro-diesel with biodiesel improves the properties of pure biodiesel such as kinematic viscosity (2.41–3.55 mm2/s) and density (841.8–884.6 kg/m3), while maintaining an acceptable range for cold flow properties that are analogous to Euro-diesel. In addition, reduction in BP (24.65–26.35%), HC (52.57–38.71%), and CO (39.18–30.4%) was observed for all the blends at full load compared to Euro-diesel. However, increases in both BSFC (38.17–41.14%) and NOx (24.18–8.35%) were observed. Overall, the blends appear to be good alternatives to biodiesel–diesel blends. Thus, butanol–biodiesel–diesel blends can be considered as potential sustainable fuels for fossil diesel. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Cyanobacteria are the oldest photosynthetic microorganisms with good environmental adaptability. They are ubiquitous in light-exposed habitats on Earth. In recent years, cyanobacteria have become an ideal platform for producing biofuels and biochemicals from solar energy and carbon dioxide. Alka(e)nes are the main constituents of gasoline, diesel, and jet fuels. Alka(e)ne biosynthesis pathways are present in all sequenced cyanobacteria. Most cyanobacteria biosynthesize long chain alka(e)nes via acyl-acyl-carrier proteins reductase (AAR) and aldehyde-deformylating oxygenase (ADO). Alka(e)nes can be biodegraded by a variety of cyanobacteria, which lack a β-oxidation pathway. However, the mechanisms of alka(e)ne biodegradation in cyanobacteria remain elusive. In this study, a cyanobacterial alka(e)ne biodegradation pathway was uncovered by in vitro enzyme assays. Under high light, alka(e)nes in the membrane can be converted into alcohols and aldehydes by ADO, and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) can then convert the aldehydes into fatty acids to maintain lipid homeostasis in cyanobacteria. As highly reduced molecules, alka(e)nes could serve as electron donors to further reduce partially reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cyanobacteria under high light. Alka(e)ne biodegradation may serve as an emergency mechanism for responding to the oxidative stress generated by excess light exposure. This study will shed new light on the roles of alka(e)ne metabolism in cyanobacteria. It is important to reduce the content of ROS by optimization of cultivation and genetic engineering for efficient alka(e)ne biosynthesis in cyanobacteria. © Copyright © 2020 Qiao, Wang and Lu.

AB  - Low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR) is a highly promising method for characterizing the different physical parameters and chemical structures of liquid fuels. In particular, there have been a variety of essential applications by means of time-domain NMR (TD-NMR). These applications can be developed for the characterization of petroleum fuels and biofuels, reaction monitoring, or process and quality control of liquid fuels. However, only a few applications have demonstrated the use of TD-NMR via on-line measurements. The principle of the majority of reviewed TD-NMR applications is based on finding the correlation between NMR and physical parameters. Special attention in this mini-review is paid to the description of on-line TD-NMR applications. Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Prosopis juliflora methyl ester (PJME) was produced from a non edible feedstock found in the arid and semi-arid regions all over the globe. The Biodiesel from this species was produced with respect to optimum transesterification process variables. An experimental investigation was done using the Methyl ester in a DI diesel engine to estimate the performance, combustion and emission characteristics at a brake power of 5.2 KW and an unvarying speed of 1500 rpm. Experimental studies on the methyl ester revealed that there was a decrease in the brake thermal efficiency by 8.34 % and increase in the emission of Carbon monoxide (CO), unburnt hydrocarbon (HC) and smoke by 10.7 %, 16 % and 11 %, respectively. PJME exhibited NOx emission of 10.71 %, lower heat release rate (HRR) of 23 %, and 7 % peak pressure when compared to neat diesel under 100 % loading condition. From the successive experiments conducted with Prosopis juliflora methyl ester, B20 Biodiesel blend was found the best suitable blend for marine engines as the results almost matches with the neat diesel. Also, biodiesel from this non edible species proved that it was an inherent source for alternative fuel, with environmental benefits. © 2020 National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources (NISCAIR).

AB  - Screening suitable strains with high temperature adaptability is of great importance for reducing the cost of temperature control in microalgae cultivation, especially in summer. To obtain high temperature-Tolerant diatoms, water samples were collected in summer from 7 different regions of China across the Northeast, North and East. A total of 731 water samples was collected and from them 131 diatom strains were isolated and identified based on the 18S rRNA sequences. Forty-nine strains out of the 131 diatoms could survive at 30C, and 6 strains with relatively high biomass and lipid content at high temperature were selected and were found to be able to grow at 35C. Cyclotella sp. HB162 had the highest dry biomass of 0.46 g/l and relatively high triacylglycerol (TAG) content of 237.4 mg/g dry biomass. The highest TAG content of 246.4 mg/g dry biomass was obtained in Fistulifera sp. HB236, while Nitzschia palea HB170 had high dry biomass (0.33 g/l) but relatively low TAG content (105.9 mg/g dry biomass). N. palea HB170 and Fistulifera sp. HB236 presented relatively stable growth rates and lipid yields under fluctuating temperatures ranging from 28 to 35C, while Cyclotella HB162 maintained high lipid yield at temperatures below 25C. The percentage of saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids in all the 6 strains was 84-91% in total lipids and 90-94% in TAGs, which makes them the ideal feedstock for biodiesel. © 2020 Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.

AB  - Used cooking oil is unsuitable to use again in the food process, but it may be harnessed as raw material in biofuel production. In this work, used palm oil was reacted via cracking over mechanically mixed catalysts between ZSM-5 and Y-Re-16 to generate organic liquid products (OLP). The catalysts used were known for high acidity and low cost for decomposition, degradation, and deoxygenation of triglycerides. The cracking experiments were conducted in a flow reactor. The experimental variables included reaction temperature between 300-500 °C, catalyst loading between 5-20 % w/w, and ratio of mixed catalyst between ZSM-5 and Y-Re-16 from 0-100 % w/w. They were set via response surface methodology and central composite design of experiments. Both catalysts showed good cracking reaction. The optimum condition for generating the OLP of about 85 % w/w was found at 300 °C, 5 % catalyst loading, 97 % ratio of mixed catalyst. The OLPs with different short-chain hydrocarbons between C7-C21 were identified. The main components were 71.43% of diesel, 12.11% of gasoline, and 8.95% of kerosene-like components. ©2020.

AB  - The widespread use of diesel/biodiesel blends as a transportation fuel can increase the risk of groundwater contamination, which requires remediation actions. Two pilot-field experiments were conducted to assess and compare their potential to treat groundwater contaminated with B20 (20% biodiesel and 80% diesel, v/v), using combined iron and sulfate biostimulation (CISB) and a modified Fenton system (MFS). A low-cost and sustainable product recovered from acid mine drainage was used to stimulate both iron- and sulfate-reducing conditions. The modified Fenton system was composed of magnesium peroxide to promote the slow release of hydrogen peroxide by magnesium peroxide decomposition. Fe2O3 recovered from acid mine drainage was used as catalyst for modified Fenton reaction. Both technologies demonstrated to efficiently degrade B20-blend aromatic hydrocarbons. However, the application of MFS maintained BTEX dissolved concentrations below the detection limit (1 μg L−1) over 22 months, while in CISB, the dissolved concentrations of BTEX compounds were &gt; 50 μg L−1 after 8.4 months. Additionally, total PAH dissolved concentrations in MFS experiment were lower than those observed for the CISB plot. In MFS, microbial growth was inhibited as opposed to CISB in which microbial growth enhanced up to 3 orders of magnitude. Therefore, though MFS was more efficient to meet remediation goals relative to CISB approach, if the site requires complete restoration, less aggressive technologies such as CISB should be considered. This novel pilot study presents chemical and biological technologies that can potentially be applied to remediate diesel/biodiesel blends in groundwater. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Renewable biodiesel with a high content of n-C17 alkanes was prepared through the catalytic hydrodeoxygenation of oleic acid under optimum conditions of temperature, reaction time and weight percentage of Ni deposited in γ-Al2O3. The hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) was blended with petrodiesel (20 % and 40 % of HVO) to evaluate its behaviour in a diesel engine. Comparative studies of power and emission of atmospheric pollutants such as NOx, CO, HC and smoke were evaluated under prepared blends and petrodiesel. The presence of HVO biodiesel at full load generated a slight decrease in power compared to petrodiesel; however, the decrease in emission of pollutants when using the blends containing HVO was significant. In the case of 40 % HVO were able to reduce more of 20 % of CO and HC emissions, and more than 40 % reduction in smoke when compared with petrodiesel. The NOx emissions of the blends with HVO had a significant slightly decrease. Further, the properties of Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts are justified by the results of EDS characterization, surface area (SBET), XRD, XPS, HR-TEM and it's capacity to produce biodiesel. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - Niobium oxide impregnated with sodium (Na/Nb2O5) was used as a heterogeneous catalyst to produce biofuel from conventional raw materials, such as soybean oil and beef tallow, and non-conventional feedstocks, including andiroba, babassu, coconut, crambe, macaw palm, palm, palm kernel, and jatropha oils. The trials were performed at fixed conditions using 10% catalyst at 78.5 °C under stirring (600 rpm) for 5 h. On the basis of the results generated by gas and liquid chromatographies, high catalytic activity was found for all tested feedstocks, revealing yields higher than 95%. The purity of the ethyl esters was validated by thermogravimetric analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance. The Na/Nb2O5 catalyst performed efficiently, converting the fatty acids present in the lipid raw materials to the ethyl esters, and showed high stability in consecutive batches, generating products that meet the specificity of international standards. The heterogeneity of the catalyst was also confirmed by determining the sodium concentration in both biodiesel and the catalyst after consecutive batch runs.

AB  - The detection of the dry alcoholate corrosion of aluminium is vital to design a corrosion resistive aluminium alloy for the storage and transportation of biofuel (methanol or ethanol). By synthesizing an Al3+ fluorescent probe operable in an alcoholic medium, we quantified the alcoholate corrosion in terms of the fluorometrically estimated soluble alkoxide (Al(OR)3) generation under nitrogen atmosphere. With time, a linear increase in corrosion with specific aluminium dissolution rate constants ∼2.0 and 0.9 μg per day per cm2 were estimated for aluminium and Al-7075 alloy, respectively. During open atmosphere monitoring, the adsorbed moisture converted small extent of Al(OR)3 to the insoluble Al(OH)3 at the alloy surface which retarded the alcoholate corrosion appreciably.

AB  - Agave americana L. is a highly productive, drought-tolerant species being investigated as a feedstock for biofuel production. Some Agave spp. yield crop biomass in semi-arid conditions that are comparable to C3 and C4 crops grown in areas with high rainfall. This study evaluates the bioethanol yield potential of A. americana by (1) examining the relationship between water use efficiency (WUE) and plant carbohydrates, (2) quantifying the carbohydrate and energy content of the plant tissue, and (3) comparing the products of enzymatic hydrolysis to that of other candidate feedstocks (Miscanthus x giganteus Greef et Deuter, Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench, and Panicum virgatum L.). Results indicate that (1) WUE does not significantly affect soluble and insoluble (i.e., structural) carbohydrate composition per unit mass in A. americana; (2) without pretreatment, A. americana biomass had the lowest gross heat of combustion, or higher heating/calorific value, compared to high yielding C4 crops; and (3) after separation of soluble carbohydrates, A. americana cellulosic biomass was most easily hydrolyzed by enzymes with greater sugar yield per unit mass compared to the other biomass feedstocks. These results indicate that A. americana can produce substantial yields of soluble carbohydrates with minimal water inputs required for cultivation, and fiber portions of the crop can be readily deconstructed by cellulolytic enzymes for subsequent biochemical fermentation. © Copyright © 2020 Jones, Zhou, Held and Davis.

AB  - As fossil fuels are depleted worldwide, alternative resources is required to replace fossil fuels, and biofuels are in the spotlight as alternative resources. Biofuels are produced from biomass, which is a renewable resource to produce biofuels or bio-chemicals. Especially, in order to substitute fossil fuels, the research focusing the biofuel (biodiesel) production based on CO2 and biomass achieves more attention recently. To produce biomass-based biodiesel, the development of a supply chain network is required considering the amounts of feedstocks (ex, CO2 and water) required producing biodiesel, potential locations and capacities of bio-refineries, and transportations of biodiesel produced at biorefineries to demand cities. Although many studies of the biomass-based biodiesel supply chain network are performed, there are few types of research handled the uncertainty in CO2 supply which influences the optimal strategies of microalgae-based biodiesel production. Because CO2, which is used in the production of microalgae-based biodiesel as one of important resources, is captured from the off-gases emitted in power plants, the uncertainty in CO2 supply from power plants has big impacts on the optimal configuration of the biodiesel supply chain network. Therefore, in this study, to handle those issues, we develop the two-stage stochastic model to determine the optimal strategies of the biodiesel supply chain network considering the uncertainty in CO2 supply. The goal of the proposed model is to minimize the expected total cost of the biodiesel supply chain network considering the uncertain CO2 supply as well as satisfy diesel demands at each city. This model conducted a case study satisfying 10% diesel demand in the Republic of Korea. The overall cost of the stochastic model (US$ 12.9/gallon·y) is slightly higher (23%) than that of the deterministic model (US$ 10.5/gallon·y). Fluctuations in CO2 supply (stochastic model) had a significant impact on the optimal strategies of the biodiesel supply network. © 2020 Korean Institute of Chemical Engineers. All rights reserved.

AB  - Deoxygenation by transition-metal-based catalysts is employed to produce a biofuel from fatty acids. In this study, the citric acid/CoMo ratio of an unsupported CoMo catalyst prepared by a sol-gel method was increased from 1 to 7 to investigate its effect on the physicochemical properties and performance of the catalyst. Deoxygenation was carried out at 300 °C under solvent- and hydrogen-free conditions. The CoMo-3 catalyst (e.g., citric acid/CoMo = 3) showed the highest oleic acid conversion rate, C9-C17hydrocarbon selectivity, oxygen removal rate, and biofuel product quality. This catalyst exhibited the best catalytic performance because it had the highest amount of active species (CoMoO4). Catalyst acidity considerably effected on the catalytic performance. Additionally, the citric acid/CoMo ratio affected the formation of single/mixed Co and Mo oxides. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.

AB  - Reduction of the environmental impacts of the individual transport segments is crucial with regard to air quality and population health. The main problem is a high level of nitrogen oxide emissions. There are some opinions that these emissions have a direct impact on the human health. Generally, a possible solution of this problem also offers application of the biofuels, i.e. fuels with the bio-component. Therefore, there was realized a scientific-research study focused on influence of the biofuels with regard to production of gaseous emissions in the case of diesel engine, which is used in ship transport. There were created various fuel mixtures with different content of the bio-component in order to investigate their emission characteristics. The measurements were carried out at different loading levels and with variable speed spectrum. The obtained results showed a considerable impact on the combustion process, on the heat release process, on time behaviour of the pressure and on the emission characteristics. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - This work numerically examines the quasi-steady spray combustion and soot development for soybean methyl ester (SME) and SME-ethanol blends (S90E10, S70E30). A validated reduced ethanol mechanism (37 species and 149 reactions) was formulated using a temperature sensitivity analysis under auto-ignition and jet-stirred reactor conditions. At initial pressures between 10.0 bar and 60.0 bar, initial temperatures between 750 K and 1350 K and equivalence ratios between 0.5 and 2.0, the ignition delays and key species profiles (C2H5OH, CO2, O2) of the reduced mechanism deviated by 0.5 order and 40%, respectively as compared to the experimental measurements. Subsequently, the reduced ethanol mechanism was combined with a reduced biodiesel mechanism to form a surrogate mechanism (102 species and 446 reactions) for biodiesel-ethanol blends and integrated into OpenFOAM for spray combustion modelling. Under reacting spray conditions at a constant ambient density of 22.8 kg/m3 and ambient temperatures of 900 K and 1000 K, the spray penetrations for SME-ethanol blends were shortened by 35.5% (maximum difference). Smaller flame areas with 60 K higher local flame temperature were obtained. Due to a 20% decrease in acetylene mass fractions and soot formation rates, the peak soot volume fractions for SME-ethanol blends were 19.6% lower. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The increasing importance of sustainability in energy production has led to a global commitment to the use of fuels derived from renewable biological sources, such as biodiesel produced from plant crops or biomass residues, that do not compete with human food for their production. For a biofuel to be considered biodiesel, it must satisfy the specifications described in the UNE 14214, with the UNE-EN 14103 referring to the determination of fatty acid methyl ester content. This standard applies gas chromatography as an analytical technique. Gas chromatography is a widely used technique in the analysis of methyl ester although it has a number of drawbacks such as: long analysis times, a high consumption of high-quality gases and internal standards, does not allow the analysis of different compounds with the same column, etc. From an industrial production point of view, is necessary to know the fatty acid methyl ester content in biodiesel samples quickly. This paper studies the development of an analytical method using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) as alternative to gas chromatography (GC), since it is a simple, rapid, and precise analytical technique to quantify fatty acid methyl ester content in biofuel samples. © 2020 AOCS

AB  - Fabrication of active, stable, and regenerable catalysts is the main purpose of researchers in which spinel-type catalysts can provide some excellent properties to utilize in chemical processes. However, some effective parameters on their properties and performance must be deeply evaluated. Therefore, in this study, the effect of Ni/Al ratio on the properties and performance of Ni-NiAl2O4 catalyst synthesized by solution combustion method was investigated. The sulfated structure of the samples was used as solid acid catalysts for the esterification of oleic acid. Various characterization techniques were carried out on SO4 2−/Ni-NiAl2O4 composites, and the results revealed that the increase of nickel concentration led to the formation of NiO and metal Ni which bonded strongly with sulfate groups during the impregnation process. The strong bands between Ni cations and sulfate group increase sharply the surface area (from 28.6 m2 s−1 for Ni/Al ratio = 1 to 35.4 m2 s−1 for Ni/Al ratio = 1.75) and the activity of the samples, consequently. However, higher amounts of Ni cations (Ni/Al ratio of 2) led to agglomerated particles that were detected on the surface which filled the porosities. It can cause to reduce the surface area and activity of SO4/Ni-NiAl2O4 nanocatalyst. The sample fabricated by 1.75 times of Ni/Al ratio presented the highest surface area, pore diameter (the most of pores are greater than 8 nm), less roughness and uniform particle size that converted more than 95% of oleic acid to ester at the conditions of 120 °C, 9 molar ratio of methanol to oleic acid, 3 wt% of catalyst and 4 h of reaction time. It was also remained active for four uses and was successfully regenerated after deactivation by re-loading the sulfate group. © 2020, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology.

AB  - In this paper, the accelerated degradation and oxidation of Jatropha biodiesel were carried out at 110 °C through the Rancimat method. The applicability of surface tension and UV absorbance in the fuel oxidation degree detection was studied through Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer(GC-MS) and acid value titration. The analysis of experimental data demonstrated that the acid value, surface tension and density of Jatropha biodiesel increased by 551%, 3.8% and 0.91% following oxidation, respectively, while the UV absorption intensity at 230 nm increased nearly 2 times. Subsequently to oxidation, the correlations among surface tension, UV absorbance and acid value of Jatropha biodiesel were 0.9743 and 0.9702. Based on this fact, four prediction models for the degree prediction of fuel oxidation through surface tension and UV absorbance were proposed, while the cross-validation method was utilized. The test analysis finally determined that the two models were Logarithm model and Power model, while the RMESP and R values were 0.093, 0.9875, 0.0705 and 0.9928. Both the accuracy and correlation were high. The acid value prediction model based on surface tension was 7.8%, while the acid value prediction model based on UV absorbance was 3.8%. Both could accurately determine the oxidation degree of biodiesel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This investigation is focused on the corrosion evaluation of an as-cast Al-7.5 wt% Si alloy and an Al/7.5 wt% Si composite immersed into distinctive biofuels. Immersions up to ~6000 h into three distinctive fuels are evaluated. A biodiesel B100, a mixture 1:1 between biodiesel and commercial diesel (B50); and mixture among biodiesel, diesel and commercial bioethanol (BDE blend) are considered. A novelty concerns to the adopted manufacturing route for the composite sample preparation is proposed. Commercial pure Al powders and pure Si particles are used. This provides different resulting microstructural arrays and consequently the distinct cathode-to-anode area ratios are also provided. It is found that into all biofuels examined, the Al/Si composite has lower corrosion susceptibility than the as-cast sample. Also, it is also found that the composite sample has a decreased corrosion behavior with increasing the water content. On the other hand, the as-cast sample shows a higher corrosion rate than the as-cast sample. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The large availability of glycerol on the market and EU directives in the field of automotive fuels prompt Eni S.p.A to develop a technology for producing biofuels from glycerol. This work focuses on determining isobaric vapor-liquid equilibrium data at different pressures of binary systems constituted by 3-ethoxy-1,2-propanediol, an intermediate product, and some of the other compounds involved in the reactions: water, ethanol, 1,2-propanediol, diethyl ether and glycerol. Moreover, the vapor pressure curve of 3-ethoxy-1,2-propanediol was determined at different temperatures. Finally, different thermodynamic models (UNIFAC, UNIQUAC, NRTL and Wilson), were tested against the experimental data to analyze their possible use when designing separation processes of 3-ethoxy-1,2-propanediol. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - For the past century, humans have been increasingly dependent on plastics, but have not developed adequate disposal practices. In this lab, students are asked whether burning plastic for energy seems like a reasonable disposal technique. To answer the chemical aspects of this question, students use bomb calorimetry to quantify the combustion energy of various plastics. The students confirmed the quality of their data by comparing their results from this experiment with current literature values for various plastic combustions. Their results also show that some plastics contain comparable amounts of energy to that of current fossil fuel and biofuel sources and that the energy content of the plastics vary predictably depending on the presence of oxygen in the polymer structure. At the conclusion of the experiment, students will not only have learned the technique of bomb calorimetry but will have also gained insight into whether burning plastic for energy makes sense from a chemical energy perspective.

AB  - The economical production of biodiesel from lignocellulose requires an effective co-fermentation of lignocellulose-derived sugars, such as glucose and xylose. Our present work discovered thatLipomyces starkeyiAS 2.1560 could produce microbial lipid effectively from co-fermentation of glucose and xylose in a two-stage culture mode under non-sterile conditions. High lipid production was achieved by a feed-batch fermentation process without sterility in the second fermentation stage. After incubation for 46 h in a bioreactor utilizing unsterile glucose and xylose solution, the cell biomass, lipid and lipid content reached 98.3 g L-1, 62.7 g L-1and 63.8%, respectively. The results showed that the two-stage fermentation method should be a promising process to produce lipid from lignocellulose hydrolysates. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.

AB  - This article is an experimental study conducted to evaluate the influence of the use of 0.15% dienitro on the diesel S50 and S10 with EGR (exhaust gas recirculation) system added with dienitro. The tests were performed with a gas analyzer directly on the exhaust of vehicles with engine speed of 1300 rpm. Measurements of CO and NOx gas emissions were carried out using a gas analyzer in S50 and S10 diesel buses with an EGR system from a company operating in the collective transport. Twenty measurements were performed without additives and twenty measurements with additivation in each bus, making it possible to calculate the average emission rate of CO and NOx, pollutant gases of toxic effect. The results showed that all additive fuels reduced NOx and CO emissions. This additive has a slight increase of 1 or 1.5 points in cetane number, low vaporization enthalpy (energy to vaporize), and high combustion enthalpy, i.e., dienitro increased cetane number, facilitating the start of combustion and reducing CO. On the other hand, a fuel that releases less energy during combustion consequently produces lower temperatures within the combustion chamber, i.e., additives with lower combustion enthalpy have lower NOx emissions. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Ship auxiliary engines contribute large amounts of air pollutants when at berth. Biodiesel, including that from waste cooking oil (WCO), can favor a reduction in the emission of primary pollutant when used with internal combustion engines. This study investigated the emissions of gaseous intermediate-volatile organic compounds (IVOCs) between WCO biodiesel and marine gas oil (MGO) to further understand the differences in secondary organic aerosol (SOA) production of exhausts. Results revealed that WCO exhaust exhibited similar IVOC composition and volatility distribution to MGO exhaust, despite the differences between fuel contents. While WCO biodiesel could reduce IVOC emissions by 50% as compared to MGO, and thus reduced the SOA production from IVOCs. The compositions and volatility distributions of exhaust IVOCs varied to those of their fuels, implying that fuel-component-based SOA predicting model should be used with more cautions when assessing SOA production of WCO and MGO exhausts. WCO biodiesel is a cleaner fuel comparing to conventional MGO on ship auxiliary engines with regard to the reductions in gaseous IVOC emissions and corresponding SOA productions. Although the tests were conducted on test bench, the results could be considered as representative due to the widely applications of the test engine and MGO fuel on real-world ships. © 2020

AB  - The aim of this work is to evaluate analytical tools for fast assessment of the catalysts’ ability to conduct a catalytic cracking process with the use of vegetable oils. The practical context of the presented concept relates to the use of cracking reaction products as valuable chemical raw materials. The proposed analytical tools allow for quick assessment of reaction products, indication of the molecular weight range, or the presence of specific functional groups. We want to emphasize that vegetable oils can not only be raw products for biofuels but also an alternative to petrochemicals. The study was undertaken to determine the influence of acid–base properties of catalysts on the rapeseed oil conversion process at 500°C. The effect of these properties on the character of the process and quality of the products obtained was shown to be very high. Basic correlations between the formation of coke, gaseous products and dehydrogenation products, and acid–base parameters of the individual catalysts have been observed. The use of spectroscopic methods (FTIR - Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, 1H NMR - Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) for fast qualitative analysis of the products is described. © 2020 AOCS

AB  - The present paper reports a viscosity and density unpublished database of systems formed for fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), leading to 426 experimental data points of each property. Kay's mixing rule and Grunberg-Nissan equation were used to estimate data and the group contribution models GC-VOL and GC-UNIMOD were used to predict density and viscosity, respectively. For surface tension, parameters of a Wilson modified equation were adjusted and tested in systems with composition similar to biodiesel. Density estimations resulted in global average relative deviations (ARD) of 0.02%, 0.07% and 0.15% for Kay's mixing rule weighted in mass and molar fractions, and GC-VOL model, respectively. For viscosities, GC-UNIMOD was the most accurate model with global ARD of 5.17%. The surface tension prediction resulted in global ARD minor than 7.00%. These results are an important tool to improve the biodiesel production, its modeling and simulation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Introduction. Jatropha curcas L. (JC) is a specie with the potential to use its oil as a biofuel and its quality is recognized by the composition of the fatty acids present. Objective. The objective of this work was the identification and quantification of fatty acids of JC genotypes of the Jatropha Colombia Collection. Materials and methods. During the years 2012-2014 the experiment was conducted in Espinal-Tolima, Colombia, in a randomized complete block design with fifteen genotypes. The lipid profile of the genotypes was determined by chromatography GC-MS and GC-FID. Results. Ten types of fatty acids were detected in the oil: five saturated (myristic, palmitic, margaric, stearic, arachidic); three monounsaturated (palmitoleic, oleic and eicosenoic), and two polyunsaturated (linoleic and linolenic). The proportion was higher in monounsaturated acids (45.44 %) and polyunsaturated acids (34.18 %) and lower in saturated acids (20.37 %). In the monounsaturated, the oleic predominated (44.62 %); in polyunsaturated linoleic (33.95 %) and in saturated palmitic (12.41 %) and stearic (7.43%). The results found allowed the classification of JC oil as monounsaturated-polyunsaturated (oleic-linoleic), which coincided with what was reported worldwide. Conclusion. Based on the lipid profile, it can be inferred that the oil of the fifteen genotypes evaluated in Colombia is suitable for use as biodiesel. © 2020 Agronomía Mesoamericana es desarrollada en la Universidad de Costa Rica bajo una licencia Creative Commons Atribución-NoComercial-SinDerivar 4.0 Internacional.

AB  - Alcohols are attractive fuel blendstocks for spark ignition engines due to their high octane values and potentially positive influence on performance and emission. Although methanol, ethanol, and butanol have been widely studied, other biomass-derived alcohols may have similar or better properties. However, it is not feasible to experimentally investigate the fuel potential of every molecule. The goals of this study were to develop a methodology for rapid screening of a fuel property database for mono-alcohols and to identify alcohols with the potential of blending to produce advantaged motor gasolines. A database was developed with 13 fuel properties of all saturated C1-C10 mono-alcohols. A decision framework was used to evaluate alcohols suitable for blending in gasoline for spark ignition engines in two scenarios: low-range (up to 15 vol%) blends and high-range (greater than 40 vol%) blends. The low-range blend cases resulted in the identification of 48 alcohols. In the case of high-range blending, only six alcohols were found to be suitable. This is the first study to systematically evaluate all C1-C10 saturated alcohols for blending with gasoline using relevant fuel properties. A novel aspect of this study is the evaluation of the influence of errors in predicted property values. These scenario screenings focus attention on a smaller number of promising candidate molecules, and the approach could be modified for other classes of fuel molecules, engine types, and fuel blending goals. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) extraction was applied on a raw biocrude, obtained by hydrothermal liquefaction of pinewood. The extractions were carried out in a semicontinuous mode, in the ranges of 80 to 150 °C and 330 to 450 bar. Extraction yields from 44 to 53 wt % were achieved. The extracts were richer in lower-molecular-weight (MW) compounds, with fatty acids and aromatic hydrocarbons concentrated up to 14 and 24 wt %, respectively. For comparable MWs, lower-polarity compounds concentrated in the extracts. Compared to the feed, the extracts exhibited a lower density (from 1030 kg/m3 down to 914 kg/m3), lower water content (from 5.7 wt % down to 1.3 wt %), and lower oxygen content (from 10.0 wt % down to 5.0 wt %). In addition, the metal content was drastically reduced (from 8500 mg/kg down to 170 mg/kg on average). In the context of biofuel production, the sCO2 extracts are a better feed for catalytic hydrotreating. Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Energy efficiency (EE) and energy performance (EP) are the main indicators of sustainability for a crop-energy supply chain. This study aims at assessing the sugar beet suitability as energy crop. Sugar beet was cropped under six agronomic treatments, varying in nitrogen supply and in soil tillage. The energy patterns were verified through four indicators. The treatment with the highest agronomic input provided an enhanced energy yield, on the contrary the mid-energy input scheme maximized net energy gain. “No nitrogen”, coupled with “No-tillage” treatment, achieved the best EE performance. Therefore, the most suitable agro-energy scheme does result tricky to recognize since contrasting information provided by the single energy indicators could exacerbate EP and penalizing EE, or vice versa. The synthesis of different information in a single (multi-metric) indicator was the main objective of this study. The multi-metric indicator from the fuzzy-based expert system, highlighted that “No-tillage” combined with “No nitrogen” was the cropping system which optimizes energy output and input. As for the highest nitrogen treatment, coupled with conventional or no tillage, the multi-metric index indicated these management unsuitable for the sugar-beet supply chain. A multi-composite metric, built on ad hoc modules, was fully described in this paper. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Both ultrafine particle and toxicity emissions originating from diesel engine gain an increasing concern. In this study, size distribution and toxicity of particles from a turbocharged common rail engine fueled with clean fuels—dimethyl ether (DME) and biodiesel blends—were investigated. Effects of different DME–biodiesel blends (B0, B5, B10, and B15) and different engine loads were considered. The results demonstrate that particles emitted from DME–biodiesel engine are mainly in form of nucleation mode. Engine running at intermediate load exhausts the maximum number of accumulation mode particles owing to local hypoxia and not high enough combustion temperature. The addition of biodiesel slightly increases the total particle number, peak of particle number concentration, and particle size corresponding to the peak. Effect of biodiesel proportion on particle size distribution gets weaker with the increase of engine load. Engine fueled with B5, B10, and B15 mainly exhausts low molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (ring number ≤ 4) which are closely related to unburned fuel, and the total PAH emissions are linear versus the fuel consumption. Toxicity equivalent (TE) of particles at low load is lower than that at intermediate load. DME–biodiesel blends with biodiesel mass proportion ≤ 15% can release the DME engine from abrasion and leakage, but no obvious increase in both particle emissions and the risk of particle toxicity. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The rapid growth of industrialisation has resulted in an ever-increasing demand for energy, with fossil fuels being an essential source of fuel for vehicles in the transport sector of countries. The world fossil fuel reserve is fast depleting, and also, it dissipates unhealthy emissions, this, has led to researches to seek sustainable alternatives in biofuels production. The authors experimented with the production of biodiesel from refined, bleached and deodorized palm olein (RBD) extracted from unrefined palm oil (UPO). Despite being considered as a feasible biodiesel feedstock, scanty reports had been found on the processing of biodiesel from palm olein compared to other oils from the palm tree. The transesterification of RBD palm olein with methanol and potassium hydroxide (KOH) as catalyst yielded biodiesel with an average yield greater than 50% in this experimental work. The derived biodiesel has a density of 0.884 g/ml and a flashpoint of 208°C, which is equivalent to ASTM D975 for biodiesel fuels. This result has proven this technique viable and will serve as a reference for continuous research on the biofuel production process. © 2020 SERSC.

AB  - In recent years, biodiesel has become more attractive as an alternative fuel for diesel engines because of its environmental benefits and the fact is that it is made from renewable resources. The role of biodiesel is not to replace petroleum diesel, biofuels help to improve the economical growth and positive impacts on the environment. The main purpose of this research is to reduce the emission such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOX), hydrocarbons (HC) and carbon dioxide (CO2). And to increase the performance characteristics such as break thermal efficiency (BTE), specific fuel consumption (SFC) of diesel engines. Here we used dual biofuel (lemongrass oil plus mint oil) blended with diesel and cerium oxide is added as an additive and undergone the test of engine performance and emission parameters of diesel. The measuring parameters are BTHE, specific fuel conception, CO2, CO, NOx and HC. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Purpose: In Pakistan, a major portion of population resides in rural areas that suffers severe energy shortage for agricultural and domestic need. Bio-digestion technology can play a significant role in the eradication of fuel energy shortage, given the socio-economic condition of rural communities. Despite of the efforts made by government organizations and NGOs for this technology promotion, it is still hampered by limited functionality and low rate of diffusion. Hence, this paper aimed at comprehensive systematic analysis to find out the underlying causes of slow technology dissemination. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the authors have analyzed the case of bio-digestion technology using the technological innovation system (TIS) approach. They have identified the barriers that effect the widespread technology diffusion followed by studying their impact on each of TIS functional element. Findings: The authors’ analysis points to the two main root causes which are lack of cohesive coordination between key stakeholders and poor functionality in legitimization, knowledge development and resource mobilization domain. Practical implications: This paper also provided implications for national policy makers and key stakeholders for the attainment of well-functioning innovation system for bio-digestion technology by removing the existing barriers. Originality/value: To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study that has incorporated the comprehensive framework of TIS in the context of Pakistan to explain the malfunctioning of innovation system that is hindering the technology adoption and dissemination. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - NOWADAYS, there is a great demand concerning searching about renewable energy sources. Therefore, wild plants such as Tamarix nilotica and Pluchea dioscoridis could be used as fossil fuel-alternative to meet the huge increments in the energy demand. The aerial parts of T. nilotica were collected from the Cairo-Suez road, while those of P. dioscoridis were collected from Wadi Hagul, Egypt. The biofuel generating compounds including lipids, carbohydrates, cellulose, pectin and lignin were assayed. The physico-chemical properties of the produced biodiesel were calculated. The obtained results indicated that, the high cellulose content (25.02%) of T. nilotica increases its potentiality for bioethanol production. The GC-MS analysis showed that P. dioscoridis displayed the highest levels of saturated fatty acid (SFAs) and a desirable degree of unsaturation (DU). The biodiesel properties in terms of iodine value (IV), saponification number (SN), cetane number (CN), oxidative stability (OS), high heating value (HHV), kinematic viscosity (η) and density (ρ) for both species were within the recommended standards and mostly met the criteria required to be a diesel substitute compared with the international biodiesel standards. Particularly biodiesel produced from P. dioscoridis has good and suitable engine parameters (SN 196.3, IV 76.81 and CN 114.18). © 2020 National Information and Documentation Center (NIDOC).

AB  - The aim of this study is to present the optimum operating conditions for reducing energy consumption in the process of obtaining bio-oil from the mixture of sawdust, waste lubricating oil, lime, and commercial catalyst. In the study where the catalytic pressureless depolymerisation (also called Katalytische Drucklose Verölung – KDV) was applied, the operating conditions were analysed with response surface methodology. According to the analysis of variance results, a mathematical model was obtained for specific product yield (bio-oil amount/energy consumption g kWe −1). Effects of temperature (260°C–290°C), catalyst rate (1–2 wt.%) and reaction time (0.5–1 h) were investigated. The optimum conditions for the three independent variables (temperature, catalyst rate, reaction time) were 279 ± 2°C, 2 wt.% and 0.5 h, respectively. Maximum specific product yield was obtained as 970.17 g kWe −1. While the reaction time was the most effective regarding the amount of bio-oil obtained at 1 kWe energy consumption, the temperature was found to be the least effective. In addition to these, bio-oil obtained under optimum conditions were characterised and compared with standard diesel specifications. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Solketal is a promising oxygenate additive that can be chemically derived from bioglycerol. Emulsification by a microwave-irradiating method was used to prepare the micro- and nanoemulsions of solketal dispersed in continuous ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) due to the immiscibility of solketal with ULSD. The emissions from a direct-injection, four-stroke and naturally aspirated diesel engine fueled with each of these emulsions, and with neat ULSD, were analyzed and compared. The experimental results show that the nanoemulsion and microemulsions were successfully produced. In addition, an increasing engine speed resulted in lower NOx, CO and O2 but higher CO2 emissions. The nanoemulsion was found to produce the lowest NOx emission while neat ULSD produced the highest NOx emission among these three test fuels. The lowest CO emission was formed by fueling the micro-emulsion of dispersed solketal-in-ULSD. Moreover, the burning of the nanoemulsion in the diesel engine formed the highest CO2 along with the lowest O2 emissions. Hence, the nanoemulsion had the highest burning efficiency among the three test fuels for the diesel engine. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The low-temperature oxidation (LTO) mechanisms of the 2-methylfuran (2-MF) biofuel and the corresponding thermodynamic and kinetic properties have been explored by density functional theory (DFT) and composite G4 methodologies as well as kinetic simulations. The O2 addition to the main furylCH2 radical from the methyl dehydrogenation in 2-MF forms three peroxide radicals PO1, PO2, and PO3 with the energy barriers of 15.1, 19.3, and 20.6 kcal mol-1 and the reaction ΔG of -8.2, 5.7, and -0.1 kcal mol-1 (298 K and 1 atm), respectively. Through hydrogen transfer followed by dehydroxylation, these nascent products evolve into stable aldehydes and cyclic ketones, which may further decompose into smaller species under the action of OH. Calculations and simulations show that the product P1 from the dehydroxylation of PO1 has a dominant population (higher than 96%) among the final products, although the temperature and pressure may influence the species profiles and rate constants to some extent. Based on the G4-calibrated thermodynamic parameters, the temperature and pressure dependence of the rate constants and the two- and three-parameter Arrhenius coefficients for all reactions considered here have been determined by using the transition state theory (TST) and Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) methods. The present results provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms and kinetics of the LTO process of the 2-MF biofuel. This journal is © the Owner Societies.

AB  - The negative impacts of fossil fuel on the environment should be replaced by clean and sustainable energy sources worldwide. Therefore, the use of biodiesel as a clean energy source is crucial. Biodiesel is produced from various natural resources through a transesterification process. Considering the importance of this topic, this study focuses on the assessment of oil properties of Thymelaea hirsuta and Echinops spinosus as primary sources for biodiesel production. The two investigated plants were collected from the Western Desert of Egypt. The results showed that the lignocellulosic content was about 57.3 and 79.8 g/100 g in E. spinosus and 59.1 and 82.8 g/100 g in T. hirsuta, respectively. The two investigated samples showed variable lipid contents (30.2-76.1%). The GC-MS fatty acid profile characterized seven FAs in E. spinosus and twelf FAs in T. hirsuta. The greatest CN was calculated in T. hirsuta (379.2) compared to the lowest in E. spinosus (229.9). Furthermore, the values of saponification number (SN) were 27.9 in E. spinosus and 16.07 in T. hirsuta. The value of higher heating value (HHV) was about 47.5 MJ/kg in E. spinosus and 48.3 MJ/kg in T. hirsuta. Meanwhile, T. hirsuta exhibited a higher induction period (IP) value (19.3 h) comparable to that of E. spinosus (4.3 h). The results revealed that both plants are potential sources for biodiesel production according to various international standards for biodiesel production, and this work appears to be one of the first reports regarding such wild xerophytic plants as promising new primary sources for biodiesel production in Egypt. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Abstract: In the search of hydrocarbon fuels derived from biomass, the increase in the chain length with the elimination of oxygenated species is a hard task. The simultaneous conversion of furfural and cyclopentanone to fuel range hydrocarbons has been investigated on a series of solid base catalysts. Furfural represents the family of sugars, typically obtained from the hemicellulose biomass fraction by different catalytic routes. Cyclopentanone can be readily obtained from the catalytic conversion of furfural via Piancatelli ring-rearrangement under reducing conditions. Aimed to enlarge the carbon chain length of these oxygenates, the aldol-condensation reaction between furfural and cyclopenanone was studied over MgAl mixed oxides, among which the MgAl-3 mixed oxide exhibited the best catalytic activity to produce C10–C14 oxygenates, a suitable range for transportation fuel precursors (C7–C15). After this C–C coupling reaction, the large oxygenates were successfully upgraded via hydrodeoxygenation on carbon-supported Ru and Pd nanoparticles to produce a mixture of linear alkanes and saturated cyclic hydrocarbons, which in practice would be direct drop-in components for transportation fuels. As an illustration of the potential implementation of this strategy for biofuel production, palm oil empty fruit bunches were experimentally evaluated using different acid pretreatments to extract the furfural, which was further employed to perform the aldol-condensation reactions. It was found that the proposed catalytic strategy is an environmentally-friendly route to add value to the palm oil industry wastes by producing value-added chemicals and fuel precursors.

AB  - Biofuels produced from non-food lignocellulosic feedstocks have the potential to replace a significant percentage of fossil fuels via high yield potential and suitability for cultivation on marginal lands. Commercialization of dedicated lignocellulosic crops into single biofuels, however, is hampered by conversion technology costs and decreasing oil prices. Integrated biorefinery approaches, where value-added chemicals are produced in conjunction with biofuels, offer significant potential towards overcoming this economic disadvantage. In this study, candidate lignocellulosic feedstocks were evaluated for their potential biomass and silica yields. Feedstock entries included pearl millet-napiergrass (“PMN”; Pennisetum glaucum [L.] R. Br. × P. purpureum Schumach.), napiergrass (P. purpureum Schumach.), annual sorghum (Sorghum bicolor [L.] Moench), pearl millet (P. glaucum [L.] R. Br.), perennial sorghum (Sorghum spp.), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea L.), giant miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus J.M. Greef and Deuter), and energy cane (Saccharum spp.). Replicated plots were planted at three locations and characterized for biomass yield, chemical composition including hemicellulose, cellulose, acid detergent lignin (ADL), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), crude protein (CP), and silica concentration. The PMN, napiergrass, energy cane, and sunn hemp had the highest biomass yields. They were superior candidates for ethanol production due to high cellulose and hemicellulose content. They also had high silica yield except for sunn hemp. Silica yield among feedstock entries ranged from 41 to 3249 kg ha−1. Based on high bioethanol and biosilica yield potential, PMN, napiergrass, and energy cane are the most promising biorefinery feedstock candidates for improving biofuel profitability. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The article outlines the current state of increasing consumption and demand for primary energy resources due to exhaustion and avalanche-like growth of their world prices. The effects of excessive use of non-renewable energy resources that have led to global climate change and deterioration of the natural environment are highlighted. The priority of sustainable development of the world energy sector is based on increasing consumption of renewable energy resources. The processes of the general world consumption of various types of primary energy and the dynamics of indicators of world bioethanol and biodiesel production during 2000-2018 are analysed. The forecast of consumption of the primary world energy and the production of liquid biofuels has been made for 2019-2025. The results indicate that the world market of bioethanol and biodiesel tends to expand, providing from an economic point of view rational use of energy resources, reducing gasoline and diesel consumption. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd..

AB  - Currently, the use of secondary agricultural raw material is a topical issue. There are various applications of agricultural crop residues possible, but they are finance- and energy-consuming. Burning crop residues is very harmful for the environment. One of the ways to solve the problem is the production of solid biofuel that can be used to heat buildings. The authors suggest producing solid biofuel in the form of small-sized fuel rolls / pellets (SFR), which are made of oleaginous flax residues. As a result of the conducted experimental investigations, the authors have proved the efficiency and the environmental safety of SFR consumption. The new fuel can be recommended if the requirement of efficient and ecologically safe combustion is met. Thus, the influence of small-sized fuel rolls’ properties on the process of their combustion as well as quantitative and qualitative analysis of the combustion gases from burning solid fuel made of oleaginous flax residues have been investigated. The paper presents the results proving that SFR combustion is the most efficient on condition of providing reduced moisture (10-12%) and reasonable density (80 kg/m3) in the process of pellet production. In addition, it has been determined that there is a significant reduction of harmful CO emissions and normalization of СО2 concentration. The application of the suggested solid biofuel can make it possible to solve the problem of using oleaginous flax residues and provide cheap fuel for household purposes. © 2020. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - In this research work, a surge tank is developed and utilised in the diesel engine for controlling the NOX emission. This surge tank acts as a damper for fluctuations caused by exhaust gases and also an intercooler in reducing the exhaust gas temperature into the diesel engine intake manifold. With the utilisation of the surge tank, the NOX emission level has been reduced to approximately 50%. The developed surge tank is proved to be effective in maintaining the circulation of water at appropriate temperatures.

AB  - Microalgae has emerged as a promising approach for removing substrate and nutrient from wastewater with the concomitant biofuel production. The substrate and nutrient removal are influenced by several factors such as C/N ratio, F/M ratio, pH, and DO. This study aims to determine the efficiency of substrate and nutrient removal with the growth rates of microalgae and biomass by varying the addition of aeration and substrate. Intermittently aerated reactors were used with the flow rate of 14 L/minute. The batch reactors were prepared by adding glucose substrate of 50 mg/L (Ra0A), 100 mg/L (Ra0B), and 150 mg/L (Ra0C) without aeration; 50 mg/L (Ra12A), 100 mg/L (Ra12B), and 150 mg/L (Ra12C) with 12-hour aeration, and 50 mg/L (Ra24A), 100 mg/L (Ra24B), and 150 mg/L (Ra24C) with 24-hour aeration. The substrate removal, expressed as chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the reactor with aeration, showed the efficiency of 73.88% ± 2.05 (12-hour aeration), 75.2% ± 3.97 (24hours aeration), and 69.86% ± 5.69(without aeration). Nutrient removal as ammonia-N (NH3-N) gave high removal value of 98.3% ± 0.11 and the removal of nutrient as phosphate (PO3-4) showed the efficiency of 54.3% ± 0.1. The growth rate of microalgae and biomass exhibited the highest value in Ra24C reactor with the values of 0.0229/day and 0.1295/day, respectively. The pH values indicated a shift from normal to alkaline while DO values increased by the addition of 12 and 24-hour aeration. © 2020 Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc..

AB  - The major source of fuel for compression ignition engine is diesel. Because of its non-renewable nature, unavailability, more pollution nature, importing charges of diesel is becoming costlier nowadays. So, there is a need for a new biofuel which is economical, renewable and gives better performance over diesel. In this proposed work, lemon peel oil is selected as an alternative fuel for diesel engine application because of its more extensive available nature, easy extraction process and equivalent calorific value as diesel with very low viscosity. Various fuel blends are prepared using lemon peel oil such as 10%, 20% and 30% on a volume basis and are tested in diesel engines. Test results indicate that significant reductions of engine tailpipe emissions for the 20% lemon peel biodiesel blend by 25%, 25.6% and 15.44% for the CO, HC and smoke, respectively, when compared to diesel. However, there is a slight increase in NOX emissions. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Biofuels are one of the largest sources of renewable and sustainable energy, which are made from organic matter or wastes. One of the main biofuels type are the biofuels that is derived from vegetable oils. Nowadays, biofuels are drawing more attention to global scientists because of the scarcity of mineral oil supplies. The primary objective of this analysis is to explore the influence of variability in ambient temperature on the ignition delay period and emission. The type of biodiesel fuel used is the Jatropha Biodiesel with three different blending ratio, which are J40, J30 and J40. The ambient temperature of constant volume chamber (CVC) Ti,cvc and combustion chamber (CC), Ti,cc, was varied from 750 K, 850 K, 950 K and 1100 K. In the form of the hydrocarbon (HC) pollution criterion, nitrogen oxide (NOx), carbon oxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2), the emission was studied. While the ignition delay was also studied with biodiesel blending ratio variation. The blending ratio of the biodiesel used were from 20% until 40%. The biodiesel used were algae, Jatropha and waste cooking oil. The finding reveals that the higher value of the ambient temperature mixture induces shorter ignition delay when the CVC and CC are coupled at different ambient temperatures. The emissions data obtained shows that the CO and HC component is lowered while the ambient temperature is higher but the volume of NOx rises. In the future, biofuels can be inferred as excellent fuel alternatives to replace diesel. © 2020 PENERBIT AKADEMIA BARU. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - India is the world's third largest consumer of energy. India's energy consumption consists of 44% coal, biomass and waste 24%, petroleum and other liquids 23% and other renewable sources such as wind, solar, nuclear and biofuels. Due to the shortage of diesel and increasing prices, biodiesel gained its importance as an alternate to the petroleum based fuels. This paper deals with the transesterification of waste cooking oil to biodiesel with copper doped zinc oxide nanocatalyst under varying parameters such as oil to methanol ratio (1:2-1:5 mol), catalyst loading (2-8% w/w), reaction time (30-60 minutes) and temperature (40-70°C). Results show that the maximum yield of about 97.7% was obtained at optimum reaction conditions. This result is further validated. The economic analysis of biodiesel production is carried out and the cost of biodiesel per litre works out to be 68 rupees INR ($0.99). © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this research work, analytical, experimental methods and monitoring techniques of bio-hydrogenated kerosene (BHK) production in continuous mode were presented. Two kinds of raw materials obtained from palm processing plant named as refined bleached deodorised palm oil (RPO) and palm kernel oil (PKO) were converted into BHK via hydrocracking reaction catalysed by Pd/Al2O3 catalyst in pilot scale. Firstly, both of RPO and PKO were pretreated by thermal technique. Subsequently, fatty acid compositions of palm oils were analysed by Gas Chromatography (GC). Then, hydrocracking reaction of RPO and PKO were separately conducted in continuous high pressure packed bed reactor (HPPBR). After reaction, crude-biofuel was refined into BHK via fractional distillation. In addition, some properties of BHK obtained from RPO/PKO such as were C, H, O elements, freezing point, flash points, total acid number and carbon distribution were analysed following the ASTM and UOP 915 standards. • Thermal pretreatment of refined bleached deoderised palm oil (RPO) and palm kernel oil (PKO). • Continuous hydrocracking reaction of palm oil was conducted in pilot scale. • Characterisation of bio-hydrogenated kerosene obtained from palm oil. © 2020

AB  - Most of the recent researches focus on alternative fuels because fossil petroleum resources reduce with time and also fossil fuels have the most adverse impact on environmental pollution. There are many researches that point out the importance of biodiesel fuel as an alternative to diesel fuel. The main objective of this work is to produce biodiesel from Chlorella vulgaris microalgae and utilize it through the high fuel injection pressure on a diesel engine in order to meet future emission legislation. Fuel injection pressure plays a significant job in atomization of injected Chlorella vulgaris biofuel and consent to for complete burning and tends reduce pollutants. The fuel injection pressure varies 22 to 42 MPa through CRDI fuel injection system. Based on the results, B25 Chlorella vulgaris fuel blend at 42 MPa of fuel injection pressure exhibits high thermal efficiency, better combustion and emission characteristics. © 2020 World Research Association.

AB  - Nigella sativa is one such plant species indigenous to Middle-east, Eastern Europe, and the Asian Subcontinent. Black cumin seeds derived from N. sativa are one of the identified biomasses to produce biodiesels for the use in an unmodified CI engine. The current study aims to evaluate the credibility of Nigella sativa methyl ester (NSME) as a suitable blend alongside mineral diesel in a common rail direct Injection engine via fundamental combustion analysis. In the present work, 20% of Nigella sativa methyl ester has been tested in diesel engine at 600 bar injection pressure under different pilot and main injection forms. The pilot injection mass has been varied from 5–15% along with variation in main injection also. An optimized injection strategy has been found with respect to performance and emissions for effective implementation of EGR at 10% and 20% rate. At 5% pilot injection, the NSME20 fuel showed comparable brake thermal efficiency and brake-specific fuel consumption at all engine loads. Furthermore, NOx emission of NSME20 fuel has been reduced by increasing the pilot injection rate when compared to diesel and this has been further reduced with 10–20% exhaust gas recirculation. On the other hand, the combustion characteristics of NSME20 blend also shown similar pattern like diesel fuel with slight reduction in cylinder pressure and heat release rate. Finally, it has been concluded that the newly developed Nigella sativa methyl ester can be used as sustainable biofuel for various energy applications in the present scenario.

AB  - Background: One of the most promising alternative biofuels, competitive with regular petrol, diesel or jet fuel is biodiesel, especially derived from plant oils. Until now, various technological approaches, as well as oil sources, have been proposed for biodiesel production, but an industrially scalable technology with high end-product quality and production efficiency has not been developed and brought to the market yet. Biodiesel is produced in Europe and North America mainly from rapeseed, or canola, sunflower and soybean oil. However, other underutilized plant species could also be considered as potential oil feedstocks for biodiesel. The great perspective holds Brassicaceae family, especially such species as false flax (Camelina sativa) and Ethiopian mustard (Brassica carinata), but many other Brassicaceae crops are still out of sight. Objectives: This research has been conducted aiming to identify and compare the productivity of several Brassicaceae crops (camelina or false flax (C. sativa), turnip rape (B. campestris), oil radish (Raphanus sativus var. oleifera) and tyfon (B. rapa ssp. oleifera f. biennis × (ssp. rapifera × ssp. pekinensis)), that are suitable for biodiesel production under conditions of temperate climate regions (Northern America, Europe); and to obtain biodiesel by transesterification of fatty acids present on these species using bioethanol. Methods and Materials: Seed oil content, yield and fatty acid profiles have been studied and analysed in different genotypes of C. sativa (10), winter (6) and spring (4) B. campestris, R. sativus var. oleifera (8) and tyfon (5). The most productive crops have been identified: false flax variety ‘Evro-12’ (1620 kg of oil per hectare) and ‘Peremoha’ (1657 kg/ha); winter turnip rape variety ‘Oriana’ (1373 kg/ha), oil radish variety ‘Kyianochka’ (1445 kg/ha) and tyfon varieties ‘Fitopal’ (1730 kg/ha) and ‘Obriy’ (1860 kg/ha). According to chromatographic analysis results, oils of winter turnip rape and tyfon contain high levels (38-42,8%) of erucic (22:1) acid, while oils from spring turnip rape, false flax and oil radish possess high amounts of short-chained fatty acids (not longer than C18) – up to 85,37% in camelina breeding line FEORZhYaFD. Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) were produced from oil of best genotypes and proved to comply with all main quality requirements for diesel. Results: Moreover, a new solvent-based technology of high-yield (up to 96%) FAEE production, has been firstly proposed for C. sativa oil conversion. Conclusion: Best genotypes that can be used as a plant oil source for biodiesel production have been identified for camelina, turnip rape, oil radish and tyfon species. The data obtained on seed oil content, yield and fatty acid profiles suggested that they are: false flax – breeding form FEORZhYaFD; winter turnip rape-variety ‘Oriana’; oil radish-variety ‘Rayduha’ and tyfon hybrid-variety ‘Fitopal’. Biodiesel samples obtained from these plants fit the Ukrainian standards for diesel fuel and can be used in car engines. The proposed new technological approach to produce fatty acid ethyl esters allows to reduce reaction time and to increase esters yield and quality. © 2020 Blume et al.

AB  - This purpose, zinc and nickel were chosen as the catalytic materials and Calophyllum inophyllum was chosen as the feedstock for biodiesel production. Experimental results proved maximum reduction of hydrocarbon emissions by 14.8%, carbon monoxide emissions by 21.89% and smoke opacity by 13.22% for nickel coated catalytic converter. However, carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides emission levels increased by 22% and 5.5%, respectively for nickel coated catalytic converter. On the other hand, zinc coated catalytic converter exhibited an increase of all emission levels except nitrogen oxides. The reduction level of nitrogen oxides with zinc coated catalytic converter was observed as 34.2%. Through this work it is revealed that nickel acts as an oxidative catalytic agent and zinc as the reducing catalyst in the catalytic converter. Copyright © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - In the present work, an alternative form of biofuel for the Compression Ignition (CI) Engine is generated from inedible disposable chicken skin and pig tallow. The collected resources are heated up to 80°C to extract fat and subjected to a trans-esterification process to obtain biofuel. The process resulted in 730ml and 950ml of high viscous biofuel from 1000ml of fat from waste chicken skin (WCS) and pig tallow (PT) respectively. The pure biofuels from WCS and PT have 38.07% and 41.68% higher viscous than diesel. The obtained biofuel is blended with diesel at 10, 20, and 30% by volume. The thermal, physical, and chemical properties of blended fuel are determined and found closer to the diesel properties. The engine tests indicate that the brake power of the B30 blend was decreased by 15.78% while the B10 combination produces 11.02% less power as compared to diesel at full load. The efficiency was reduced by 22.15, 7.59 % for B30, and B10 respectively at full load condition. About 3.9% and 34% of reduction in NOx, 22.5%, 27.5% of reduction in HC emission were recorded for respective blends at the same operating condition. This paper emphasizes on deriving value-added products from waste resources and its effective utilization. The findings from work indicate that the derived biofuel could be used in combination with diesel for the adequate partial replacement of diesel in CI engines without any significant alterations. © 2020 International Journal of Renewable Energy Research.

AB  - The catalytic activity of Co and Pd loaded on mordenite (MOR) was evaluated in the hydrotreatment of cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL) into biofuel. Metals were loaded into MOR as support via wet impregnation process. The Co content was varied as 2, 4, and 6 wt.% to produce Co(1)/MOR, Co(2)/MOR, Co(3)/MOR catalysts. The micro-mesoporous structures of the catalyst were confirmed by XRD, SEM, TEM, FTIR, and N2 adsorption-desorption measurement. AAS were used to analyze the amount of metal that is successfully loaded in the catalysts. Hydrotreating of the CNSL was conducted in a semi-batch reactor at 450 °C with hydrogen flow (20 mL/min) for 2 h. The liquid product was analyzed using GC-MS. The activity of Co/MOR was compared with the activity of Pd/MOR as a noble metal. The result of the hydrotreatment process showed a decrease of liquid product in the sequence of Co(3)/MOR &gt; Co(2)/MOR &gt; Pd/MOR &gt; Co(1)/MOR &gt; MOR. The Co(3)/MOR catalyst exhibited the highest conversion of liquid hydrocarbon than the others (61.8 wt.%), comprising predominantly by gasoline compounds with over 25.21 wt.% conversion. © Maya Tri Hapsari et al.

AB  - Nowadays, the production of liquid motor fuel faces such problems as compliance of the final product with existing international standards (for the content of sulfur, oxygen and nitrogen) as well as the improvement of the feasibility of the existing technologies for fuel production. Biomass is one of the most perspective and widely spread sources for energy. The existing techniques for biomass conversion into the fuels are mainly based on the hydroprocessing and can be successfully applied in petroleum industry. The integrated processes involving both biofuel and oil conversion are of great interest. In this work, the novel hydrogen-free approach for co-processing of heavy oil fractions and bio-oil is described. The use of supercritical solvent mixture, which includes propanol-2 and n-hexane, allows full substrate conversion to be achieved for maximum 3 h. As a result, the hydrocarbon mixture consisting of aromatic and cyclic compounds was obtained with 99 wt. % yield. © 2020, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - Fuel-like hydrocarbons (also known as biofuel) isolated from the deoxygenation of fatty acids present different advantages as compared with fossil fuels. In particular, the homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic deoxygenation methods have been the center of attention during recent years. Although catalytic deoxygenation of fatty acids via heterogeneous catalysis has been widely investigated, there is a high demand to review the progress in using the homogeneous catalysis pathways. Among the various homogeneous pathways, radical-based reactions and transition metal catalysis demonstrate the most promising results in the decarboxylation and decarbonylation processes. It is shown that radical-based reactions are more active in decarboxylation meanwhile the transition metal catalysts are rather selective to decarbonylation of fatty acids. Besides, the reaction conditions and type of catalysts are capable of enhancing biofuel production. Homogenous catalysis provides the huge potential for commercializing viability of biofuel via deoxygenation of fatty acids. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Non-edible fats are a common renewable feedstock for the biofuels production to avoid partially the use of edible feeds and fossil fuels. The aim of this work was the use of waste rendering fat to produce pyrolyzed and hydrogenated oils. The feedstock was hydrolyzed producing free fatty acids and glycerol + residues. The free fatty acids were pyrolyzed (with and without metal sulfides metal supported catalyst) or hydrotreated separately. An autoclave closed hermetically in nitrogen (pyrolysis) or hydrogen (hydrotreatment) atmosphere was used. Gaseous products were analyzed by GC-FID/TCD. Liquid products were analyzed by Simulated Distillation (ASTM D2887) and FT-IR (attenuated total reflectance technique). For the pyrolysis, the main gaseous products were carbon dioxide, methane, ethane, and propane. For the hydrotreatment, the total amount of gases produced was much lower being the main product the carbon dioxide. For liquids, the hydrotreatment of the free fatty acids produced the respective hydrocarbons by decarboxylation reaction and the pyrolysis produced a mixture of compounds with lighter boiling ranges compared to the original free fatty acids. The use of a metal sulfide metal supported catalyst in the pyrolysis led to a higher amount of hydrogen production. but similar boiling range liquid products compared to the non-catalytic test. © 2020 Atlantis Livros Ltda..

AB  - Green diesel, also known as renewable diesel, is a biofuel obtained from biomass with similar physical properties than petroleum diesel. Renewable diesel is mainly composed by hydrocarbons free of oxygen, which can be blended at high concentrations with petroleum diesel due to their chemical affinity. Density and viscosity are two important physical properties of fuels that play an important role in the processes of atomization and injection in engines. Also, the knowledge of these properties is important for the correct design, operation, and optimization of chemical processes. Despite their importance, there is low information about experimental data and developed models related to the renewable diesel–petroleum diesel blend. To overcome the above limitation, this paper is focused on the study of four blends of renewable diesel and petroleum diesel in order to study the variation of density and kinematic viscosity with respect to the concentration and temperature. In addition, empirical correlations to predict the density and kinematic viscosity as function of temperature and concentration were developed. Density and viscosity of renewable diesel, petroleum diesel, and their blends were simultaneously measured with a densitometer–viscometer device with an uncertainty in density and viscosity of 0.1 kg/m3 and 1 × 10−8 m2/s. The parameters of the developed correlations were adjusted by the Levenberg–Marquardt optimization method. There was a good agreement between the calculated and experimental data because an average absolute deviation (AAD) of 0.07 and 1.66% were obtained for the predictions of density and kinematic viscosity respectively. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Recent developments in internal combustion engines have heightened the need for alternative biofuel. In the last five years, acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) has been extensively studied as a promising biofuel. However, the detailed investigation of its fuel properties has not been performed. One of the vital fuel properties is the cetane index. It is used to define the ignition quality of fuel, but its determination is painstaking and expensive. No previous study has utilized both empirical mathematical and ANN models to predict the cetane index of ABE-diesel blends. This study aims to predict ABE’s cetane index by comparing five empirical mathematical models with seven artificial neural networks (ANN) training algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the cetane index of ABE-diesel blends using both empirical and ANN models. Results revealed that the feed-forward backpropagation network with 4 input, 10 hidden, and 1 output neurons that was trained with Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (ANN-LM) showed the best performance with the highest values of R (0.9992) and R2 (0.9984). It also has the lowest values of MAD, MSE, RMSE and MAPE at 0.2572, 0.4456, 0.6675, and 0.5304, respectively. As compared to the best empirical mathematical model (the 3rd order polynomial), the ANN-LM had slightly better performance accuracy. Therefore, the 4–10-1 ANN structure trained with Levenberg-Marquardt was found to be the best predictor for cetane index of ABE-diesel blends at various blending ratios. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Increase in the unrefined petroleum cost and the spike in interest for raw petroleum in the non-oil creating nations compel them to look for an elective wellspring of fuel to utilize. It has been discovered that the Biodiesel acquired from vegetable oils mixed with diesel can work in the compression ignition engine with no change up to certain volumetric structures. Mustard oil obtained from the plants of Brassica juncea was used to produce biodiesel by trans-esterification strategy. The readied mustard oil biofuel was mixed with diesel in the proportion of 5%, 10%, and 15% and included with Al2O3 nanoparticles as an added substance. The readied tests were tried at a consistent speed Compression Ignition Engine at different loads and compared for emission with that of diesel. It has been found from the outcomes that the carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC), and smoke exhaust diminished and the nitrogen oxides (NOX) outflows expanded with an expansion in the mix. The oxygen content in the mix is the explanation behind the improvement of the ignition procedure and the decrease of the HC, CO, and smoke exhaust. Further a 12% decrease in the NOX emission was achieved with the assistance of the 10% of exhaust gas recirculation. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Consuming countries are increasingly holding transnational businesses accountable for environmental damage on behalf of affected communities in exporting countries. The EU Renewable Energy Directives (RED) and the EU Timber Regulation (EUTR) particularly demonstrate such an accountability-by-proxy. Both aim to prevent worldwide deforestation. However, their design and accountability logics vary considerably. Using the case of Indonesia, the article addresses the question of whether a certain accountability relationship matters for improving outcomes such as prevention of tropical deforestation. Hereby, the article contributes to a new theoretical understanding of how logics of proxy accountability are linked to narratives about agency and what inherent normative risks are. The article shows that, different from the EUTR narrative, which reaffirms standard accountability arrangements, RED presents a hybrid approach. This hybrid approach may more effectively prevent tropical deforestation, but it comes at the price of further marginalization of directly affected communities. © 2020, Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - From last two decades, research in the field of alternative, clean and renewable bio-fuels has been increased dramatically for performance improvement, emission control, and running cost reduction in internal combustion engines due to the continuous increase of fuel pricing and depletion of the available nonrenewable fuels. In the present study, mixture of diethyl ether and nitromethane is proposed as a bio-fuel to evaluate the feasibility of diesel-diethyl ether-nitromethane (D-DEE-NM) ternary blends as compared to pure diesel. For the experiments, a VCR diesel engine was used to determine the performance and emission characteristics of D-DEE-NM ternary fuel blends at different concentrations, loads, and compression ratios. In the first phase of experiments, D-DEE7.5-NM2.5 blend (diesel 90%, diethyl ether 7.5 %, nitromethane 2.5 %) was observed as best fuel at standard engine parameters. The improvement in engine performance (BTE increased 17.39% and BSFC decreased 19.44%) and emission reduction (smoke 27.94%, NO x 23.33%, and CO 28.57%) was noticed using D-DEE7.5-NM2.5 blend as compared to pure diesel at full load condition; however, slight increment (3.57%) was found in HC emission. Further, the experiments were performed using selected blend (D-DEE7.5-NM2.5) at different compression ratios (CR), in which CR 19.5 was found best among all CRs under existing engine conditions. By increasing CR from 18.5 (standard) to 19.5, improvement in engine performance (3.70% increment in BTE and 6.89% decrement in BSFC) and emission reduction (smoke 12.24%, CO 20.00%, and HC 65.51%) were found using D-DEE7.5-NM2.5 blend; however, slightly higher level of NO x with tolerable increment of 6.52% was observed. D-DEE7.5-NM2.5 fuel blend was also found economic as compared to pure diesel. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The transesterified corn oil, as a biofuel over Direct Injection (DI) single-cylinder, four-stroke diesel engine, has been studied in this research. The Compression Ratio (CR) on performance parameters when fuelled with 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% blends with diesel (on volume basis) is investigated and compared with that of Diesel (B0). Experiments were conducted at a constant speed with maximum load and a compression ratio of 17:1, 18:1 and 19:1. The conclusion revealed that specific fuel consumption is lower and brake thermal efficiency is higher for blend B60 at compression ratio 19:1 when compared to B0. The volatile emissions dropped with CR 17:1 and slightly increased for higher CR of Carbon Monoxide, Carbon Dioxide and Hydro Carbon, besides the decrement of Oxides of Nitrogen. B60 as a fuel at compression ratio 19:1 and maximum load condition is found to show better results than B0 as a fuel. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Petroleum has been the most consumed energy source in the world, but it tends to run out due its non-renewable character. Among biofuels, biodiesel has emerged as the main candidate to substitute petroleum diesel. The present study aimed to identify the maximum yield point of biodiesel production by generating a response surface using molar ratio, temperature and agitation time as independent variables, and yield as a dependent variable. From the response surface, it is observed that the increase in temperature and reaction time leads to reduced yield. The configuration that resulted in maximum yield of 93.30% was 12:1 molar ratio, 30 °C temperature and 30-minute reaction time. From the chromatographic analysis it was possible to identify five different fatty acids in the composition of the biodiesels. Total saturated fatty acids (palmitic and stearic acids) ranged from 41.53% to 42.09% and total unsaturated fatty acids including monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids (oleic, linoleic and linolenic acids) ranged from 57.92% to 58.48%. According to the results of the physicochemical analyses, the specific mass at 68°F is in agreement with Brazilian, American and European specifications, ranging from 877.46 kg m-3 to 879.64 kg m-3. The kinematic viscosity at 104 °F ranged from 4.49 mm² s-1 to 4.82 mm² s-1. The acid value obtained did not vary within the limits established by the norms, and values between 0.54 and 2.74 mg KOH g-1 were observed. © 2020, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool. All rights reserved.

AB  - Alternative propulsion fuels for diesel engines were highlights for a variety of research activities within a large number of R&D labs in the world. Curiosity, as well as basic interest in alternative fuel has been immense because of its reproducibility, renewability, as well as good ecological characteristics. Another reason for this interest is a favorable impact on the economies of the countries engaged in their production, by processing that kind of bio fuel. This paper presents the results of testing and research of the three types of alternative fuel gained from bio oil. Analyses and comparison of the dynamics of combustion process of these alternative fuels were done in relation to the reference diesel fuel. Burning process of methyl esters rapeseed (RME100), soya oil (SME100), waste cooking palm oil (PME100), as well as of regular euro diesel fuel were investigated. It was found that these fuels were highly usable in diesel engines if they had been produced according to a proper standard procedure under standard EN 14214. The application of bio fuel is also very interesting for the propulsion of agricultural engines and machinery, because it enables the individual farming of bio fuel products necessary for the appropriate own machinery. © Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Belgrade..

AB  - Purpose is to predict potentially hazardous effects of diesel vehicles of mining enterprises on the environment and to minimize the environmental risks caused by these impacts by modifying motor fuels with special additives. Methods. Method of mathematical modeling, implemented within the MathCAD environment, was used for assessment of the increase of environmental load on the roadside territories and human health caused by emissions of pollutants from exhaust gases of heavy diesel vehicles (HDV) of mining enterprises. The data, concerning potential emissions of the most hazardous pollutants from the exhaust gases of HDVs, has been generalized both by own field observations and by the analysis of scientific literary sources. The load on the environment by the analyzed pollutants has been corrected taking into consideration the share of heavy diesel vehicles engaged in cargo carriages by means of pendular routes of mining enterprises. Findings. Increased level of the environmental risk, resulted from operation of heavy diesel vehicles and other types of special- purpose diesel machines, has been identified. It has been proposed to apply a method of physical and chemical control of the motor fuel by adding multifunctional fuel composition (i.e. additive) containing both surface-active and antioxidant complexes. It has been determined that the use of the developed additive decreases substantially the load on the environment, in particular, on the roadway – by 26-29% for nitrogen oxides and by 39-41% for particulate matter (PM). The abovementioned mitigates environmental risks as well as the impact of heavy diesel vehicles on the human health. The substantial reduction of the distances, within which safe concentration levels of the analyzed pollutants can be observed, has been achieved. Originality. It has been identified that the diesel fuel modification by the developed additive makes it possible to solve a problem of local and diffuse pollution of a roadside space resulted from HDV emissions. It has been proved that the use of the fuel composition decreases toxic level of exhaust gases of diesel motors and reduces fuel consumption while improving the fuel burning conditions as well as air-fuel mixture forming. Practical implications. The obtained results may be applied to improve ecological safety level of the roadside territories and to minimize the ecological risks resulted from HDVs of mining enterprises for the environment and human health. © 2020.

AB  - Preparation of biodiesel using in situ transesterification has been extensively conducted for agricultural, microbial and algal biomass, while few works have been performed using aquatic animal tissue. In this work, fish processing wastes were collected to perform in situ transesterification using grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) biomass as a representative with which to optimize the reaction conditions. Under the optimum condition, the highest biodiesel purity reached up to 100% for sea bass wastes, which is higher than the 96.5% specified in the EN 14214-2008. The in situ method proposed here has the potential to save significant costs in biodiesel production compared to conventional methods, which usually require high-cost pretreatment of the raw materials. Additionally, the waste residue byproduct produced has a high protein content, and therefore the potential to be used for high-protein feed. This study is expected to inspire new strategies to prepare biodiesel and high-protein feed simultaneously from aquatic animal biomass using the novel in situ transesterification. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The integration of microalgal cultivation in wastewater can fulfill the dual roles of pollutant degradation and biomass output. Meanwhile, the LED lights with different wavelengths have a great effect on the growth and metabolism of microalgae. In this study, Golenkinia SDEC-16, a strain isolated for biofuel production, was evaluated to verify its potentials for campus sewage treatment and lipid accumulation under the red, green, and blue lights. The results indicated that the treated campus sewage met the first grade level in the Chinese pollutant discharge standards for municipal wastewater treatment plants within seven days under both red and blue light. The green light failed to exhibit excellent performance in nutrient removal, but facilitated the lipid synthesis as high as 42.99 ± 3.48%. The increased lipid content was achieved along with low biomass accumulation owing to low effective light utilization, indicating that the green light could be merely used as a stimulus strategy. The red light benefited the photosynthesis of Golenkinia SDEC-16, with the maximal biomass concentration of 0.80 ± 0.03 g/L and lipid content of 36.90 ± 3.62%, which can attain the optimal balance between biomass production and lipid synthesis. © 2020 Changliang Nie et al.

AB  - Environmental concerns caused by the constant use of fossil fuels can be solved by the use of biofuels. This work shows the application of the oil of Trichilia emetica Vahl (Mafura) seeds originating from Mozambique as a feedstock for biodiesel production. The high oil acidity required a two-step reaction involving esterification using sulphuric acid (H2SO4) as catalyst followed by for the conversion of Mafura oil to fatty acid methyl ester (FAME). The acid value was reduced from 27.58 to 0.36 (mg KOH g−1). Other physicochemical properties (moisture content, density, free glycerol) of FAME attended the established limits of EN14214 and Brazilian norms. The low induction-period (IP) was surpassed after the addition of 500 ppm of the synthetic antioxidant tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) resulting in 10.8 h. The conversion of the feedstock (99.1%wt) was confirmed by gas chromatograph with flame ionization detector (GC-FID). The fatty-acid methyl ester contents of the Mafura biodiesel presented palmitic acid (39.32%wt), linoleic acid (31.09%wt), oleic acid (25.77%wt), stearic acid (2.29%wt), meristic acid (0.78%wt), linolenic acid (0.61%wt) and lauric acid (0.14%wt). These results show that the biodiesel produced from Mafura oil met most of the quality standards required by American, Brazilian and European regulatory agencies. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This paper evaluates internal combustion engine performance parameters (Specific Fuel Consumption and engine torque) and pollutant emissions (O2, CO, and NOX), and also, provide an assessment of economic viability for operation in Amazonas state. Power supply to the communities in the Amazon region has as characteristics high costs for energy generation and low fare. Extractive activities include plenty of oily plant species, with potential use as biofuel for ICE (Diesel cycle) to obtain power generation together with pollutant emission reduction in comparison to fossil fuel. Experimental tests were carried out with five fuel blends (crude palm oil) and diesel, at constant angular speed (2,500 RPM – stationary regime), and four nominal engine loads (0%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) in a test bench dynamometer for an engine-driven generator for electrical-power, 4-Stroke internal combustion engine, Diesel cycle. Main conclusions are: a) SFC and torque are at the same order of magnitude for PO-00 (diesel) and PO-xx at BHP50/75/100%; b) O2 emissions show consistent decreasing behavior as BHP increases, compatible to a rich air-fuel ratio (λ > 1) and, at the same BHP condition, O2 (%) is slightly lower for higher PO-xx content; c) The CO emissions for PO-00 consistently decrease while the BHP increases, as for PO-xx those values present a non-linear behavior; at BHP75%-100_loads, CO emissions are higher for PO-20 and PO-25 in comparison to PO-00; d) The overall trend for NOX emissions is to increase, the higher the BHP; In general, NOx emissions are lower for PO-xx in comparison to PO-00, except for PO-10 which presents slightly higher values than PO-00 for all BHP range; e) Assessment on-trend costs indicates that using palm oil blends for Diesel engine-driven generators in the Amazon region is economically feasible, with an appropriate recommendation for a rated power higher than 800 kW. © 2020, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

AB  - This paper proposes a system dynamics model to study and analyse interactions among the variables of bioethanol and biodiesel supply chains. The proposed model is used for constructing scenarios to investigate appropriate policy options and their possible future effects on the market share of bioethanol and biodiesel in the USA. In order to increase bioethanol and biodiesel market shares and creating a reasonable balance between them, a scenario-based sensitivity analysis is conducted. The results of sensitivity analysis demonstrate that causing an increase in oil plant and biodiesel production and a decrease in corn and bioethanol production results in an increase in both bioethanol and biodiesel market shares as well as a fair balance between them. Policy implications related to increasing biofuel production in the USA are also provided. Additionally, for validating the proposed model, behaviour reproduction test is done.

AB  - The search for a balance between the energy-related challenges of the future and providing nutritional security has resulted in the development of a market for biofuels of successive generations. The larger their portion in biofuel production, the less the prices of agricultural products will increase. The use of algae, cyanobacteria and aquatic plants in the production of liquid fuels is an alternative. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of thermal hydrolysis on degradation of polysaccharides contained in biomass of cyanobacteria Arthrospira platensis and to assess the effectiveness of ethanol production from preconditioned biomass. The study is aimed at the selection of the most advantageous parameters of thermochemical hydrolysis to reach the experiment variant with the best effects, degree of polysaccharide degradation and effectiveness of alcohol fermentation. The experiment was divided into two stages; in stage I, the possibility of obtaining fermentable sugars by hydrothermal and chemical treatment of the substrate was tested. Stage II involved an assessment of the effectiveness of the pretreatment methods to produce bioethanol in alcohol fermentation. Yeast used in industrial ethanol production—Saccharomyces cerevisiae As4—was used in the alcohol fermentation. The results have shown that the temperature of 150 °C was the most beneficial for the process of thermohydrolysis, and the mash in the microwave-heated sample contained the highest concentration of alcohol (0.97 g/l), which is 98% more than in the control mash and 37% more than in the conventionally heated sample. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Mesoporous silica nanoflowers bearing -NH2 groups were synthesized by the hydrolysis of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) with reverse microemulsion method, following with the grafting of -NH2 groups by the post modification with (3-Aminopropyl) trimethoxysilane (APTMS). The lipase from C. antarctica was immobilized on the as-synthesized amino-grafted mesoporous silica nanoflowers to fabricate the lipase-immobilized mesoporous silica nanoflowers composite, which was applied for the catalytic transformation of biomass-derived levulinic acid to biofuel ethyl levulinate (EL), and exhibited excellent catalytic activity. An ethyl levulinate yield as high as 99.5% could be achieved at 40 °C in 8 h reaction time, which was much higher than that catalyzed by the free lipase (67.9%) under the identical conditions. The immobilized lipase showed good stability and recyclability that ethyl levulinate yields above 68% could be remained after seven recycle times. This work represents a novel strategy to construct the immobilized biocatalyst for the production of bio-based chemicals. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A systematic approach for advanced soft sensor development was applied to predict free fatty acid (FFA) content from NIR spectra under real plant conditions, namely in process streams from a biofuel producing unit integrating raw materials with time-varying complex matrices (e.g., wasted cooking oils, WCOs). The proposed methodology systematically screened through 52 combinations of preprocessing and inferential modeling methods, including current state of the art predictive methodologies, and the recently proposed multiresolution soft sensors. The model's prediction capabilities were compared through a rigorous framework based on Monte Carlo double cross-validation and statistical hypothesis testing. This study used 119 samples with FFA content in the range of 0.1030% to 5.6740%. The best model is based on the novel multiresolution soft sensor framework. This model had a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9792 and a prediction root mean squared error of 0.1187 (13.6% lower than the best model based on standard modelling methodologies). The proposed approach can be easily replicated to other scenarios where soft sensors based on Process Analytical Technology (PAT) are to be developed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - People from rural areas face some limitations to reach sustainable development, such as the lack of electricity. In this work, we propose a multi-objective nonlinear programming model to find the optimal design and operation of water, energy, and food systems for agricultural communities. To this aim, we develop, using a bottom-up approach, a mathematical formulation of a superstructure that includes renewable power technologies, water management devices, and food and energy crops. Numerical experiments are carried out using data from a community in Michoacan, Mexico. The results from the sensitivity analyses show that selling bioethanol as an economic activity can be attractive for this community by slightly increasing the biofuel price and the sugarcane yield. Moreover, the epsilon-constraint method, along with a Pareto filter, is applied to obtain compromised solutions. Some of these solutions represent a significant improvement in social and environmental dimensions while maintaining an acceptable economic index. These results show this methodology's usefulness for analyzing economic opportunities and obtaining strategies to manage the Water-Energy-Food Nexus (WEFN), especially the land distribution between food and energy crops. The model proposed constitutes a contribution, as a decision-making tool, to the sustainable development of rural communities. © 2020

AB  - The main objective of this work is to contribute to a gradual replacement process of fossil diesel (D) with biofuels composed by diethyl carbonate (DEC) and either sunflower or castor oil, as straight vegetable oils (SVOs). DEC is a very interesting candidate as an oxygenated additive not only because of its low price and renewable nature, but also its favorable fuel properties, such as very low kinematic viscosity, high cetane number, high oxygen content, rich cold flow properties and good miscibility with fossil diesel and vegetable oils. In this work, the more suitable DEC/SVO biofuels are chosen based on kinematic viscosity, according to the European normative. Additionally, the most relevant physical-chemical properties of (bio)fuels such as density, calorific value, cloud point, pour point and cetane number are determined. The influence of DEC on engine performance and exhaust emissions is analyzed by fueling a conventional Diesel engine with the different D/DEC/SVO triple and DEC/SVO double mixtures. The tests results are also compared with commercial diesel. From the results, it is concluded that Diesel engine fueled with the blends studied exhibits an excellent performance in terms of power output, very similar to diesel. Additionally, the use of these blends can remarkably decrease smoke emissions down to 98%, with respect to fossil diesel. The addition of DEC shows a significant improvement in cold flow properties of fuel mixtures in the exchange of a slightly higher brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) than diesel. Interestingly, the pure biofuels composed by DEC and SVO allow for a suitable engine operation and achieve the lowest emissions, which means these blends can be successfully employed in current engines without adding fossil diesel, i.e., their use entail a 100% renewability. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - This paper presents the results of applying ennobled solid biomass via mechanical compaction or torrefaction as fuel for ships, in terms of fire safety, environmental protection, the increase in liquid fuel prices and the dwindling resources of crude oil. The object of investigation is a ship of the ro-pax ferry type, with low cruising range, which is intended for service on the Baltic Sea. The ship's power system is discussed and the results of calculations of the thermal cycle for a steam turbine power plant are presented. We present a simplified comparative analysis of a fuel bunker for a ship with a power plant including biomass fired boilers, and for a ship with a conventional solution of a motor power plant supplied by ultra-low sulphur fuel originating from crude oil. The advantages of applying a fluidised bed biomass fired boiler are highlighted, and selected results from tests of this boiler are presented. In addition, we assess potential fire hazards on the ship resulting from the storage and transport of pellets, and from pellets after torrefaction. © 2020 Wojciech Zeńczak et al., published by Sciendo 2020.

AB  - Increasing the use of renewable energy sources is one of the most important goals of energy policies in several countries to build a sustainable energy future. This contribution proposes the synthesis of a biorefinery supply network for a case study of the European Union (EU-27) under several scenarios based on a mathematical programming approach. Several biomass and waste sources, such as grains, waste oils, and lignocellulosics, are proposed to be utilized, and various biofuels including first, second, and third generations are produced such as bioethanol, green gasoline, biodiesel, Fischer Tropsch (FT) diesel, and hydrogen. The aim of this study is to evaluate the capabilities of EU-27 countries to be able to meet the Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) target regarding the share of renewable energy in the transport sector by 2030 in each Member State while not compromising the current production of food. A generic mathematical model has been developed for the multi-period optimization of a biorefinery supply network with the objective of maximizing sustainability profit. The solutions obtained show that biomass and waste are promising raw materials to reach and go beyond the EU’s renewable energy target in the transport sector for the year 2030. However, some countries would need to provide additional subsidies for their companies to achieve at least a non-negative economic performance of biofuel production. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Cobalt and/or Molybdenum based catalysts were simply dispersed on γ-Al2O3 through wet impregnation. The set of prepared monometallic and bimetallic catalysts of aCoO/γ-Al2O3, aMoO/γ-Al2O3, aCoOaMoO/γ-Al2O3, and bCoObMoO/γ-Al2O3 were investigated and evaluated in the hydrocracking of Calophyllum inophyllum (CIO) which is not a food crop as well as rich in unsaturated fatty acid that potential to be converted into biofuel. Out of the prepared catalysts, aCoOaMoO/γ-Al2O3 with total metal content, acidity, and specific surface area of 13.62 wt%, 5.01 mmol.g-1, and 107.67 m2.g-1, respectively, showed the best catalytic performance. The high metal loading of aCoOaMoO/γ-Al2O3 is favorable by producing 65.56 wt% liquid fraction through carbocation formation mechanism. It was selective to produce 8.61 wt% gasoline and 5.01 wt% diesel. Copyright © 2020 BCREC Group. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: To meet the present transportation demands and solve food versus fuel issue, microbial lipid-derived biofuels are gaining attention worldwide. This study is focussed on high-throughput screening of oleaginous yeast by microwave-aided Nile red spectrofluorimetry and exploring pongamia shell hydrolysate (PSH) as a feedstock for lipid production using novel oleaginous yeast Rhodotorula pacifica INDKK. Results: A new oleaginous yeast R. pacifica INDKK was identified and selected for microbial lipid production. R. pacifica INDKK produced maximum 12.8 ± 0.66 g/L of dry cell weight and 6.78 ± 0.4 g/L of lipid titre after 120 h of growth, showed high tolerance to pre-treatment-derived inhibitors such as 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (5-HMF), (2 g/L), furfural (0.5 g/L) and acetic acid (0.5 g/L), and ability to assimilate C3, C5 and C6 sugars. Interestingly, R. pacifica INDKK showed higher lipid accumulation when grown in alkali-treated saccharified PSH (AS-PSH) (0.058 ± 0.006 g/L/h) as compared to acid-treated detoxified PSH (AD-PSH) (0.037 ± 0.006 g/L/h) and YNB medium (0.055 ± 0.003 g/L/h). The major fatty acid constituents are oleic, palmitic, linoleic and linolenic acids with an estimated cetane number (CN) of about 56.7, indicating the good quality of fuel. Conclusion: These results suggested that PSH and R. pacifica INDKK could be considered as potential feedstock for sustainable biodiesel production. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - In the present work, biodiesel esters were produced by enzymatic reaction of Palm Fatty Acid Distillate (PFAD) with ethanol using a dry fermented solid (DFS) with lipase activity obtained by Solid-State Fermentation (SSF) in palm cake and fiber in an integrated process. The DFS humidity showed to have a great influence on the productivities and ester yields. PFAD conversion of 75 % was obtained in esterification reaction with a molar ratio of 1:1 (hydrous ethanol: PFAD), 8.65 U/g DFS at 50 °C after 6 h, similar to the attained with Lipozyme RM IM although the reaction rate (g consumed FFA.h−1.g biocatalyst−1) was higher using the commercial lipase. The process was possible to be scaled-up at least 16 times for SSF and 50 times for the reaction, and the biocatalyst production process was reduced from 10 to 8 days. Biocatalyst washing before its reuse removed more than 90 % of the medium adsorbed on the DFS which improved the biocatalyst reuse. The biocatalyst was also able to convert palm oil into ethyl esters with an ester yield of 59 % obtained in a molar ratio ethanol: palm oil of 3:1, 8.7 U/g DFS at 45 °C in 72 h. A preliminary economic assessment of DFS production costs considering a projected capacity of 100 t.year−1, and 7% interest, showed a minimum selling price of 25 $. kg−1 to obtain positive Net Present Value. Even Lipozyme RM IM presenting a better efficiency, the non-commercial biocatalyst presented a better productivity / price (16 g consumed FFA.h−1.g biocatalyst−1.$−1) while for Lipozyme RM IM this value was 12 (g consumed FFA. h−1.g biocatalyst−1.$−1). Further optimizations in SSF process could improve even more the enzyme production yield (enzyme activity/g of material). © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biofuels such as ethanol have been used in internal combustion engines to reduce polluting emissions. However, some studies show that they affect engine performance due to their differences in thermophysical properties. Besides, pure ethanol has not been properly evaluated in compression ignition engines. Therefore, this work shows the results of an exergy analysis in a single cylinder compression ignition engine converted to spark ignition engine of varying compression ratio, operated with diesel, ethanol, and gasoline/ethanol blends, in different operating parameters. Tests were carried out on the engine without modifications operating diesel at a compression ratio of 17:1 and converted to spark ignition with 50%, 10% gasoline/ethanol blends and pure ethanol at compression ratios of 9:1, 12:1 at rotation speeds of 1500, 2100, 2600 and 3200 rpm. Under the experimental operating conditions, the results of the modified engine showed that the blend 50% and ethanol performs better by operating with 12:1 compression ratio, in relation to exergetic efficiency and environmental effect factor. Besides, the engine showed a better performance by becoming to spark ignition operating with ethanol and gasoline/ethanol blends. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bioenergy could play an important role for Japan's long-term mitigation strategy and energy supply but understanding of Japan's domestic bioenergy supply capacity is limited. Here, we estimated Japan's technical and economically feasible bioenergy potential throughout this century. We used an integrated assessment framework covering various feedstocks, with a gridded high-resolution land-use model and consideration of changes in population and cropland demand. Our results suggest that Japan's total technical bioenergy could be 3.43 EJ/year to 3.78 EJ/year in the 21st century—17.3%–19.1% of the country's current primary energy supply. Among feedstocks, dedicated bioenergy crops would be the greatest contributors, supplying 1.34 EJ/year in 2050 and 1.61 EJ/year in 2100, owing to the increasing availability of abandoned land. Cost analysis revealed that about half the technical potential of land-based feedstocks could be produced at 5 USD/GJ. Potential maps showed that land-based biomass supply was located mainly in northeast, central, and southern Japan. Our assessment suggests that the bioenergy contribution to Japan's energy supply and CO2 emission reduction could be larger than previously expected. Unlike under the current import-oriented development strategy, Japan's domestic feedstock supply could be self-sufficient. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Crude oil extracted from tilapia heads and oils obtained from different steps of its refinement process (physically degummed, chemically degummed, neutralized, and bleached oils) were used as raw materials for biodiesel production. Extraction and refinement of the oil and, after, production and economic viability of the different biodiesels were performed. The heads corresponded to 45% of waste from Nile tilapia and of extractions yield was around 80–85% of the crude oil. The highest biodiesel yields were with the neutralized oil (80.35%, w w−1) and chemically bleached oil (83.55%, w w−1). The lowest biodiesel production costs were by the physical degumming, chemical degumming, and neutralization steps, which presented an average cost of 0.181 US$ kg−1. Neutralized oil in the transesterification reaction, besides presenting the lowest biodiesel production cost, provided a suitable product with the acid value, kinematic viscosity, and flash point according to ASTM standard for biodiesel. Regardless of the refinement process, the degradation ranges of the oil samples were 350–550 °C. TLC, GC, and FTIR confirmed the triglycerides conversion from tilapia oil into biodiesel. Based on results, Nile tilapia neutralized oil showed suitable characteristics, becoming a promising source for biodiesel production of the quality and economically viable. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Acetone-n–butanol-ethanol (ABE) has proven to be a promising biofuel rather than n–butanol. Although the detailed and semi-detailed oxidation mechanisms of ABE were proposed, they were not suitable in combustion model with an acceptable timescale. Therefore, a skeletal mechanism for ABE/diesel blends combustion was developed hierarchically with the special emphasis on engine-relevant operating conditions using a decoupling methodology. It composes of 82 species and 247 reactions conformed to the combustion characteristics of nine components which are acetone, n–butanol, ethanol, ABE, diesel and four diesel surrogates including methylcyclohexane, iso–octane, toluene and n–decane. The compact-sized mechanism was benefited from acetone, n-butanol, ethanol and diesel surrogates sharing the same detailed core sub-mechanism, and their extremely simplified fuel-related sub-mechanisms. The mechanism was then fully validated against ignition delay, laminar flame speed, premixed flame species profile, and direct injection compression ignition engine combustion. The results show that the measured combustion behavior in experiments are well reproduced, indicating the current mechanism can be reliably applied to predict the ABE/diesel blends combustion in practical engines. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Considered as a promising source of sustainable energy, biofuel produced from algae holds many advantages. However, to truly understand the production process and assess the potential for further optimization, a novel analytical technique is needed. Comprehensive multiphase (CMP)-NMR is introduced as a potentially powerful tool for the biofuel industry. CMP-NMR combines all aspects of solution and solid-state NMR into a single probe, permitting the detection and differentiation of liquids, gels, and solids in intact multiphase samples. Here, algal biomass is subjected to subcritical water extraction, where the effects of feedstock species, reaction temperatures, and the presence of a catalyst are investigated. The distribution of organic components (i.e., lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins) across phases (liquid, gel, and solid) under various reaction conditions provides the understanding required to further optimize both targeted and nontargeted extraction processes. This provides the basis to not only increase the efficiency of the main fuel-related products but also understand the useful "byproducts", such as animal feed from the protein-rich solid residue. The goal of this study is to act as a proof-of-concept, demonstrating the considerable potential of CMP-NMR to monitor and understand biofuel-related processes at the molecular level. ©

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of microalgae for biofuel production is suffering from low bio-oil yield and high heteroatomic compositions owing to their low efficiency and selectivity to hydrolysis of cellular compounds. Hereby we report Keggin-type (Mo−V−P) heteropolyacids (HPAs)-catalyzed HTL of microalgae for efficient low-nitrogen biocrude production. The increases of reaction temperature, reaction time, and vanadium substitution degrees of HPAs are favorable to biocrude yield initially, whereas a significant decrease of biocrude yield is observed owing to the enhanced oxidation of carbohydrates above the optimum reaction conditions. The maximum biocrude yield of HPAs-catalyzed HTL of microalgae is 29.95 % at reaction temperature of 300 °C, reaction time of 2 h, and 5 wt% of HPA-4, which is about 19.66 % higher than that of control with 71.17 % less N-containing compounds, including 1,3-propanediamine, 1-pentanamine, and 2, 2’-heptamethylene-di-2-imidazoline than that of control. This work reveals that HPAs with Brønsted acidity and reversible redox properties are capable of both enhancing biocrude production via catalyzing the hydrolysis of cellular compounds and reducing their nitrogen content through avoiding the Maillard reactions between the intermediates of hydrolysis of carbohydrates and proteins. HPAs-catalyzed HTL is an efficient strategy to produce low N-containing biofuels, possibly paving the way of their direct use in modern motors. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - Triglycerides from animal fats and vegetable oils are used as the sustainable feedstocks for the generation of biofuels. Tung oil, rubber seed oil, Jatropha curcas oil, waste cooking oil, and waste acidified oil were selected as the triglyceride feedstocks for the production of drop-in biofuels by a catalytic cracking process. The one-step process was carried out in a laboratory-scale fixed-bed reactor using a SO42-/TiO2-ZrO2 catalyst. The catalyst exhibited an excellent performance of cracking, deoxygenation, and aromatization reactions. Moreover, it could be repeatedly used for more than 15 times without an obvious deactivation. The catalytic cracking process resulted in a high yield (65-72%) of the biofuel, which showed a low acid value (3.78 mg KOH/g) and low oxygen content (1.49%). The biofuels were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, elemental analysis, proton nuclear magnetic resonance, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, suggesting that the dominant components of the biofuels are hydrocarbons in the range of C6-C26, including 17% alkanes, 56% olefins, and 22% monocyclic aromatics. These bio-hydrocarbon fuels in the crude form are chemically identical or near-identical to petroleum-based fuels, which have an attractive fraction distribution (>32% bio-gasoline, >50% green diesel, and <11% heavy fraction) and can be fractionated and used in different formulations depending on the types of desired fuels. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biobutanol is a highly competitive alternative biofuel for fossil fuels in the future. However, there is no consensus on the soot formation of the four butanol isomers. The soot formation characteristics of the pure n-heptane (B00) and the volumetric mixture 50% n-heptane/50% butanol isomer (H50B50) flames were investigated on a coflow burner. The quantitative soot volume fraction, qualitative OH radical concentration, morphological parameters and nanostructures of soot particles were measured by the two-color laser induced incandescence (TC-LII) method, the planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) method, and transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis. Compared with B00 flame, the soot loading of n-heptane/n-butanol (N50), n-heptane/s-butanol (S50) and n-heptane/i-butanol (I50) flames decreased by 62%, 40% and 33%, respectively, whereas the n-heptane/t-butanol (T50) flame increased by 57%. The oxidation of soot particles was jointly affected by the region and the peak concentration of OH radical. As the flame developed, the primary particle diameter initially increased and then decreased in the order T50 > I50 > S50 > N50. Regarding soot nanostructure, the fringe tortuosity and inter-fringe spacing of soot sampled in the three flames decreased in the order I50 > S50 > T50. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the current research, MgO/MFS nanocatalyst was used in the transesterification process to produce green fuel from vegetable oil. The effect of various synthesis methods such as precipitation, hydrothermal, conventional combustion, and microwave combustion on the magnesium ferrite nanostructure support was investigated. MgO active phase was then impregnated on the support. Synthesized nanocatalysts were characterized by BET-BJH, FTIR, XRD FESEM, and EDX-Dot mapping techniques, and the best performance was staged by the combustion method while the microwave synthesized sample is slightly more active. This catalyst had fine pore size distribution, sheet-like morphology, appropriate roughness (4.6 nm) in the range of 500 nm, and the highest specific surface area (140 m2/g), which 95.4 % of sunflower seed oil was converted to FAMEs. This nanocatalyst was also more stable in the successive reaction conditions than the conventionally combustion synthesized sample which shows the superiority of this heating method in combustion synthesis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Pool fires are the most common form of fire scenarios which can occur with liquid biofuels. The detailed measurement of fire characteristics and safety distances from such fires are therefore essential for ensuring safety of people, infrastructure and environment. In the present work, characteristics such as Mass Burning Rate (MBR), fire length, fire temperature, Surface Emissive Power (SEP) and safety distance of two biofuels i.e. WCO (Waste Cooking Oil) biodiesel and ethanol pool fires are measured for five pool diameters (d = 0.05 m, 0.1 m, 0.2 m, 0.5 m and 1 m). In order to develop a range of uncertainties present data are compared with the earlier published data. The mass burning rate (depending on diameter) of both biofuels are measured to be 1.3–4.6 times smaller than gasoline because of the smaller heat flux back to the liquid pool which was confirmed from their lesser flame temperature. Due to the effect of cross-wind (3–4 m/s) at d = 1 m, smaller increase in burning rate was measured for ethanol than biodiesel which was otherwise higher for all other diameters where experiments were conducted in controlled environment. As a result shorter flames and small flame temperature are measured which led SEP of both biofuels to be comparable with each other and lie in the range of 10–20 kW/m2(d⩽1) m which is considerably less (1.8–3.7 times) than their equivalent gasoline fires. The measured thermal safety distances are also 2–3 times smaller than gasoline. Correlations are developed in terms of the pool diameters as per the standards prescribed by EN1473 and NFPA 49 CFR which can be utilized in land use planning for WCO biodiesel and ethanol storage tanks. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Isopropanol-butanol-ethanol (IBE) is a clean and renewable biofuel, but its component ratio effects on the spray combustion process of diesel have not been reported to date. In this study, IBE mixtures with different component ratios (6:3:1, 3:6:1 and 0:10:0) were separately blended into diesel at the volumetric ratio of 20% and then tested in a constant volume chamber. The experimental results show that isopropanol in IBE plays leading role on the spray combustion characteristics of IBE/diesel blends; the more isopropanol in the IBE blend, the shorter the liquid penetration is. Furthermore, the IBE/diesel blends containing more isopropanol always exhibit a long ignition delay but a short combustion duration. Results also show that regardless of whatever type of IBE/diesel blends, the flame lift-off length (FLOL) prolongs and the spatial integrated natural flame luminosity (SINL) reduces. However, the magnitudes of reduction of the SINL for the IBE/diesel blends vary with the component ratio of IBE. The IBE/diesel blends containing more isopropanol always present a noticeably lower SINL. Compared with pure diesel, the fuel blends containing more isopropanol are capable of reducing the time integrated natural luminosity (TINL) almost by half in most test conditions. That is to say, increasing isopropanol ratio in IBE can reduce the soot formation of IBE/diesel blends but the increase of the butanol ratio has an opposing trend. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Growing energy needs and medium‐term weakening of fossil energy reserves are driving forces towards the exploitation of alternative and renewable energy sources, such as biofuels from energy crops. In recent years, Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz has been rediscovered and is gaining popularity worldwide. The present work reports the results of a study on the life cycle, from cradle‐to‐gate, of C. sativa oil as a raw material for the production of biofuels in northern Italy, considering two scenarios, namely, the production of biodiesel (BD) and the extraction of pure vegetable oil (PVO). The functional unit was 1 megajoule of biofuel. A life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) was calculated according to the ILCD2011 procedure. Focusing on the global warming potential, the PVO scenario performs better than the BD scenario, with around 30 g CO2eq MJ−1. The net energy ratio (NER) exceeds unity for BD (approximately 1.4) or PVO (approximately 2.5). The same general trend was recorded for all calculated LCIA indicators; the common evidence is a generalized worse performance of the BD scenario, with indicators always scoring higher than the PVO. In particular, the two human toxicity indicators—carcinogenic and fresh water—eutrophication represent a significant difference, attributable to the refining process. Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses, respectively, underline the generalized importance of agricultural performances in the field and of allocation choices. Specifically, the importance of the grain yield and seed oil content in determining the environmental performance of the two scenarios was evident. As far as allocation is concerned, mass allocation provides the most favorable results, while on the other hand, the expansion of the system was the most penalizing alternative. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Thailand has been implementing its Alternative Energy Development Plan aiming to replace 20–25% of fossil fuels with locally produced biofuels by 2036. The partial substitution of fossil diesel with fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) derived from palm oil is one of the major options but blending beyond 20% of FAME is a concern for use in conventional diesel engines. This problem has led to the consideration of other bio-based diesels also derived from palm oil; namely, partially hydrogenated fatty acid methyl ester (H-FAME) and bio-hydrogenated diesel (BHD). This study performed a comparative life cycle assessment of various bio-based diesels using the ReCiPe life cycle impact assessment method. The results showed that in comparison to fossil diesel, bio-based diesels have superior performance for global warming and fossil resource scarcity, but an inferior performance for eutrophication, terrestrial acidification, human toxicity, and land use. Considering the collective environmental damages, BHD performed the worst for human health, and all the bio-based diesels showed poor performance for ecosystem quality, while diesel showed poor performance for resource availability. Among the bio-based diesel products, BHD has higher environmental burdens than FAME and H-FAME. Improvements have been suggested to enhance the environmental performance of the bio-based diesels. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - A series of mesoporous composites of SO42−/Al-Zr/KIT-6, with varied ratios of ZrO2 to Al2O3 and degrees of sulfation have been synthesized as an efficient, clean, facile and environmental-friendly nano-catalyst for the selective etherification of biomass-derived 5 hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to produce 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF) as a biofuel candidate in a one pot process. Structure/property relationships of the catalyst have been determined and optimized in terms of EMF yield and HMF conversion. The resulting catalyst has been further tuned through tailored reaction conditions to produce an EMF yield of 89.8 % and HMF conversion of 99 %. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper is aimed at performing an environmental evaluation regarding biofuel production. The process combines four sections: biomass fast pyrolysis to bio-oil with two phases, oil-phase upgrading by hydrotreating, using H2 obtained by steam reforming, and a new process to produce Fischer-Tropsch biofuels from supercritical water reforming of the aqueous phase. This phase can be valorised in the latter process entirely so natural gas is reformed to H2 (case-study 1), or partially so a fraction of this aqueous phase is reformed (case-study 2), or all this phase is reformed to H2 (case-study 3). The two former can include CO2 storage and aqueous phase concentrations were 15, 25 and 35 wt% organic compounds. At 25 wt%, the global warming potential is 11 g CO2-eq/MJ-biofuel for the case 2 with CO2 storage, while it was 11.3, 12.6, 27.7 and 34 g CO2-eq/MJ-biofuel for the cases 3, 2 without CO2 storage, 1 with and without CO2 storage, respectively. Thus, the case-study 2 with CO2 storage gives the minimum global warming potential, allowing significant reductions with respect to the use of fossil fuels. For the other categories, the case-study1 presents the lowest impacts. Similar trends are found at 15 and 35 wt%. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is considered as a valuable and less toxic alternative to diesel. However, cellular and molecular effects of repeated exposure to biodiesel emissions from a recent engine equipped with a diesel particle filter (DPF) remain to be characterized. To gain insights about this point, the lung transcriptional signatures were analyzed for rats (n = 6 per group) exposed to filtered air, 30% rapeseed biodiesel (B30) blend or reference diesel (RF0), upstream and downstream a DPF, for 3 weeks (3 h/day, 5 days/week). Genomic analysis revealed a modest regulation of gene expression level (lower than a 2-fold) by both fuels and a higher number of genes regulated downstream the DPF than upstream, in response to either RF0 or to B30 exhaust emissions. The presence of DPF was found to notably impact the lung gene signature of rats exposed to B30. The number of genes regulated in common by both fuels was low, which is likely due to differences in concentrations of regulated pollutants in exhausts, notably for compound organic volatiles, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, NO or NOx. Nevertheless, we have identified some pathways that were activated for both exhaust emissions, such as integrin-, IGF-1- and Rac-signaling pathways, likely reflecting the effects of gas phase products. By contrast, some canonical pathways relative to “oxidative phosphorylation” and “mitochondrial dysfunction” appear as specific to B30 exhaust emission; the repression of transcripts of mitochondrial respiratory chain in lung of rats exposed to B30 downstream of DPF supports the perturbation of mitochondria function. This study done with a recent diesel engine (compliant with the European IV emission standard) and commercially-available fuels reveals that the diesel blend composition and the presence of an after treatment system may modify lung gene signature of rats repeatedly exposed to exhaust emissions, however in a rather modest manner. The lung gene signatures of rat exposed repeatedly to diesel and biodiesel vary with the diesel composition, the presence of a diesel particle filter and support modest lung adverse effects. © 2020

AB  - This work studied the hydrothermal liquefaction of Chlorella pyrenoidosa and effect of emulsification on upgrading the bio-oil. The fuel properties and storage stability characteristics of emulsion fuels were explored. The combustion characteristic analysis showed that the ignition temperatures of emulsion fuels (139.6–151.3 °C) were lower than that of bio-oil (176.9 °C). Besides, emulsion fuels had higher comprehensive combustion indexes (7.24–14.08 × 10−6 × min−2 × C−3) than bio-oil (1.51 × 10−6 × min−2 × C−3), indicating that emulsion fuels had better combustion performance. The kinetic analysis showed that emulsification could effectively reduce the activation energy, resulting in less energy input for combustion. Based on chemical composition evolution during the storage process, a possible stability mechanism was proposed. The storage stability analysis indicated that the diesel-solvable fractions in bio-oil had better stability. Overall, this work provides a feasible way for bio-oil upgrading through emulsification. In addition, a better understanding of the stability property of emulsion fuel was provided. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present research describes an application of high-pressure briquetting technology to the waste management of sugarcane processing in Vietnam. The amount of generated sugarcane bagasse was monitored during sugarcane processing within the street juice production in Hue city, Vietnam. Generated sugarcane bagasse was subjected to fuel parameters analysis within its suitability for direct combustion. The obtained sugarcane bagasse was converted into bio-briquette fuel by a high-pressure briquetting press and its mechanical quality was determined. Results proved that the proportion of generated sugarcane bagasse from whole sugarcane stem mass was equal to 35.45%. This indicated generation of an abundant amount of sugarcane bagasse worldwide in general. Fuel parameters analysis proved high quality level of low ash content = 0.97% and high calorific values (gross calorific value = 18.35 MJ·kg-1, net calorific value = 17.06 MJ·kg-1), which indicated good suitability for direct combustion processes. Indicators of mechanical quality proved the following observations: mechanical durability = 99.29%, compressive strength = 150.82 N∙mm-1 and bulk density = 1022.44 kg·m-3, with all these indicators representing positive results. In general, the observed results indicated suitability of sugarcane bagasse valorization within the production of bio-briquette fuel by using high-pressure briquetting technology. Finally, analysis of such waste biomass proved its great potential for energy recovery, thus, the advantage of its valorization within the sustainable technologies. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - In this study, the central composite design of response surface methodology was employed as a design of an experiment to optimize the extraction of oil from Maesopsis eminii seeds using ultrasonic-assisted solvent extraction (UASE). The most appropriate values of operating variables such as extraction time and n-hexane to biomass ratio and its effects on oil yield were analyzed. The 7:1 n-hexane-to-biomass ratio (140 mL n-hexane/20 g seed powder) and the 20 min extraction time were found as optimum conditions to get an oil yield of 47.86 ± 0.09 %. Oil's chemical characteristics and compositions include yellowish color, 0.90 g/mL density, 5.40 pH, 47.9 mm2/s kinematic viscosity, 39.63 MJ/kg high heating value, &gt;200 °C flashpoint, and 0.36 ± 0.05 % free fatty acid content. The analyses of Fourier Transform Infrared Radiation (FTIR) and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrophotometry (GC–MS) revealed that oil from the M. eminii seeds has esters and looked-for fatty acids signifying its potential for biodiesel production. Major fatty acids include oleic (36.7 %), linoleic (24.3 %) and stearic (22.6 %) with minor components shared by palmitic (10.2 %), arachidic (2.6 %), y-linolenic (1.5 %), cis-11-eicosenoic (1.5 %) and behenic (0.5 %). The exploratory oil refining via UASE and transesterification resulted in 84.6 % biodiesel yield indicating its high conversion rate and demonstrating its potential as a feedstock for green diesel production. Hence, the coming of the liquid biofuel from the unexplored non-edible M. eminii seeds would benefit humanity and the environment as this would reduce the use of petroleum-based fuels that are known for producing much air pollution in the atmosphere. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A major obstacle to biodiesel commercialization is supplying feedback which increases production costs. The potential of some oleaginous yeast for conversion of waste materials to biodiesel feedstock can overcome this problem. In this study, a potential oleaginous yeast strain was used for single-cell oil (SCO) production. Two sets of experiments were designed for the optimization process. According to the results obtained from the first experiment, lipid production and lipid content of this strain increased from 1.96 g/L and 22.6% to 3.85 g/L and 35.18% by optimization of grass hydrolysis, respectively. The results of the second experiment indicate an increase in SCO production and lipid content to 7.28 g/L and 56.39%, respectively. These results were obtained when HNO3 was used for substrate pre-treatment. Lipid analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry showed a suitable and high potential of fatty acid profile for biodiesel production, which was then confirmed by evaluating the physicochemical properties of the biodiesel obtained in compliance with the US and EU standards. Consumption of microbial oil and low-cost substrate can compensate the high costs of feedstock in biodiesel production. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Computer simulations are used to study the production of renewable diesel through the biochemical transformation of biomass sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] to free fatty acids using a genetically modified strain of Escherichia Coli. We evaluate select environmental and economic metrics using life cycle assessment (LCA) and techno-economic analysis (TEA). The biofuel supply chain includes feedstock production, handling, pretreatment and hydrolysis, fermentation to free fatty acids, saponification of the free fatty acids, wax production on an electrochemical synthesis reactor, and hydrocracking to convert the wax to renewable diesel. The TEA model developed uses experimental data from pretreatment to wax synthesis steps and literature for the conversion of wax to diesel. The TEA model is integrated into a life cycle inventory model to estimate life cycle greenhouse gas and non-renewable energy consumption. Considering both environmental and economic factors we find that the performance of this pathway to produce renewable diesel returns lower product yield, higher cost, and higher GHG and energy impacts compared to biomass-to-ethanol pathways, primarily due to poor process yields (mainly fermentation). This limitation in the metabolic pathway constrains the maximum yield potential of FFA and therefore renewable diesel and other potential co-products from biomass derived sugars. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Abstract: The use of raw materials from renewable sources has become an important topic for different industries. Pine oleoresin is one of the most important renewable sources. It is composed of a broad range of chemical substances from volatile molecules to complex compounds. The resinic fraction, known as rosin or colophony, comprises approximately 80% of oleoresin. This fraction has become the most attractive one from the economic standpoint. Rosin is a complex mixture of diterpenic acids and is typically used in formulation of adhesives, coating materials, rubbers, printing inks, among others. Although their transformations have been studied, scarce information on the thermal and thermochemical properties of rosin and rosin-derived products has been reported. In this work some of these properties have been estimated to evaluate the influence of chemical transformations such as reduction, isomerization and esterification of rosin components. The estimations have been compared to the literature data and to some experimental values. The interest of some of these transformations is based on the reduction in melting and boiling temperatures observed, although such reductions are probably not enough to use these substances as fuel components.

AB  - India meets 80% of its crude oil demands through imports. India has 17.84% of the global human population; however, it has only 2.4% of global surface area, and about 30% of primary energy consumption. Conventional energy reserves are dwindling, and there has been intensive research to find alternatives to fossil fuels. Considering the looming energy challenges, Indian policy makers have taken multiple strategic steps to incorporate renewable energy into India's energy systems. This paper focuses on the Ethanol Blending Programme, and evaluates various sectors and scenarios (across the value chain) to assess the country's preparedness and capacities to meet the blending target. Results show that, under given market conditions, India can achieve only 3% blending, although the target was 20% ethanol blending by 2017. Additionally, challenges and weak linkages across the value chain were identified and actions to fast-track programme execution were made. If the recommendations are realized India can achieve the blending target in the coming years. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - It has been proven that vehicle emissions such as oxides of nitrogen (NOx) are negatively affecting the health of human beings as well as the environment. In addition, it was recently highlighted that air pollution may result in people being more vulnerable to the deadly COVID-19 virus. The use of biofuels such as E5 and E10 as alternatives of gasoline fuel have been recommended by different researchers. In this paper, the impacts of port injection of water to a spark ignition engine fueled by gasoline, E5 and E10 on its performance and NOx production have been investigated. The experimental work was undertaken using a KIA Cerato engine and the results were used to validate an AVL BOOST model. To develop the numerical analysis, design of experiment (DOE) method was employed. The results showed that by increasing the ethanol fraction in gasoline/ethanol blend, the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) improved between 2.3% and 4.5%. However, the level of NOx increased between 22% to 48%. With port injection of water up to 8%, there was up to 1% increase in engine power whereas NOx and BSFC were reduced by 8% and 1%, respectively. The impacts of simultaneous changing of the start of combustion (SOC) and water injection rate on engine power and NOx production was also investigated. It was found that the NOx concentration is very sensitive to SOC variation. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Long-term poplar phytoremediation data are lacking, especially for ecosystem services throughout rotations. We tested for rotation-age differences in biomass productivity and carbon storage of clones Populus deltoides Bartr. ex Marsh × P. nigra L. ‘DN34′ and P. nigra × P. maximowiczii A. Henry ‘NM6′ grown for landfill phytoremediation in Rhinelander, WI, USA (45.6◦ N, 89.4◦ W). We evaluated tree height and diameter, carbon isotope discrimination (∆), and phytoaccumulation and phytoextraction of carbon, nitrogen, and inorganic pollutants in leaves, boles, and branches. We measured specific gravity and fiber composition, and determined biofuels recalcitrance of the Rhinelander landfill trees versus these genotypes that were grown for biomass production on an agricultural site in Escanaba, MI, USA (45.8◦ N, 87.2◦ W). ‘NM6′ exhibited 3.4 times greater biomass productivity and carbon storage than ‘DN34′, yet both of the clones had similar ∆, which differed for tree age rather than genotype. Phytoaccumulation and phytoextraction were clone-and tissue-specific. ‘DN34′ generally had higher pollutant concentrations. Across contaminants, stand-level mean annual uptake was 28 to 657% greater for ‘NM6′, which indicated its phytoremediation superiority. Site-related factors (not genotypic effects) governed bioconversion potential. Rhinelander phytoremediation trees exhibited 15% greater lignin than Escanaba biomass trees, contributing to 46% lower glucose yield for Rhinelander trees. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Nowadays, maritime air pollution is regarded as a severe threat to coastal communities' health. Therefore, many policies to reduce air pollution have been established worldwide. Moreover, there has been a shift in policy and research attention from greenhouse gases, especially CO2, to other air pollutants. To address the current local environmental challenges, this research analyzes the non-greenhouse gas emissions inventory (CO, NOx, SOx, PM, VOC, and NH3) from ships in the second biggest port in Korea, the Port of Incheon (POI). A bottom-up activity-based methodology with real-time vessel activity data produced by the Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) is applied to obtain reliable estimations. NOx and SOx dominated the amount of emission emitted from ships. Tankers, general cargo ships, cruise ships, and container ships were identified as the highest sources of pollution. Based on the above results, this study discusses the need for long-term policies, such as the designation of a local emission control area (ECA) and the establishment of an emission management platform to reduce ship-source emissions. Furthermore, this study elucidates that significant emissions come from the docking process, ranging from 33.9% to 42.0% depending on the type of pollutant when only the auxiliary engines were being operated. Therefore, short-term solutions like applying exhausted gas cleaning systems, using on-shore power supplies, reducing docking time, or using greener alternative fuels (e.g., liquefied natural gas or biofuels) should be applied and motivated at the POI. These timely results could be useful for air quality management decision-making processes for local port operators and public agencies. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Microalgae are potential feedstock for biofuels due to higher heating value and rapid growth rate. It can be cultivated in sewage, avoiding costs associated with clean water and nutrients, making the possibility of energy generation from wastewater treatment plants appealing. Compact microgeneration systems involving biomass gasifiers are already commercialized for small-scale projects and could be adapted for use with microalgae in wastewater. In this study, an experimental investigation of a commercial downdraft gasifier was conducted using microalgae produced in a wastewater treatment plants. The effects of the air-fuel equivalence ratio on syngas composition, higher heating value, and production rates were evaluated. An increasing and then decreasing trend in equivalence ratio with a peak was observed, indicating that the optimum equivalence ratio for the best performance is 0.23. The cold gas efficiency was 87%, higher heating value was 6.2 MJ/Nm3, and the production rate was 2.8 Nm3/kg dry biomass. The syngas composition was 11.9% H2, 19.5% CO, 8.5% CxHy, and 9.8% CO2. The H2/CO ratio observed in the syngas was 0.61, which is very close to the 0.60 recommended for synthetic fuel production (Fischer-Tropsch gasoline and diesel). © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Climate change is currently affecting both biodiversity and human activities; land use change and greenhouse gas emissions are the main drivers. Many agricultural services are affected by the change, which in turn reflects on the basic provisioning services, which supply food, fibre and biofuels. Biofuels are getting increasing interest because of their sustainability potential. Jatropha curcas gained popularity as a biodiesel crop, due to its ease of cultivation even in harsh environmental conditions. Notwithstanding its high economic importance, few studies are available about its co-occurrence with pests of the genus Aphthona in sub-Saharan Africa, where these insects feed on J. curcas, leading to relevant economic losses. Using ecological niche modelling and GIS post-modelling analyses, we infer the current and future suitable territories for both these taxa, delineating areas where J. curcas cultivations may occur without suffering the presence of Aphthona, in the context of future climate and land use changing. We introduce an area-normalized index, the ‘Potential-Actual Cultivation Index’, to better depict the ratio between the suitable areas shared both by the crop and its pest, and the number of actual cultivations, in a target country. Moreover, we find high economic losses (~−50%) both in terms of carbon sequestration and in biodiesel production when J. curcas co-occur with the Aphthona cookei species group. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - This work assessed the effects of biodiesel on carbonyl emissions from diesel trucks. Biodiesel converted from waste cooking oil was employed and mixed with commercial fossil diesel to produce four blends: B0 (pure conventional diesel fuel), B5 (5% v/v biodiesel), B20 (20% v/v biodiesel) and B100 (pure biodiesel). Four diesel trucks were tested under real-world conditions using a portable emissions measurement system, including one China III light-duty diesel truck (LDDT), one China IV LDDT, one China III heavy-duty diesel truck (HDDT) and one China IV HDDT. A driving cycle including highway (HW) and non-highway (NHW) driving conditions was employed and carbonyls were sampled using 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine cartridges and analyzed via high performance liquid chromatography. Seven carbonyl compounds were detected, and formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone and butyraldehyde were the primary carbonyls. Total carbonyl emissions from the China III LDDT, China III HDDT and China IV HDDT vehicles with selective catalytic reduction decreased monotonically with increases in the biodiesel proportion, while the China IV LDDT with a particle oxidation catalyst system showed an increasing trend. With increases in the biodiesel proportions, complementary variations were observed in the proportions of formaldehyde and butyraldehyde obtained using the China III LDDT, China IV LDDT and China III HDDT vehicles. However, in the case of the China IV HDDT trials, the formaldehyde and acetaldehyde emissions exhibited complementary variations. Under different driving conditions, the effects of adding biodiesel on carbonyl emission factors were different. In China III LDDT trials, biodiesel reduced carbonyl emissions to a greater extent under HW conditions, but the opposite occurred in China III HDDT tests. Using the China IV LDDT vehicle, the emission factors did not increase as much during HW trials compared with NHW trials when the B5 and B20 fuels were used, but were significantly higher than the NHW values when pure biodiesel was employed. In China III LDDT data, the proportions of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and butyraldehyde showed opposite variations under the two driving conditions. Using the China IV LDDT vehicle, a significant increase in formaldehyde and decrease in butyraldehyde were found during HW trials, but not NHW trials. Ozone formation potentials were obtained from carbonyls emission factors using the maximum incremental reactivity method and their variations were similar to those of the carbonyl emission factors. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper quantitatively investigates the return transmission, volatility spillovers, dynamic correlations, and financial risks between corn, soybean, and crude oil futures and US and European equities. Specifically, by applying our newly extended quinquevariate dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) system with asymmetric spillovers and skew-t errors, we obtain the following new evidence. First, during our recent sample period, the nexuses and dynamic interactions between corn, soybean, and crude oil futures and US and European equities have tightened. Second, we find strong return transmission from US equities to corn, soybean, and crude oil futures and European equities. Third, we clarify significant volatility spillovers that are tied to the leverage effect, from US and European equities to corn and crude oil futures, indicating that downside risk in equity markets is important when considering volatility spillovers to fuel and energy markets. Using the conditional variances and covariances from our new system, we further derive more precise time-varying optimal hedge ratios and optimal portfolio weights. These newly find that for the three asset classes of biofuel crops, crude oil, and equities, hedging one asset class with the other asset classes is effective, and well-balanced portfolios constructed using the three asset classes are optimal. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A 246 species and 1062 reactions containing skeletal n-dodecane/n-butanol/NOx/Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) combustion mechanism (Mix246) was developed for n-dodecane/n-butanol blend combustion under diesel engine-like conditions. The Mix246 mechanism was validated using ignition delay and species concentration profile data from various n-dodecane and n-butanol combustion experiments as well as by comparisons with predictions from the parent mechanisms. Subsequently, the Mix246 mechanism was coupled with a 3D Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) solver to simulate turbulent combustion of n-butanol/n-dodecane blended sprays in a constant volume combustor using an unsteady flamelet model. The CFD model for the 100% n-dodecane case was benchmarked against the non-reacting and reacting Spray-A conditions of the Engine Combustion Network (ECN). Finally, a parametric study was conducted to investigate the effects of various diesel engine-like conditions such as fuel injection pressure, initial ambient pressure and temperature conditions and varying n-butanol/n-dodecane blend ratios on NOx and soot emissions. Simulations show that the turbulent spray combustion evolves through distinct temporal stages and that the fully developed flame have spatially separated zones of reactive physics. Combustion properties and emission profiles for pure n-dodecane and blends with up to 20% n-butanol were seen to be nearly identical suggesting that n-butanol is a suitable alternative biofuel for CI engine combustion. © 2020 Energy Institute

AB  - Cyanobacteria, the largest phylum of prokaryotes, perform oxygenic photosynthesis and are regarded as the ancestors of the plant chloroplast and the purveyors of the oxygen and biomass that shaped the biosphere. Nowadays, cyanobacteria are attracting a growing interest in being able to use solar energy, H2O, CO2 and minerals to produce biotechnologically interesting chemicals. This often requires the introduction and expression of heterologous genes encoding the enzymes that are not present in natural cyanobacteria. However, only a handful of model strains with a well-established genetic system are being studied so far, leaving the vast biodiversity of cyanobacteria poorly understood and exploited. In this study, we focused on the robust unicellular cyanobacterium Cyanothece PCC 7425 that has many interesting attributes, such as large cell size; capacity to fix atmospheric nitrogen (under anaerobiosis) and to grow not only on nitrate but also on urea (a frequent pollutant) as the sole nitrogen source; capacity to form CO2-sequestrating intracellular calcium carbonate granules and to produce various biotechnologically interesting products. We demonstrate for the first time that RSF1010-derived plasmid vectors can be used for promoter analysis, as well as constitutive or temperature-controlled overproduction of proteins and analysis of their sub-cellular localization in Cyanothece PCC 7425. These findings are important because no gene manipulation system had been developed for Cyanothece PCC 7425, yet, handicapping its potential to serve as a model host. Furthermore, using this toolbox, we engineered Cyanothece PCC 7425 to produce the high-value terpene, limonene which has applications in biofuels, bioplastics, cosmetics, food and pharmaceutical industries. This is the first report of the engineering of a Cyanothece strain for the production of a chemical and the first demonstration that terpene can be produced by an engineered cyanobacterium growing on urea as the sole nitrogen source. © Copyright © 2020 Chenebault, Diaz-Santos, Kammerscheit, Görgen, Ilioaia, Streckaite, Gall, Robert, Marcon, Buisson, Benzerara, Sassi, Cassier-Chauvat and Chauvat.

AB  - Undoubtedly, fossil fuels being the primary source of energy have led us to milestone achievements to date. However, its alarming rate of depletion has raised concerns on a global level, which has channelized significant scientific research on biomass-to-biofuel conversion. Nonetheless, the economics of biomass conversion still poses a challenge due to low yield and conversion. In this regard, experimental studies have suggested supercritical water as a medium, which can facilitate better heat and mass transfer amidst the products and reactants. Thus, in this study, the authors applied the density functional theory (DFT) to simulate upgrading of a bio-oil model compound, levulinic acid, under supercritical water conditions. The supercritical water was defined at densities 0.089, 0.109, 0.190, and 0.360 g/cc, and the corresponding parameters (such as dielectric constant, refractive index, hydrogen-bond acidity, basicity, etc.) were manually set in the SMD implicit solvation model. The present method of model description for supercritical water within the framework of DFT is first of its kind and is the most reliable approach owing to validation with experimental results. Further, in this study, numerous pathways elaborating the conversion of levulinic acid to pentane via intermediates like pentanol and acetopropanol were simulated. The kinetic mapping of the pathways was then done by evaluating Gibbs free-energy change and enthalpy change. The supercritical water showed an advantage in deoxygenating compounds with a higher number of oxy groups. However, in some reactions like conversion of 5,5-dihydroxypentan-2-one to 5-hydroxypentan-2-one (γ-Acetopropanol), the effects of temperature and pressure were seen to offset the solvent effect. Of the four supercritical conditions, ρ = 0.109 and 0.360 g/cc were found to be the most favorable supercritical water densities for the conversion of levulinic acid. Overall, the production of pentane from levulinic acid is found to be most advantageous in the supercritical water density of ρ = 0.109 g/cc till pentane-1,4-diol and further conversion to pentane under supercritical conditions of ρ = 0.360 g/cc is the best pathway. Furthermore, the gas phase was found to be the least favorable medium in almost all of the reactions. In contrast, the presence of supercritical water showed an advantage in nearly all of the reactions suggesting supercritical water to be a suitable solvent for the production of biomass-derived chemicals. Thus, this line of investigation warrants further study, especially by experimental groups, to corroborate the findings of this study and scale-up potential. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - There are several abatement technologies used for emissions, especially NOx emissions, from Diesel engines. Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) system and alternative blend fuels are leading among the common methods used. Although the EGR provides remarkable reduction in NOx emissions, has negative effects on other emissions and engine performance. Among the alternative fuels, biodiesel and ethanol are preferred for being renewable. Chemical properties make these fuels feasible to be used in diesel blends at various ratios. Utilizing these fuels with diesel fuel in blends on engines provide improvements in engine performance parameters and emissions characteristics. However, biodiesels with oxygen content increase NOx emissions in particular. Eventually, utilizing different methods together is beneficial to optimize for the most convenient utilization ratios and conditions regarding all the emissions from engine. In this study, utilizing supercharging, EGR, biodiesel at various ratios and introducing ethanol fumigation through intake manifold of a DI diesel, and the most convenient engine operation conditions and ratios of the factors are determined through optimization using Taguchi method regarding engine brake specific heat consumption and emissions. Experiments are conducted regarding to orthogonal series L16 (42 × 22) with the combinations of factor and levels. Effect degrees of factors are determined through variation analysis. As a conclusion, factors evaluated in combination under different engine operating conditions, and factors and levels minimizing brake specific heat consumption and emissions, NO, smoke, HC, CO and CO2, are stated. © 2020

AB  - Lignin is the only biomolecule with aromatics that could serve as a feedstock to displace some petroleum for specialty chemicals. However, catalysts that are active and selective on model compounds for lignin fail when applied to real lignin with respect to performance and reaction mechanism. Here, we report kinetic data based on atomizing aqueous solutions of waste lignin, guaiacol, and syringaldehyde in a continuous catalytic fixed bed reactor operating at atmospheric pressure, a 5 s residence time, and a 30 mL min-1 (1:2 Ar:H2) volumetric flow rate (STP). The catalyst, NiMoS2 supported on activated carbon, was synthesized by a microemulsion technique and exhibited a combination of weak, strong, and very strong acid sites. Syringaldehyde reacted mostly to liquid products, and conversion increased with time-on-stream from 42% to 72% after 5 h. The main products were 2,6-dimethoxy-4-methylphenol and 1,6 dimethoxyphenol through hydrodeoxygenation and decarbonylation, respectively. Guaiacol conversion decreased with time-on-stream and ranged from 76% to 62% after 5 h. The main product was toluene via catechol, cresol, and phenol as intermediates. We propose reaction pathways for both syringaldehyde and guaiacol. The liquid fraction produced from the conversion of waste lignin contained 16 compounds that were mostly organic acids, followed by aldehydes, alcohols, and ketones. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Sub-Saharan African countries present chronic energy shortages and heavy reliance on oil imports for diesel. The small demand and high production costs in some countries have compromised the economic feasibility of the biodiesel industry in the region. Therefore, to overcome these limitations a model of “multi-countries” cooperated production and consumption of biodiesel was proposed for a group of seven neighboring countries. The model explored linear programming and simulations to the problem of minimizing biodiesel production costs considering different types of production and demand restrictions. The data processing was realized using the Solver and Linear Interactive Discrete Optimizer software (LINDO). The simulations and scenarios revealed that palm oil is the crop that minimize the production costs (US$0.82/L) and that, although jatropha was classified in the second place (US$1.05/L), it is the crop with the biggest job creation potential (5.0 times that of the palm oil seeds). These results reveal the presence of a trade-off in the strategy and the choice between different oilseeds: (a) to produce biodiesel from the crop with minimal costs (palm oil) or (b) to choose the one that has the biggest potential for job creation (jatropha). Considering the diesel price between US$0.60 and US$1.14/L at service stations in the region in 2016, both the biodiesel from palm oil and jatropha will need subsidies and fiscal incentives (tax reductions) to be competitive in the fuel market (diesel). The volume of biodiesel to supply the B10 demand in 2031 has the potential to reduce US$ 1.98 billion/year of the expenses on oil imports. It is worth observing that this decision-support model adds the “multi-countries” cooperation perspective as a contribution to the methodological and political approaches about biofuels production and consumption and can be exploited as a starting point for the formulation of policies, strategies, and investment decisions for the establishment of biodiesel production programs. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - In the latex production chain, rubber tree seeds (Hevea brasiliensis) represent an underutilized fraction with high potentialities, which can increase the sustainability of the whole process if rightly valorized. In the present study, the quality of all the fractions obtained from the rubber fruit were evaluated, with the aim to identify possible applications for their valorization with a circular economy perspective. Seeds from five different varieties of rubber tree were analyzed. Furthermore, a whole mass and energy balance was defined, which has allowed us to define hypothetical production scenarios. The obtained results show negligible differences among varieties. Shells and capsules have shown a composition similar to woody biomass, with high heating values (more than 16.5 MJ kg-1), low nitrogen content (below 0.5% on weight basis (w/w)) and reduced ash content (0.51% w/w and 1.90% w/w, respectively). Kernels were chemically extracted comparing two different solvents: n-hexane and ethanol. Both solvents showed similar extraction yields, i.e., 49% w/w and 46% w/w for n-hexane and ethanol, respectively. The resulting extraction flour was characterized by a high protein content (around 40% w/w) making it suitable for animal feeding. The rubber seed oil could be used in blends of different vegetable oils for biodiesel production. All this information is useful for improving the sustainability of the latex production chain and to assess the sustainability of possible bioenergy value chains. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Examining the influence of thermal conditions in the engine cylinder on engine combustion characteristics is critically important. This may help to understand physical and chemical processes occurring in engine cycles and this is relevant to both fossil fuels and alternative fuels like biodiesels. In this study, six different biodiesel-diesel blends (B0, B10, B20, B40, B60 and B100 representing 0, 10, 20, 40, 60 and 100% by volume of biodiesel in the diesel-biodiesel mixtures, respectively) have been successfully tested in a cooperative fuel research (CFR) engine operating under a wide range of thermal conditions at the start of fuel injection. This is a standard cetane testing CFR-F5 engine, a special tool for fuel research. In this study, it was further retrofitted to investigate combustion characteristics along with standard cetane measurements for those biodiesel blends. The novel biodiesel has been produced from residues taken from a palm cooking oil manufacturing process. It is found that the cetane number of B100 is almost 30% higher than that of B0 and this could be attributed to the oxygen content in the biofuel. Under similar thermal conditions at the start of injection, it is observed that the influence of engine load on premixed combustion is minimal. This could be attributable to the well-controlled intake air temperature in this special engine and therefore the evaporation and mixing rate prior to the start of combustion is similar under different loading conditions. Owing to higher cetane number (CN), B100 is more reactive and auto-ignites up to 3 degrees of crank angle (DCA) earlier compared to B0. It is generally observed in this study that B10 shows a higher maximum value of in-cylinder pressure compared to that of B0 and B20. This could be evidence for lubricant enhancement when operating the engine with low-blending ratio mixtures like B10 in this case. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The aqueous extraction of orange peel waste (OPW), the byproduct of the juice extraction process generated annually in massive amounts (21 Mton), yields a carbohydrate-rich liquid fraction, termed orange peel extract (OPE). Several studies highlight that the combination of glycerol, a biodiesel byproduct, with carbohydrate mixtures might boost microbial lipid production. This study performed first a shaken flask screening of 15 oleaginous yeast strains based on their growth and lipid-producing abilities on OPE- and glycerol-based media. This screening enabled the selection of R. toruloides NRRL 1091 for the assessment of the process transfer in a stirred tank reactor (STR). This assessment relied, in particular, on either single- and double-stage feeding fed-batch (SSF-FB and DSF-FB, respectively) processes where OPE served as the primary medium and nitrogen-containing glycerol-OPE mixtures as the feeding one. The continuous supply mode at low dilution rates (0.02 and 0.01 h−1 for SSF-FB and DSF-FB, respectively) starting from the end of the exponential growth of the initial batch phase enabled the temporal extension of biomass and lipid production. The SSF-FB and DSF-FB processes attained high biomass and lipid volumetric productions (LVP) and ensured significant lipid accumulation on a dry cell basis (YL/X). The SSF-FB process led to LVP of 20.6 g L−1 after 104 h with volumetric productivity (rL) of 0.20 g L−1 h−1 and YL/X of 0.80; the DSF-FB process yielded LVP, rL and YL/X values equal to 15.92 g L−1, 0.11 g L−1 h−1 and 0.65, respectively. The fatty acid profiles of lipids from both fed-batch processes were not significantly different and resembled that of Jatropha oil, a vastly used feedstock for biodiesel production. These results suggest that OPE constitutes an excellent basis for the fed-batch production of R. toruloides lipids, and this process might afford a further option in OPW-based biorefinery. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - The energy consumed around the world and especially in Morocco is dominated by oil products. The latter; whether in the global or the national context; are mainly due to diesel, whose climate impacts are well established, suggesting the search for a greener alternative. Despite its virtues, biodiesel is struggling to impose itself for purely economic reasons. Thus, in order to offer a sustainable solution, while keeping in mind the unpredictable fluctuations (price, demand …). This work proposes a generalization of fuzzy goal programming into fully fuzzy goal programming and a relative application, where the aim is to have a final product at a competitive price. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Among cyanobacteria isolated from Northern Adriatic five strains were able to grow on oil refinery wastewater. Based on the sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS region) and morphological features strains were identified as Synechococcus sp. MK568070, Phormidium lucidum MK568072, Neolyngbia sp. MK568073, Pseudanabaena sp. MK568071 and Spirulina subsalsa MK573248. Selected marine cyanobacteria were tested over a range of ammonium (NH4+) concentrations simulating oil refinery effluent conditions. Three strains demonstrated high growth potential in a range 0.8–2.0 mM NH4+. Maximum biomass concentrations in stationary phase were in a range 176–590 mg/l, whereas total lipid yields were in a range 7.63–21.40% of dry weight. Although all species satisfy the criteria for biodiesel production the average degree of unsaturation was lowest in Synechococcus sp. MK568070 and Neolyngbia sp. MK568073. High proportion of polyunsaturated alpha-linolenic acid found in Spirulina subsalsa MK573248 opens up considerations for nutritional, aquaculture or other biotechnology applications of that species. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Thermal barrier coating (TBC) implementations and oxygenated additives are remarkable issues that may decrease the exhaust emissions of engines. This study examines the effect of chromium oxide (Cr2O3) coating and the addition of ethylhexyl nitrate (EHN) on exhaust emissions of a diesel engine. In addition, an artificial neural network (ANN) model was designed which estimates exhaust emissions based on engine speed in order to reduce time, labor, and costs lost in experimental studies, and the performance of the ANN was evaluated. Piston crown and valves of engine were processed with Cr2O3. The E3, E6, and E9 blends were produced by blending 3%, 6%, and 9% (vol.) ratios of 2-ethylhexyl nitrate with diesel fuel. Engine speed was used as input parameter and carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NOX), hydrocarbon (HC), and smoke density were used as output parameters. To evaluate the performance of ANN, error rates, and regression (R) values were considered. Experimental results revealed that CO, HC, and smoke density decreased in the CE whereas NOX values increased compared with the UE. The addition of EHN reduced NOX emission and smoke density, whereas it increased CO and HC emissions. The result showed that ANN model can predict the exhaust emissions at a high accuracy rate. The lowest regression results were achieved as 0.98395, 0.99047, 0.99268, and 0.98383 for the CO, NOX, smoke density, and HC, respectively. Moreover, the average R values of NOX, HC, CO, and smoke density were obtained as 0.99767, 0.99131, 0.99396, and 0.99741. The maximum error rates of the estimated outcomes were obtained as 5.25% on average. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The search for renewable fuels or components which may improve or replace fossil fuels is an important step towards a sustainable future. In particular, the pine oleoresin produced by conifer trees, which is composed by turpentine oil and non-volatile rosin, may be transformed into alternative fuels. In this work, combustion of six molecules which can be obtained from oleoresin either by distillation (i.e., α- and β-pinene) or by further oxyfunctionalization (nopol, terpineol, myrtenol, and borneol) was studied to assess the potential of pine oleoresin as raw material for biofuels. Emission indices of the main pollutants (carbon monoxide—CO, unburned hydrocarbons—UHC, and nitrogen oxides—NOx) were obtained in non-premixed co-flow laminar flames of the oleoresin-derived molecules blended with n-heptane. The main characteristics of the flames (i.e., temperature and height) were also determined. Significant increase in flame temperature and reduction in CO and UHC emissions with respect to n-heptane were observed with nopol, terpineol, and myrtenol, along an increase in NOx emissions, suggesting an improvement in combustion performance. In addition, differences in emission indices, evidenced for these molecules (even between α- and β-pinene), suggest the importance of the molecular structure in the combustion reaction. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In order to effectively reduce the number of diesel exhaust particles and reduce particulate emissions, it is necessary to have a deep understanding of the mechanical and oxidation characteristics of diesel exhaust particles. For the combustion particles of methanol/biodiesel (BM5, BM10, and BM15), atomic force microscopy and thermogravimetric analyzers were used to study changes of particle in mechanical parameters and oxidation rules, and association impact analysis was performed. Biodiesel (B100) was used as a reference. The results showed that with the increase of methanol content, the attraction force Fat, the cohesive force Fad, the adhesion energy Wad, and Young’s modulus E of the methanol/biodiesel particles all decreased significantly. During the oxidation process, the weight loss rate of SOF increased, while the content of soot decreased. In addition, the initial combustion temperature of the SOF component TSOF and soot component Tsoot in particles as well as the burn-out temperature Tend showed a downward trend. There was a certain correlation between the mechanical parameters and the oxidation properties of the particles. The smaller the mechanical parameters, such as the attraction force Fat, viscous force Fad, the cohesive force Fad, the adhesion energy Wad, and Young’s modulus E, the greater the looseness of the particles, the smaller the particle hardness and the degree of graphitization. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Intracellular phosphorus (P) accumulation can improve microalgal growth and lipid synthesis. However, large excess of P causes cell poisoning. This study utilized a P-fed-batch strategy to investigate its potential to improve the utilization of the excessive P, while avoiding toxic side effects. This strategy contributed to a more complete utilization of the intracellularly stored P, which enhanced the microalgae biomass by 10−15% by upregulating the brassinosteroid growth hormone gene at a P-fed-batch frequency of 2−8. Furthermore, the lipid content increased by 4−16% via upregulation of lipid synthesis-related genes. As a result, the P-fed-batch strategy significantly increased the lipid production by 13−19%. The content of saturated fatty acid increased by ~ 100%, implying improved combustibility and oxidative stability. This is the first study of this P-fed-batch strategy and provides a new concept for the complete utilization of excessive P. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study focused on the valorization of the date syrup obtained from low-quality date fruits to be used as a low-cost alternative medium for producing single cell oil (SCO) by Rhodotorula glutinis PTCC5256, which could further be converted into biodiesel. The higher C/N ratio of date syrup (C/N 70) led to restricting the formation of cell biomass and enhancing the biosynthesis of SCO. The maximal cell biomass and lipid productivities were obtained 72 mg/L/h and 17 mg/L/h by C/N ratios of 20 and 70, respectively. Although the obtained biodiesel met the international standards for cold filter plugging point (4.92 °C), iodine value (87.22 g I2/100 g oil), cetane number (52.26), higher heating value (40.19 MJ/kg), cloud point (6.29 °C), pour point (0.00 °C), density (878 kg/m3), kinematic viscosity (4.30 mm2/s) and oxidation stability (7.87 h), its weak cold-flow properties might limit its application in cold areas in comparison with diesel fuel. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Microalgae from genus Scenedesmus sensu lato (including Desmodesmus and Scenedesmus) were reported to be particularly suitable candidates for CO2 biomitigation. In this study, 16 strains from Scenedesmus sensu lato were obtained from different climate zones of China and their phylogenetic positions were determined. Seven strains out of the 16 showed high CO2 tolerance and grew much faster under 20% CO2 than air condition. Two representatives from genera Desmodesmus (NMD46) and Scenedesmus (HBX310) respectively were selected due to their higher lipid productivity, and the maximum value of 146 mg L−1 day−1 was achieved in NMD46. Triacylglycerols increased with the rising of CO2 levels from 0.04 to 15% in NMD46, while they changed little in HBX310. High CO2 level decreased the polyunsaturated fatty acid content in NMD46 but increased it in HBX310. NMD46 is more suitable for standardized biodiesel production in view of its lipid and fatty acid composition responses to high CO2. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The awareness for an effective utilization of renewable energy and alternative fuels has been increasing. As alternative fuels, both liquid and gaseous biofuels have huge resources. A bio-CNG is a form of biogas with increased methane content. The present study comprises the development of intake manifold with the port fuel injector and investigate the mixing characteristics of air and bio-CNG. The aim of the study is to analyse the effect the R/D ratio on the flow behaviour and mixture formation of air and bio-CNG. The four configurations of intake manifold are investigated. The ratio of radius of curvature of manifold bend (R) to the diameter of manifold (D) is varied as 1, 1.5, 1.75 and 2. The port fuel injector for bio-CNG induction is placed at 200 mm from the manifold. The objective is to optimize the intake manifold to deliver the homogeneous mixture of air and bio-CNG inside the engine cylinder. As the bio-CNG is new age fuel, being produced to reduce the import of conventional CNG, the work for optimization of port injector and intake manifold are hardly available. The geometries are made in PTC-Creo 3.0, followed by CFD simulation in ANSYS Fluent. The different configurations are analysed for the comparison of the parameters such as, pressure, velocity, turbulence kinetic energy, helicity and mass fraction of CH4. The results show that the distribution of bio-CNG near the outlet of the manifold is uniform and homogeneous for the manifold with R/D ratio of 1.75 and 2. © 2020, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - This work explored the problem of using gaseous biofuels with different content of hydrogen and carbon monoxide in a three-cylinder naturally aspirated spark-ignition (SI) engine under laboratory conditions. The tests investigated the combustion process of simulated gases, whose composition was similar to the syngas generated from biomass gasification processes. During the lab tests, the engine operated at a constant speed and wide-open throttle. The engine control parameters and syngas composition influence on the combustion process, performance, as well as its harmful effects on the environment were analysed. The assay also focused on the fast-changing combustion parameters (heat release rate - HRR, mass fraction burned - MFB and combustion duration) based on in-cylinder pressure measurements. Gaseous fuels using during the tests were free from contamination and moisture. A clear impact of the molar fraction ratio H2/CO in the syngas mixture on the internal parameters of the tested engine could be observed. Syngas with higher hydrogen content required the use of slightly lower ignition advance to get the maximum value of Indicated Mean Effective Pressure of the engine - IMEP. The lower heating value of the syngas fuel did not directly affect the indicated efficiency of the engine. The decisive influencing factor indeed was the type and molar fraction of combustible and inert components at the syngas mixture. For syngas mixtures with higher H2 content, increasing the excess gas ratio increased the indicated efficiency. A clear correlation was found between the carbon monoxide content of the synthesis gas mixture and the specific emission of CO in the engine exhaust gas. Nevertheless, keeping the carbon monoxide content constant and increasing the hydrogen content in the syngas mixture resulted in a decrease of specific CO emissions. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - For thermochemical conversion routes to BtL fuel production, in part 1, we have developed a framework for the synthesis of a BtL superstructure that was formulated by the interconnection of processing blocks consisting of unit operations belonging to five base case process routes along with the data and information prepared for the embedded processing blocks. In part 2, a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is implemented for the superstructure optimization. The superstructure is defined as an MINLP problem coded in GAMS 24.5.6, which sets the objective to minimize the total cost of manufacturing (TCOM) of BtL fuels under different cases and integration scenarios. Three cases are demonstrated for three different product profiles, and three network flowsheets are obtained as optimal technology routes. The three optimal network flowsheets are then rigorously simulated and compared with the base case process flowsheets. The results demonstrated that this methodology can generate optimal BtL biofuel production processes under different product scenarios. Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this study raw cardanol, which is a renewable biofuel, was blended with kerosene and used as a test fuel in a four-stroke variable compression ratio 3.5-kW diesel engine. Volume basis test blends of cardanol and kerosene, such as BK20 (20% kerosene and 80% cardanol), BK30 (30% kerosene and 70% cardanol) and BK40 (40% kerosene and 60% cardanol), were prepared and tested for three different compression ratios (16:1, 17:1 and 18:1) at various load conditions and compared with diesel fuel. It was observed that when the compression ratio increased from 16:1 to 18:1, the brake thermal efficiency increased from 23.87 to 27.30% for BK20, 26.83 to 29.87% for BK30, and 24.28 to 28.62% for BK40, with reduction in carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbon and smoke emission. But NOx emission was increased by 18.7, 1.8 and 7.3%, respectively, for BK20, BK30 and BK40 blends at the highest compression ratio relative to diesel. This study demonstrates that cardanol–kerosene blends can be used as diesel engine fuel at higher compression ratios. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Biodiesel is considered to be a natural substitute for fossil fuel. The comparatively low toxicity of biodiesel and its susceptibility to microbial biodegradation could reduce its environmental impact. Currently, biodiesel is sold previously mixed with petroleum-based hydrocarbons. The aim of this work was to measure the biodegradation potential of commercially available biodiesel, using bacterial strains (BBCOL-001, BBCOL-002, and BBCOL-003) isolated from a tropical forest soils in the Colombian Caribbean. According to nucleotide sequencing of the gene encoding for 16S rRNA, the strains belong to members of the genus Cellulosimicrobium. GC–MS analysis showed that biodiesel-oil alkanes were degraded by an average of 81.5% with optical density reaching 0.2–0.3 in minimal salt media at 37°C for 5 days. Individual diesel-oil alkanes were degraded by the strains at rates between 64.9% to 100%. The increase in bacterial biomass confirmed the use of the substrates by the microorganisms, suggesting these hydrocarbons are a carbon source. Changes in the biochemical behaviour of the strains suggested their capacity to adapt to environmental conditions might be an important resource for bioremediation. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - There is increasing interest in the harnessing of energy from waste owing to the increase in global waste generation and inadequate currently implemented waste disposal practices, such as composting, landfilling or dumping. The purpose of this study is to provide a modelling and simulation framework to analyze the technical potential of treating municipal solid waste (MSW) and refuse-derived fuel (RDF) for the polygeneration of biofuels along with district heating (DH) and power. A flexible waste gasification polygeneration facility is proposed in this study. Two types of waste—MSW and RDF—are used as feedstock for the polygeneration process. Three different gasifiers—the entrained flow gasifier (EFG), circulating fluidized bed gasifier (CFBG) and dual fluidized bed gasifier (DFBG)—are compared. The polygeneration process is designed to produce DH, power and biofuels (methane, methanol/dimethyl ether, gasoline or diesel and ammonia). Aspen Plus is used for the modelling and simulation of the polygeneration processes. Four cases with different combinations of DH, power and biofuels are assessed. The EFG shows higher energy efficiency when the polygeneration process provides DH alongside power and biofuels, whereas the DFBG and CFBG show higher efficiency when only power and biofuels are produced. RDF waste shows higher efficiency as feedstock than MSW in polygeneration process. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Caldicellulosiruptorbescii is the most thermophilic cellulolytic organism yet identified (Topt 78 °C). It grows on untreated plant biomass and has an established genetic system thereby making it a promising microbial platform for lignocellulose conversion to bio-products. Here, we investigated the ability of engineered C.bescii to generate alcohols from carboxylic acids. Expression of aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase (aor from Pyrococcusfuriosus) and alcohol dehydrogenase (adhA from Thermoanaerobacter sp. X514) enabled C.bescii to generate ethanol from crystalline cellulose and from biomass by reducing the acetate produced by fermentation. Deletion of lactate dehydrogenase in a strain expressing the AOR–Adh pathway increased ethanol production. Engineered strains also converted exogenously supplied organic acids (isobutyrate and n-caproate) to the corresponding alcohol (isobutanol and hexanol) using both crystalline cellulose and switchgrass as sources of reductant for alcohol production. This is the first instance of an acid to alcohol conversion pathway in a cellulolytic microbe. © 2020, Society for Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology.

AB  - First-generation biofuel biorefineries may be a starting point for the development of new value chains, as their by-products and side streams retain nutrients and valuable molecules that may be recovered and valorized for high-value applications. This study provides a chemical characterization of post-fermentation corn oil and thin stillage, side streams of dry-grind corn bioethanol production, in view of their valorization. An overall long-term study was conducted on the two co-products collected over 1 year from a bioethanol plant. Water content, acid value, sedimentation, mineral composition, and fatty acid profiles were analyzed on post-fermentation corn oil. Results highlighted that its acid value was high (19.72–24.29 mg KOH/g), indicating high levels of free fatty acids, but stable over the year due to standardized operating conditions. The fatty acid profile was that typical of corn oil, with a prevalence of linoleic (54–59% of total fatty acids) over oleic (23–27%) and palmitic (12–17%) acids. Macronutrients, fatty acid, and mineral profiles were investigated in thin stillage. Results revealed the acidic pH (4.05–4.68) and high dilution (90–93% water) of this side stream. The dry mass was composed of fats (19–30%), proteins (8.8–12.8%), ash (8.7–9.5%), and fiber (7.3–9.8%). The concomitant presence of a variegate complex of molecules of nutritional interest in corn bioethanol co-products, with several potential high-value market applications, make the perspective of their recovery a promising strategy to create new cross-sector interconnections according to circular economy principles. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The global concentration of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is increasing as well as the emissions of harmful pollutants. Utilization of liquid biofuels in combustion engines helps to reduce these negative effects. For diesel engines, the most common alternative fuels are based on vegetable oils. Blending neat vegetable oils with diesel and/or alcohol fuels is a simple way to make them suitable for diesel engines. In this study, coconut oil was used in ternary fuel blends with diesel and butanol. Coconut oil is a potentially usable source of renewable energy, especially in the Pacific, where it is a local product. Diesel fuel-coconut oil-butanol fuel blends were used in concentrations of 70%/20%/10% and 60%/20%/20%, and 100% diesel fuel was used as a reference. The effect of the fuel blends on the production of harmful emissions, engine smoke, performance parameters, fuel consumption and solid particles production was monitored during the measurement. The engine was kept at a constant speed during the measurement and the load was selected at 50%, 75% and 100%. From the results, it can be stated that in comparison with diesel fuel, specific fuel consumption increased with a positive effect on the reduction of engine smoke. © 2020 MDPI AG.

AB  - The alcohols ethanol and 1-butanol are interesting options as blending components for renewable fuels. We studied whether it is possible to mix these alcohols with a little refined material, rapeseed oil, to obtain stable fuel samples. At room temperature, the stable samples consisted of rapeseed oil blended with butanol at 5 vol-%, 10 vol-%, 20 vol-%, 30 vol-% and one sample of rapeseed oil with 5 vol-% of ethanol. The samples' fuel properties analysed were kinematic viscosity (at 40_C), density (at 15 C) and surface tension. Cold filter plugging point was measured for rapeseed oil with 20 vol-% and 30 vol-% of butanol. Stability of butanol or ethanol and rapeseed oil blends can be achieved at the studied volumes. The density of neat rapeseed oil and all the alcohol-rapeseed oil blends met the requirements set for residual marine fuels. The 30 vol-% butanol-rapeseed oil blend met the requirements for distillate marine oil for density, and almost for kinematic viscosity. The blends appeared most suitable for power plants and marine engines. More detailed analyses of their properties are needed before recommendations for use can be given. © 2020 MDPI AG.

AB  - Screening new alternative vegetable oil sources as biodiesel feedstocks has attracted worldwide attention as world oil reserves decline and environmental concerns increase. Blessed thistle (Cnicus benedictus L.) has recently been identified as a multipurpose crop with optimal economic yield in poor soils. Blessed thistle was seeded into three different site soil conditions (site 1: silt clay loam, site 2: sandy loam, site 3: saline sandy loam) in eastern North Dakota, USA to evaluate agronomic performance and seed properties as well as biodiesel potential. The highest biomass and plant heights were obtained from the sandy loam soil, while plants grown in saline sandy loam soil had similar seed and oil yield, and similar oil content as plants grown in other site soil conditions. Biodiesel obtained from blessed thistle oil in the saline site was an excellent substitute for fossil fuels. The saline soil did not influence the blessed thistle oil yield; however, the saline soil did affect the fatty acid composition and biodiesel properties with some improvement in biodiesel quality. Results showed that blessed thistle was a promising species for biodiesel feedstock, especially for marginal soils such as the saline soil conditions in North Dakota. © 2020

AB  - In the present study, pyrolysis of pine needles has been conducted in a semi-batch reactor at different operating parameters such as particle size, temperature and flow rate of nitrogen for bio-oil production. The maximum bio-oil yield of 43.5% was obtained at a temperature of 550 °C, N2 flow rate of 100 ml/min and particle size of 462μ. At the above optimum conditions, catalytic pyrolysis was observed that bio-oil yield decreased up to 35.2%. The analysis of bio-oil by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) shows that zeolite HZSM-5 catalyst increases the production of aromatic hydrocarbon compounds and reduces the oxygenated compounds as compared to non-catalytic pyrolysis bio-oil. From the analysis, it has been confirmed that catalytic bio-oil produces more diesel and gasoline range compounds in comparison to non-catalytic bio-oil. In pyrolysis, products such as 2, 5 dimethyl furan compounds have been found that can be easily used as gasoline range compounds as well as rocket engine fuel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Butanethiol is a contaminant of aviation biokerosene, and its monitoring is of great importance to evaluate the quality of this biofuel. In this work, the elucidation of the electrochemical behavior of butanethiol was carried out using a glassy carbon electrode in order to contribute to the development of future electroanalytical methods to determine this contaminant in aviation biokerosene. The results obtained showed that the electrooxidation of butanethiol is controlled by diffusion and occurs irreversibly in two steps: a well-defined anodic peak at 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl (3.0 mol L−1) and an ill-defined anodic wave at 1.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl (3.0 mol L−1). The Randles-Sevcik and Tafel equations were used to determine the diffusion coefficient (D) and electronic transfer coefficient (α), respectively. In addition, the mechanism of the butanethiol oxidation reaction was proposed based on the number of protons and electrons involved. Good linear relations were obtained between peak currents and butanethiol concentrations by cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry. As a proof of concept, the glassy carbon electrode was applied to determine the butanethiol molecule in an aviation biokerosene sample. The results obtained showed that this electrode has remarkable accuracy when applied toward the determination of butanethiol.

AB  - The biodiesel is important as a renewable fuel, but some parameters of the industrial production, such as the use of homogeneous catalysts and the large quantities of residues (wastewater and glycerin) are a problem. In this work, four heterogeneous catalysts were synthesized by the hydrolytic Sol-Gel method for the biodiesel production and to possible reduce the production costs because the catalyst can be reused. The catalyst can also reduce the wastewater and glycerin contaminations. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, basicity determination, and infrared spectroscopy. According to the National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels, the biodiesel samples were characterized by specific gravity, copper corrosivity, kinematic viscosity, acidity, Karl Fischer coulometry, and gas chromatography. The wastewaters were characterized by ultraviolet and visible spectroscopy, pH, dissolved oxygen, ashes, and solids (total, volatile, and non-volatile). The wastewater from heterogeneous catalysis was less harmful to the environment and can be easily treated, with reduction of 78.58% of organic residues to be converted by the wastewater treatment. In conclusion, the new catalyst produced biodiesel successfully and showed high catalytic activity (97.58% of ester content and 92.94% of yield), and produced wastewater and glycerin with lower amount of residues (eco-friendly). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Improving the competitiveness of biodiesel production by microalgae cultures requires the application of several strategies to obtain a high content of lipids, rapid biomass growth and a capacity to adapt to different kinds of environment, with the aim of using non-renewable nutrient sources. Therefore, the use of an individual indigenous microalgae strain or a consortium from natural or anthropogenic sites is now considered an alternative for biofuel production. This study examined the temporal behaviour of secondary metabolites produced by a native microalgae and yeast consortium isolated from wastewater, which was characterized by a genetic identification method based on the MiSeq system. The predominant species in the consortium was Scenedesmus obliquus, representing 68% of the organisms. In addition, the consortium contained a number of yeast species, including Candida pimensis (43%), Arthroderma vanbreuseghemii (23%), Diaporthe aspalathi/Diaporthe meridionalis (25%) and Hericium americanum (3%). This indigenous co-culture of microalgae and yeast showed biomass productivity of 0.06 g l−1 day−1, with a content of 30% (w/w) carbohydrates, 4% (w/w) proteins and 55% (w/w) lipids. Transesterification of the extracted lipids produced fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), which were analysed by gas chromatography (GC). The FAMEs included methyl pentadecanoate (1.90%), cis-10-pentanedecanoic acid methyl ester (1.36%), methyl palmitate (2.64%), methyl palmitoleate (21.36%), methyl oleate (64.95%), methyl linolenate (3.83%) and methyl linolelaidate (3.95%). This composition was relevant for biodiesel production based on the co-culture of indigenous microalgae and yeast consortia. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Biodiesel is among the solutions to substitute petroleum-based fuel. However, the autoxidation ability of biodiesel, which results in degradation of the existing oxygen, has delayed its use on a global level. A potential solution to this problem is the addition of antioxidant additives. Palm oil methyl ester (POME) is the most popular biodiesel in Malaysia. Diesel 80% + POME 20% (B20) was added with two types of monophenolic antioxidant additives, which were butylated hydroxytoluene and butylated hydroxyanisole, at 1000 ppm and 1500 ppm concentrations, respectively, to examine their effects on combustion characteristics, engine performances and exhaust emissions. Hielscher UP400S ultrasonic emulsifier was used to prepare the fuel blends at 20% of the maximum stirring speed. Yanmar TF120M single-cylinder diesel engine was employed at a constant speed of 1800 rpm with various engine loads. The results showed that B20 and antioxidant-treated B20 produced a mean increase in brake specific fuel consumption of 8.33%–23.27% and reduced brake thermal efficiency by a mean that was 8.40%–24.95% greater than that of diesel fuel. Both antioxidants reduced nitrogen oxide emission by a mean of 12.92%–30.54%, compared to B20. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Wine industry generates a large amount of biowaste, such as grape marc and wine lees, which is considered in the Directive (EU) 2018/2001 as an adequate feedstock to produce advanced biofuels. Grapeseed oil fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) can be obtained from oil extracted from grape marc and bioethanol distilled from wine lees or wine surplus. Although FAEE still has no specific standard, grapeseed oil FAEE would fulfill all of the properties set by the standard EN 14214, except oxidation stability. This work analyzes the effect of natural antioxidants on the oxidation stability of grapeseed oil FAEE, using grapeseed oil fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) as a reference for comparison. On the one hand, the biofuel, produced with conventional transesterification, was mixed with FAME and FAEE produced via in situ transesterification. On the other hand, antioxidants extracted from grapeseed or defatted grapeseed flour were added to the biofuel. The results show that (1) FAEE has worse oxidation stability than FAME, (2) in situ transesterification improves the oxidation stability, and (3) addition of natural antioxidants is hindered by their low solubility in alkyl esters. Finally, the concentration of antioxidants, measured by UV-vis spectroscopy, showed a correlation between the absorbance at 285 nm (characteristic of phenolic compounds) and the induction time (IT) of the samples.

AB  - Macroalgae are a valuable energy source that can be transformed into numerous products most notably fuels and chemicals due to their high content of carbohydrates, proteins, and vitamins. In order to use macroalgae on a commercial scale, it is essential to evaluate various potential pathways into value-added products as well as intermediate components and technologies. Furthermore, the prospective processes have to be economically competitive while simultaneously offering minimum environmental impact in terms of carbon and other waste emissions. This in turn presents a large decision-making problem with a significant combinatorial complexity. This study addresses this problem by utilizing a superstructure process design approach for a seaweed biorefinery which produces mixed alcohols and mixed organic acids via an anaerobic digestion/volatile fatty acid route. Seventeen design alternatives have been proposed to determine the optimal design and technical feasibility by maximizing the net present value in the most environmentally beneficial manner. The results indicate that biofuel production from macroalgae is economically viable at a minimum ethanol selling price of $1.17 gal-1. Furthermore, the optimal design enables a 90% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. Results of the sensitivity analysis show that seaweed price is the most important parameter that can contribute in improving the economics, thereby confirming that the cost-effective and efficient large-scale seaweed cultivation is of utmost importance to the success of macroalgae-based biofuel production. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Crude glycerol from biodiesel production is not of high quality due to catalyst and alcohol contamination. A product that could utilize glycerol, excess alcohol and catalysts could enhance the value proposition for the biodiesel industry. Here, we show that glycerol can be reacted with methanol and tert-butanol in the presence of common transesterification catalysts to produce an ether-rich mixture that is miscible with biodiesel. Our studies cover the impact of type and concentration of catalysts, molar ratio of reactants, temperature, and reaction time on alcohol conversion, product yield, selectivity and select fuel properties. Results show both NaOH and H2SO4 are capable of producing etherified blends from glycerol that are miscible with biodiesel. We anticipate the results to be a starting point for the development of an effective fuel additive to recycle the byproduct glycerol and excess alcohol resulting from biodiesel production. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Nickel-based catalysts play an important role in the hydrogen-free deoxygenation for the production of biofuel. The yield and quality of the biofuel are critically affected by the physicochemical properties of NiO supported on nanosized zeolite Y (Y65, crystal size of 65 nm). Therefore, 10 wt% NiO supported on Y65 synthesized by using impregnation (IM) and deposition-precipitation (DP) methods were investigated. It was found that preparation methods have a significant effect on the deoxygenation of triolein. The initial rate of the DP method (14.8 goil•h-1) was 1.5 times higher than that of the IM method (9.6 goil•h-1). The DP-Y65 showed the best deoxygenation performance with a 80.0% conversion and a diesel selectivity of 93.7% at 380 °C within 1 h. The outstanding performance from the DP method was due to the smaller NiO particle size (3.57 ± 0.40 nm), high accessibility (H. F value of 0.084), and a higher Bronsted to Lewis acidity (B/L) ratio (0.29), which has improved the accessibility and deoxygenation ability of the catalyst. The NH4+ released from the decomposition of the urea during the DP process increased the B/L ratio of zeolite NaY. As a result, the pretreatment to convert Na-zeolite to H-zeolite in a conventional zeolite synthesis can be avoided. In this regard, the DP method offers a one-pot synthesis to produce smaller NiO-supported nanosized zeolite NaY with a high B/L ratio, and it managed to produce a higher yield with selectivity towards green diesel via deoxygenation under a hydrogen-free condition. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Transport greenhouse gas emissions are mainly caused by the use of fossil fuels, e.g., gasoline and diesel. This case study for The Netherlands calculates how alternative fuels, e.g., electricity, hydrogen or biofuels, contribute to policy aims to decarbonize transport. Alternative fuels, produced in various ways, have different carbon (CF), land (LFs) and water footprints (WFs). This study assesses CFs, LFs and WFs for fuels (kgCO2e/m2/m3 per GJ), showing differences among fuels dependent on primary energy sources. It calculates CFs, LFs and WFs for four scenarios with different fuels. The biofuel scenario is not attractive. CFs slightly decrease, while LFs and WFs increase enormously. The electricity scenario has small CFs and the smallest LFs and WFs, but this is only when using wind or solar energy. If storage is needed and hydrogen is produced using wind energy, CFs double from 3055 to 7074 kg CO2e, LFs increase from 15 × 106 to 43 × 106 m2 and WFs from 3 × 106 to 37 × 106 m3 compared to the electricity scenario. The case study shows that wise fuel choices contribute to policy aims to decarbonize transport, although LFs and WFs are also important to consider. These case study results are relevant for sustainable transportation transitions worldwide. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Plastic waste is accumulating globally and its harmful environmental effects are on the rise. In order to reduce the challenges of waste management, the valorization of this heterogeneous plastic waste is of vital importance. The transformation of waste plastic for the production of alternative fuel is among the most promising pathway for its treatment. In this context, pyrolysis is an emerging trend, which can transform a wide variety of wastes into plastic oil. Due to the abundance and unlimited accessibility of the feedstock, higher heating value, the waste plastic pyrolyzed oil can be a potential extender fuel for CI engines. In the present study, an attempt has been made to improve the performance and emission characteristics of diesel-waste cooking oil (WCO) biodiesel blends by adding waste plastic pyrolyzed oil (WPPO). Different test fuels containing 10% and 20% by volume of waste plastic pyrolyzed oil, 20% by volume of waste cooking oil biodiesel, and 60%, 70%, and 80% by volume of diesel were prepared and labeled as D80B20, D70B20P10, and D60B20P20, respectively. To investigate the engine ignition characteristics of test fuels, ignition probability was calculated. Further, the performance and emission characteristics of test fuels were evaluated by conducting the engine trials at different loading conditions. A single-cylinder DI four-stroke diesel engine was used for the analysis, and the outcomes were compared with neat diesel (D100). The test fuel containing 20% vol. of WPPO (D60B20P20) showed up to 12.2% increase in brake thermal efficiency and up to 9.6% decrease in brake-specific energy consumption in comparison with diesel and biodiesel blends. The exhaust emissions were also decreased considerably as the percentage of WPPO in fuel blend is increased. At full load, an overall reduction of about 30% in NOx, CO, and UBHC emissions was observed for D60B20P20 in comparison with neat diesel. © 2020, Saudi Society for Geosciences.

AB  - In the last few decades, consciousness of fossil fuel resources and increased environmental concerns have given the need for emergence of alternative fuel. Biodiesel is one of the potential renewable energies produced from edible and non-edible biomass which could be a potential alternative for petrol-derived diesel. In this work, initially the process of biodiesel production from waste cooking oil using potassium hydroxide as catalyst and the process parameters were studied in laboratory. The maximum biodiesel yield of 97% was attained at 75 °C with 1 wt% catalyst concentration and oil-methanol molar ratio of 1:06 at 350 rpm and 90 min. Also, these process conditions were used for biodiesel production in the pilot plant and obtained 97% yield. Overall, mass balance for the pilot plant was studied to analyze the product yield loss. The fatty acid methyl ester formation in the plant was confirmed by characterization with FTIR and 1H NMR. Further, the quality of biodiesel produced was compared for its physiochemical properties with the ASTM standards. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Renewable drop-in fuels provide a short- to medium-term solution to decreasing carbon dioxide emissions from the transport sector. Polyoxymethylene ethers (OME) are among interesting candidates with production pathways both from biomass (bio-OME) as well as electricity and CO2 (e-OME) proposed. In the present study, both bio- and e-OME production via methanol are assessed for energy performance and carbon footprint. Process integration methods are applied to evaluate synergies from colocating methanol production with further conversion to OME. Even a hybrid process, combing bio- and e-OME production is evaluated. The energy efficiency of bio-OME is considerably higher than for the e-OME pathway, and colocation synergies are more evident for bio-OME. Carbon footprint is evaluated according to EUs recast Renewable Energy Directive (RED II). If renewable electricity and natural gas are used for power and heat supply, respectively, results indicate that all pathways may be counted toward the renewable fuel targets under RED II. The largest emissions reduction is 92.8% for colocated hybrid-OME production. Carbon footprints of e- and hybrid-OME are highly sensitive to the carbon intensity of electricity, and the carbon intensity of the heat supply has a major impact on results for all pathways except colocated bio- and hybrid-OME. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - The present world faces the crisis of fossil fuels as it will no longer sustain in the future, gives a knowledge to look on waste resources, where waste rice and neem seed are utilizable for the production of biofuels by the process of fermentation and transesterification. In this paper, the physiochemical properties of the produced biofuels are examined. The 5% rice wine alcohol is used as an additive with neem methyl ester-diesel blend to lower the viscosity and flash point for the better performance in the single cylinder compression ignition engine. Different blends as D90B5RW5, D85B10RW5, D75B20RW5, and D65B30RW5 are prepared and examined experimentally by varying the engine loads (0–100%) at constant engine speed (1500 rpm). Experimental results showed the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC) and smoke opacity, however oxide of nitrogen (NOx) is found higher. In the performance, D75B20RW5 shows 8% higher brake thermal efficiency and 3.33% lower brake specific fuel consumption compared to diesel. While in the combustion the peak cylinder pressure and net heat release rate are seen to be higher for biodiesel blends with additive. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In recent days, the scientific community has been forced to develop renewable fuels due to the demand and increasing cost of conventional fuels. Among the different renewable fuels, biodiesel is a primary renewable fuel produced by the efficient and straightforward process (i.e., catalytic transesterification) with the homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts. The heterogeneous catalysts are of greater interest in industrial biodiesel production, offering high activity, easy separation, low cost of production, and high reusability. Various studies have shown that the heterogeneous catalysts of calcium and potassium oxides offer a faster reaction rate. In this context, this study provides an overview of calcium and potassium oxide catalysts derived from waste resources. This study also presents the biomass catalytic preparation method and the optimal process conditions under which high biodiesel yield can be achieved. On the whole, the core objective of this study is to find the feasibility of biomass-derived catalyst in the commercial sector and to determine its suitability for sustainable industrial application. © 2020 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - With a high number of diesel vehicles worldwide, particulate emission control is an urgent issue with a global impact, from the health of citizens to commercial future of this technology in some transport segments. Particulate filters are widely used in automotive engines to comply emissions regulations, but current technologies have room for improvement as they add additional backpressure in the exhaust system, and efficient on-board regeneration process is challenging. The Fil-Bio-Diesel Project is a R&D initiative to improve current particle filtration systems, based on the development of novel biomorphic substrates. By replicating the biologic tissue of a wood precursor, a biomorphic silicon carbide with hierarchic orthotropic microstructure can be produced. The porosity, the pore size, and pore orientation of this bioceramic material can be tailored through the selection of a suitable precursor, widening the initially narrow relationship between filtration efficiency and pressure drop that characterizes granular ceramic materials. In this paper the methodology and main results of the Fil-Bio-Diesel Project are presented. This work shows the peculiar advantages of biomorphic silicon carbide through several experimental studies. The results show the potential of this novel filter substrate to be used in future particulate abatement systems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Domestically produced biofuels may help to reduce dependence on imported oil for powering transportation and infrastructure in the future. In this report, five oxygenated biofuels were synthesized by simple condensation reactions of fusel pentanols, 3-methyl-1-butanol and 2-methyl-1-butanol, forming ethers, acetals and carbonate ester. Basic fuel property testing (melting point, density, kinematic viscosity, derived cetane number and calorific value) of the fusel biofuels were collected. The difusel carbonate was the least useful of the group with the lowest energy content (30.46 kJ/g) and lowest cetane number (22.8). The ether and acetal derivatives appeared useful as diesel fuels or additives with energy content of 35.3–39.94 kJ/g and cetane numbers of 53.5–94. The two ether derivatives had energy content and cetane numbers which surpassed those of biodiesel. © 2020

AB  - Lignocellulosic biodiesel waste of Jatropha husk (JH) was used to develop ZnCl2 activated Jatropha husk carbon (ZAJHC). ZAJHC was applied as an adsorbent for the removal of methylene blue (MB) from contaminated water. Batch mode of adsorption experiments were carried out and the parameters investigated included agitation time, MB concentration (100-180 mg L-1) and adsorbent dose (25-200 mg/50 mL). The adsorption of MB reached equilibrium at 120 min for 100 mg L-1, 140 min for 120 mg L-1 and 160 min for other concentrations tested. Based on the Langmuir isotherm, the monolayer adsorption capacity (Q0) was found to be 500 mg g-1. The kinetic data were also fitted to the pseudo first-order, second-order and intraparticle diffusion models, and the experimental data followed closely the pseudo first-order kinetic model. Thermodynamic parameters such as standard enthalpy (ΔH 3.86 J mol-1 K-1), standard entropy (ΔS 65.86 J mol-1 K-1) and standard free energy (ΔG) indicated the spontaneous nature of MB adsorption by ZAJHC. The adsorption was found to be endothermic in nature. Alkaline pH was favourable for the adsorption of MB. The pH effect and desorption studies suggest that ion-exchange might be the possible mechanism governing the adsorption process. © IWA Publishing 2020 Journal of Water Supply: Research and Technology-AQUA

AB  - Microalgae have been extensively tested for their ability to create bio-based fuels. Microalgae have also been explored as an alternative wastewater treatment solution due to their significant uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as their ability to grow in different water types. Recently, there has been significant interest in combining these two characteristics to create economic and environmentally friendly biofuel using wastewater. This study examined the growth and lipid production of the microalgae Porphyridium (P.) cruentum grown in swine wastewater (ultra-filtered and raw) as compared with control media (L-1, modified f/2) at two different salt concentrations (seawater and saltwater). The cultivation of P. cruentum in the treated swine wastewater media (seawater = 5.18 ± 2.3 mgL-1day-1, saltwater = 3.32 ± 1.93 mgL-1day-1) resulted in a statistically similar biomass productivity compared to the control medium (seawater = 2.61 ± 2.47 mgL-1day-1, saltwater = 6.53 ± 0.81 mgL-1day-1) at the corresponding salt concentration. Furthermore, no major differences between the fatty acid compositions of microalgae in the treated swine wastewater medium and the control medium were observed. For all conditions, saturated acids were present in the highest amounts (≥67%), followed by polyunsaturated (≤22%) and finally monounsaturated (≤12%). This is the first study to find that P. cruentum could be used to remediate wastewater and then be turned into fuel by using swine wastewater with a similar productivity to the microalgae grown in control media. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Microalgae-based biodiesel is increasingly recognized as an alternative to crop-based biodiesel. In this study, 10 local strains of dinoflagellates collected from Hong Kong waters, including a monoculture and field sample of Scrippsiella sp. isolated from an algal bloom, were evaluated against the performance of green alga Tetraselmis suecica. The specific growth rate, biomass production, lipid productivity, and fatty acid profile were investigated. The total lipid content of isolated strains ranged from 16.2% to 32.2% of the total dry biomass, whereas palmitic acid (C16:0) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6n3) were dominant in the fatty acid profile. Scrippsiella sp. has a high lipid productivity (47.3 mg/L/day) and fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) content (55.2-73 mg/g dry weight (dw), which were comparable to that in green alga T. suecica. Further, monoculture and field sampled blooming Scrippsiella sp. showed no significant difference in most parameters, suggesting the possibility of harvesting a natural algal bloom population as a mitigation strategy to harmful algal bloom and to use as biodiesel feedstock. Overall, dinoflagellate species showed a slower growth rate (0.04-0.57 day-1) than most compared species (0.07-1.34 day-1), likely due to a large genome size and low chlorophyll to carbon ratio. Notably, most investigated dinoflagellates were not ideal for mass biodiesel production due to the low growth rate and lipid productivity. However, a high level of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in dinoflagellates are prospective for further studies in other biotechnological applications. Though effectively harvesting algal blooming biomass can be complex, it can be further explored as a strategy for algal bloom mitigation and potentially creating values at the advantage of natural bloom when applying harvested biomass for biodiesel and bioactive compounds extraction. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The European Union (EU) considers biofuels as an option to reduce GHG emissions. However, biofuels mandates are controversial because of the concerns regarding unintended environmental, social and economic consequences. EU renewable energy directives introduced some requirements that biofuels should meet to be certified as sustainable. Today almost all the EU’s biofuel consumption intended for transport complies with the EU’s sustainability requirements. This paper investigates social preferences in Spain for sustainable biofuels and, in particular, the willingness to pay (WTP) for sustainable biodiesel. To do that, a choice experiment approach was used with data from a survey conducted in Zaragoza. Results indicate that consumers are willing to pay, a premium of 5% for biodiesel. This premium is slightly lower than the extra-price they are willing to pay for the convenience of finding biodiesel in their usual petrol station (6%). We identified two segments of consumers according to their WTP for the different biodiesel characteristics. One segment was more willing to pay for biodiesel while the other one attached more importance to fuelling convenience and biodiesel availability. © 2020, Bononia University Press.

AB  - Innovative breeds of sugar cane yield up to 2.5 times as much organic matter as conventional breeds, resulting in a great potential for biogas production. The use of biogas production as a complementary solution to conventional and second-generation ethanol production in Brazil may increase the energy produced per hectare in the sugarcane sector. Herein, it was demonstrated that through ensiling, energy cane can be conserved for six months; the stored cane can then be fed into a continuous biogas process. This approach is necessary to achieve year-round biogas production at an industrial scale. Batch tests revealed specific biogas potentials between 400 and 600 LN/kgVS for both the ensiled and non-ensiled energy cane, and the specific biogas potential of a continuous biogas process fed with ensiled energy cane was in the same range. Peak biogas losses through ensiling of up to 27% after six months were observed. Finally, compared with secondgeneration ethanol production using energy cane, the results indicated that biogas production from energy cane may lead to higher energy yields per hectare, with an average energy yield of up to 162 MWh/ha. Finally, the Farm-CBG concept is introduced, showing an approach for decentralized biogas production. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Energy security on islands is a challenging issue due to their isolation from energy markets and fossil fuel dependence. In addition, islands' average energy intensity has increased in recent years due to economic development. This research explores the environmental performance of two alternative non-variable bioelectricity feedstocks to increase energy resilience on islands. The study was developed for the Galapagos islands to address the environmental impacts from the direct use of waste cooking oil (WCO) and refined palm oil (RPO) to produce 1 MWh using the life cycle assessment methodological framework. A combination of primary and secondary data sources was used. The results show better performance for the electricity derived from WCO in all the impact categories considered when compared to RPO. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Nano and fine particles have caused serious health problems. Despite the continuous decline of their concentrations, the remaining amounts are still considered a problem in compression ignition engines. This study describes the impact of using biokerosene fuel instead of Iraqi diesel, which is characterised by high sulphur content, on the concentrations of various particulate matter (PM) sizes emitted from engines. A TD 313 Fiat diesel rig (a 4-stroke, 4-cylinder, water-cooled and direct injection engine) was used in the experimental tests. In addition to biofuel (produced from sunflower vegetable oil through a transformation process), Iraqi diesel and kerosene were also used. Four blends were produced, namely, diesel mixed with 10% and 20% volume fractions of biodiesel (denoted as BD 10 and BD 20, respectively) and kerosene added with 10% and 20% biofuel (labelled as KB10 and KB20, respectively). Fuelling the engine with biokerosene significantly reduced PM1.0 by up to 12.3%, 36.65%, 60.92% and 81% and PM2.5 by up to 21.29%, 25%, 41.43% and 51.85% for BD10, BD20, KD10 and KD20, respectively, compared with diesel at varying engine speed. Changing engine load at a constant speed reduced PM10 by up to 12.9%, 21%, 31.6% and 42.7% and total suspended particles by up to 5%, 12%, 21.5% and 25.5% for BD10, BD20, KD10 and KD20, respectively, compared with diesel. The concentrations of all PM sizes were reduced when engine was running at medium speed and load. By contrast, concentrations increased when engine was running at low and high loads and speeds. Results demonstrated that biokerosene is better than biodiesel–diesel blends in reducing PM emissions. © 2020 Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University

AB  - Recently, the research on conversion of biodiesel by-products to high value-added products has received much attention, due to the adverse effects of large accumulations of biodiesel by-products caused by the rapid increase in biodiesel production. Herein, this study investigated the utilization of by-products crude glycerol (CG-1 and CG-2) from two different industrial methods of biodiesel production and the favorable fermentation conditions for the high yield of β-farnesene by an engineered Escherichia coli F4, which harbored an optimized mevalonate pathway. Through analyzing by-products’ components and fermentation performance, we found that CG-2 did not contain harmful impurities such as methanol and black solid impurities, and the β-farnesene production was up to 2.7 g/L from CG-2, which was similar to that from pure glycerol (2.5 g/L) and higher than that (2.21 g/L) from CG-1. Therefore, CG-2 was more suitable for β-farnesene production than CG-1, which might provide a reference for choosing a more suitable method on practical biodiesel production. Afterward, a variety of important fermentation conditions were explored using CG-2 as a substrate in shaken flasks. Under the optimal conditions (including induced cell density 1.0, initial cell density 0.25, temperature after induction 33 °C, initial medium pH 6.5), the yield of β-farnesene from CG-2 reached 10.31 g/L in a 5-L bioreactor, which was 2.8-fold higher than initial conditions in shake flasks and was the highest yield of β-farnesene produced from biodiesel by-products by fermentation as well. The recommended fermentation conditions in this work will provide a valuable reference for the industrial production of β-farnesene utilizing biodiesel by-products. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Cyclopentanone (CPO) is a promising biofuel for spark-ignition engines due to its ring strain and high auto-ignition resistance. Understanding CPO decomposition is crucial for building a high-temperature combustion model. Here we present a comprehensive kinetic model for high-temperature pyrolysis of CPO with verified results from high-pressure shock tube (HPST) measurements. The time-histories of carbon monoxide (CO), ethylene (C2H4), and CPO absorbances over the temperature range of 1156–1416 K and pressure range of 8.53–10.06 atm were measured during current experiments. A corresponding detailed kinetic model was generated using the Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG) with dominant unimolecular/radical-involved decomposition pathways from either previous studies or quantum calculations within the current work. The obtained model containing 821 species and 79,859 reactions exhibited a good agreement with the experimental results. In this study, the absorbance ratio between C2H4 and CO was used as an important factor to validate models and to prove that radical-involved bimolecular pathways were as significant as unimolecular decomposition of CPO. The rate of production (ROP) analysis showed H radicals play a major role in the decomposition, and the whole decomposition process could be divided into three stages based on the H radical concentration. The insights from present work can be used to generate a better CPO combustion model and help evaluate CPO as an advanced biofuel. © 2020 The Combustion Institute

AB  - According to the report of the renewable energy policy network for the 21st century published in 2014, biodiesel and bioethanol are the most used biofuels and are responsible for transportation worldwide. Biodiesel specially has shown an increase in production globally by 15 times by volume from 2002 to 2012. Promising feedstock of biodiesel are cyanobacteria and microalgae as they possess a shorter cultivation time (4 fold lesser) and high oil content (10 fold higher) than corn, jatropha and soybean (conventional oil-producing territorial plants). Various valuable natural chemicals are also produced from these organisms including food supplements such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), pigments, and vitamins. Additionally, cellular components of microalgae and cyanobacteria are connected with therapeutic characteristics such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiviral and immune stimulating. Commercialization of algal biodiesel (or other products) can be achieved by isolating and identifying the high-yielding strains that possess a faster growth rate. Indigenous strains can be genetically engineered into high-yielding transgenic strains. The present article discusses about the use of nanotechnology and genetic engineering approach for improved lipid accumulation in microalgae for biodiesel production. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - Global warming and finite amount of oil resources have become serious issues. For this reason, the development of eco-friendly vehicles, using biofuel or oher materials has attracted significant attention. In particular, bioethanol has been focused on as an alternative to gasoline because it does not require a full-scale remodeling of a conventional internal combustion engine. However, the differences in the physical characteristics between gasoline and ethanol can lead to different spray characteristics, which can significantly affect the level of combustion. This study aims to identify the physical characteristics of an ethanol-gasoline blended fuel, including its viscosity, density and temperature by measuring the Sauter mean diameter (SMD) and applying a spray visualization. Through these experiments, basic data regarding the fuel characteristics and spray patterns according to the ethanol content required for an optimized combustion of an ethanol-gasoline blended fuel, are provided. © 2020, KSAE.

AB  - Developing effective, energy-efficient methods to extract lipids from microalgae remains a challenge in bioenergy. This study assesses electric pulse (EP) pretreatments to enhance lipid extraction from Chlorella protothecoides. In tandem with solvent extraction, we applied 10, 50, 100, 200, and 300 60 kV/cm, 60 ns duration EPs or 3, 17, 33, 67, and 100 60 kV/cm, 300 ns duration EPs to match the energy density u applied to the sample for each EP duration. Lipid recovery increased with increasing u for each EP duration until reaching a maximum for 17 300 ns EPs (the second lowest u) and 100 60 ns EPs (the third lowest u) to achieve a 13.3% and 16.1% increase in lipid extraction, respectively. Lipid extraction declined at higher u due to increased cell lysis. The largest net energy released calculated from the difference between the energy available from the extracted lipids and the applied energy of the EPs occurred at the lowest u for each EP duration. Applying trains of 100 μs EPs induced qualitatively similar behavior. These results suggest that a more detailed parametric study may optimize EP parameters for net energy release for specific microalgae and solvents. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.) is being developed as an oilseed cash cover crop for producing biofuels and value-added products as part of a sustainable carbonneutral future. An improved understanding of how pennycress embryos allocate photosynthate to biomass would help guide efforts to maximize and tailor seed oil production. To that end, Tsogtbaatar et al. (2020) fed pennycress embryos either 13C-labeled glucose or 13C-labeled glutamine, then quantified central carbon metabolism intermediates. Their data revealed that pennycress embryos are extremely efficient at converting substrates into biomass, due to key enzymatic activities that enable recapture of CO2, including the reversibility of isocitrate dehydrogenase and CO2 refixation by Rubisco. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Biodiesel is a well-established biofuel that contains unsaturated and saturated fatty esters, and their contents influence oxidation stability and solidification properties, respectively. Also, these properties can be aggravated during use after long-term storage. In this research, a new class of antioxidant/antifreeze bifunctional additives was developed by copolymerization of monomers containing an active site for addition reactions. Hydroquinone was added to these active sites after polymerization, and this chemical modification improved the performance of the additive as an antioxidant and pour point depressant of soybean oil biodiesel. This unique class of bifunctional additives was more soluble in biodiesel than hydroquinone and polymethacrylates at the same molar concentrations. The best performance was obtained by poly(oleyl acrylate-co-stearyl acrylate hydroquinone), which improved the pour point of neat biodiesel (B100) by 10 °C using a charge of just 1000 mg/kg. Also, hydroquinone performed as good as dodecyl acrylate as the pendent group, hindering crystal growth while improving B100 oxidation stability. Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A glycerol-derived biofuel with optimized composition to improve its cold-flow properties was tested in a C class Euro 6b vehicle on a chassis dynamometer following the worldwide harmonized light-duty vehicle test cycle at warm (24 °C) and cold (-7 °C) ambient conditions. The biofuel was previously blended at 20% v/v with a commercial diesel fuel, which was also tested pure as a reference for comparison. Regulated emissions were measured upstream of the aftertreatment system for an independent evaluation of the effect of the fuel. Previously the equivalence ratio and the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rate were analyzed to isolate the effect of these engine parameters from those of the type of fuel. The effect of the fuel used was minor in comparison with the effect of ambient temperature, with cold ambient temperature leading to much higher fuel consumption and gaseous emissions. CO emissions were observed to decrease with the biofuel only at warm ambient conditions, whereas no significant effects of the type of fuel were observed for CO at cold ambient conditions and for total hydrocarbon emissions at any condition. NOx emissions increased slightly at both ambient conditions, which was attributed to a slight decrease in the EGR rate. The main effect was found on particle emissions, which were reduced in both number and mass at both ambient temperatures. No startability problems were observed, even at cold ambient conditions. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Deoxygenation of fatty acids into liquid hydrocarbons is an efficient method of producing second-generation biofuels from biomass. Herein, we report efficient upgrading of stearic acid into a long-chain hydrocarbon at relatively low reaction temperature (140-220 °C) over a commercial Ru/C catalyst. The conversion process is predominantly through the hydrodecarboxylation pathway and not hydrodeoxygenation since heptadecane and not octadecane is found as the main product with the detection of CO2 in the gaseous products. The effects of process parameters including the solvent type (hexane, dodecane, isopropanol, water, and solvent-free), solvent volume, hydrogen pressure, catalyst loading, mass of feedstock, reaction temperature and reaction time on the conversion of stearic acid were systematically studied and optimized and the reusability of the catalyst was also studied. Hexane is found to be the most suitable solvent for the catalytic system. Under the optimized reaction conditions, 100% stearic acid conversion can be achieved at even 160 °C alongside a 90.1% yield of heptadecane. The apparent activation energy of the hydrodecarboxylation process over the commercial Ru/C catalyst was calculated to be 58.6 kJ mol-1. Notably, the reusability potential of the Ru/C catalyst is slightly limited by the accumulation of carbon deposits across multiple usage cycles. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.

AB  - Emulsification is a cost effective and simple method to use pyrolysis oil (or bio-oil) along with diesel as an emulsified fuel. Several combinations of emulsifiers, such as Span 80 and Atlox 4916, Span 80 and Zephrym PD3315, and Atlox 4916 and Zephrym PD3315, were tested to obtain stable emulsions. Two set of reactors (ultrasonicator and agitator-based mechanical reactor system) were used for the process. The ether-extracted pyrolysis oil (EEO), emulsifier, and diesel content of 10%–15%, 3%, and 82–87% were exposed to an ultrasonic power of 40% and with an agitation rate of 900 rpm. The emulsions obtained using Span 80 and Zephrym PD3315 showed stratification within 10 min. The emulsions for Span 80 and Atlox 4916 with a ratio of 3/15/82 for Emulsifer/EEO/Diesel, and for Atlox 4916 and Zephrym PD3315 emulsifiers with a ratio of 3/10/87 for Emulsifer/EEO/Diesel remained stable for more than 15 days. The functional groups analysis showed the stability of the emulsion for Span 80 and Atlox 4916, whereas a change in the absorbance intensity was observed when Atlox 4916 and Zephrym PD3315 were used, indicating stratification. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objective: Oleaginous yeasts are a renewable and alternative source of oil for third-generation biodiesel. This work aimed to evaluate the effects of glucose concentration (30–100 g L−1) on growth, lipid synthesis, and fatty acids (FA) profile of three Rhodotorula spp. (R. glacialis R15, R. glutinis R4, and R. glutinis R48) isolated from Antarctica, and estimate the key quality parameters of the biodiesel produced by yeasts to confirm their potential as feedstocks for third-generation biodiesel synthesis. Results: Yeasts accumulated 50–69.5% of lipids (w/w) under nitrogen-limitation and glucose-excess (C/N = 40–133). Glucose concentration increase influenced positively lipid accumulation (69.5% w/w) and FA profile of R. glacialis R15. Lipid accumulation (53% on average) of R. glutinis strains was not significantly affected by glucose concentration; content of saturated (~ 30%) and polyunsaturated FA (~ 29–30%) was slightly influenced. FA profiles of lipids synthesized by R15, R4, and R48 are similar to vegetable oils used in biodiesel industry with C16 and C18 FA (95–99%) as the major components, and contain mainly oleic (C18:1), palmitic (C16:0), and linoleic (C18:2) acids, which are suitable for biodiesel synthesis. Estimated fuel properties for biodiesel produced by R15, R4, and R48 satisfied all the criteria established by ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 with good cetane number, iodine value, and oxidation stability. An improvement in biodiesel quality of R15 was observed with the glucose increase. The best global properties of biodiesel from R4 were obtained with 30 g L−1 of glucose. Conclusions: Rhodotorula spp. from Antarctica are promising candidates for third-generation biodiesel synthesis. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - High-viscous neat neem oil (NO) with low-viscous wintergreen oil (WGO) may be used in diesel engines without any engine modification. Based on the previous experimental results, equal-volume blending of NO and WGO was prepared based on the optimum performance. The main aim of this experimental research is to improve the performance of NO–WGO blend using lower- and higher-order alcohol in terms of performance, emission and combustion parameters of the engine. All the experiments were conducted in a single-cylinder CI engine producing 5.2 kW power at a constant speed of 1500 rpm at variable loads. This research aims to compare the outcome of injection and blending of alcohol with NO and WGO blend at various load conditions. Alcohols, namely methanol, ethanol, hexanol and octanol, were identified and were injected in the inlet manifold along with intake air and also blended with the test fuels volumetrically. Based on the previous experimental results conducted with various injection rates of all the alcohols with NO50–WGO50, the optimum injection rate of each alcohol was identified on a mass basis based on the engine performance. Methanol, ethanol, hexanol and octanol blend and injection ratio was fixed at 30%, 30%, 20% and 10% on a mass basis. According to engine combustion, performance and emissions results, the injection of hexanol and octanol had the result of improving brake thermal efficiency, brake specific energy consumption and exhaust gas temperatures compared to other blends. The maximum pressure and heat release rate for all the hexanol and octanol alcohol injection blends were higher at higher loads. The HC, CO and smoke emissions were lower with Hex20 and Oct10 with NO50–WGO50 blends injection. The decrease in emissions is a result of homogeneous mixture formation within preinjected alcohols as well as air and lower volume of base fuel injected within the mixture. Finally, the NOx emissions increased with alcohol injection in comparison with blending with tested fuels. © 2019, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - The present study aims to study the effect of low viscous biofuel, namely pine oil (PO) and orange oil (O) blending with Jatropha methyl ester (JOME) along with exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) on NO-smoke tradeoff in a single-compression ignition (CI) engine. Two blends of pine oil and orange oil (30% by volume) with JOME were prepared and tested at 10%, 15%, and 20% EGR rates for various load conditions and compared with base fuels. JOME operation increased NO emission by 4% and reduced smoke opacity by 10% in comparison to diesel at maximum load condition. Poor physical properties of JOME, namely high viscosity and inferior volatility leads to reduced brake thermal efficiency with higher HC and CO emissions. Blends of JOME with low viscous biofuel reduces smoke emission with a further increase in NO emission in comparison to JOME as a result of combustion enhancement. Addition of EGR with JOME70 + PO30 and JOME70 + O30 aids in the reduction of NO emission with a slight increase in smoke opacity. Considering the NO-smoke tradeoff, JOME70 + O30 + EGR (10%) is optimum, NO emission is reduced by 14% and 11% in comparison to JOME and diesel and smoke opacity is reduced by 5% and 15% in comparison to JOME and diesel at maximum load, respectively. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Methanol is an organic compound commonly used as a solvent in the synthesis of fuel for internal combustion engines. However, the adulteration of fuels (biofuels and gasoline) with methanol is commonly practiced throughout world, and regulations to control the content of methanol in these fuels have been imposed. Although methanol in fuels can be analyzed by numerous analytical techniques, the traditional methods have some disadvantages, such as interferences, incomplete reactions, and lengthy analysis. Thus, the present work proposes a rapid and versatile methanol determination method using a simple derivatization of the sample with nicotinoyl chloride and subsequent fast analysis by ambient mass spectrometry using venturi easy ambient sonic-spray ionization (V-EASI-MS), without preseparation, taking into account all parameters of linearity, limits of detection, quantification, accuracy, and precision based on ISO 5725. We were able to develop a powerful method to quantify methanol in fuels which can be used as an alternative method to detect adulteration by government agencies. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Pyrolysis of nitrogen containing biofuels generates isocyanic acid (ICA) and we here studied if ICA also is present in cauterization smoke. Air sampling was performed when animal technicians that had developed airway symptoms worked with dehorning. Tissue heated in a laboratory model was used to mimic cauterization. ICA in air at the workplace exceeded 10 times the national exposure limit. In the laboratory, the ICA generated per mg tissue from heated hair, horn and nail was 13.9 ± 7.8, 24.0 ± 4.1 and 32.0 ± 2.9 µg, respectively. Three workers were medically examined and two were diagnosed with asthma and a third had severe airway problem that resembled asthma. The study shows that high levels of ICA are generated during cauterization of nitrogen-containing tissue. If this could trigger airway symptoms deserves to be investigated further. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The aim of this work is to study the influence of the physicochemical characteristics of neem seeds, according to their mass and oil content, on the production of biodiesel. After the physical characterization of the seeds and extraction of the oil (triglycerides), biodiesel was produced from crude neem seed oil by transesterification with ethanol in the presence of sodium hydroxide. This study shows that the physicochemical characteristics of these seeds vary according to the origin of the samples. The seeds from Zidim, with a mass average of 200 seeds evaluated at 141.36 g and an almond content of 40.70%, have better characteristics compared to those collected in the city of Maroua, with average values evaluated at 128.00 g and 36.05%, respectively. Almonds have an average lipid content of 53.98 and 56.75% for the Maroua and Zidim samples, respectively. This study also reveals that neem oil, by its physicochemical characteristics, has a satisfactory quality for a valorization in the production of biodiesel. However, its relatively high free fatty acid content is a major drawback, which leads to a low yield of biodiesel, evaluated on average at 89.02%, and requires a desacidification operation to improve this yield. The analysis of biodiesel indicates physicochemical characteristics close and comparable to those of petrodiesel, particularly in terms of calorific value, density, kinematic viscosity, acid value, evaluated at 41.00 MJ/kg, 0.803, 4.42 cSt, and 0.130 mg/g, respectively. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The continuous rising demands and fluctuations in the prices of fossil fuels warrant the search for an alternative renewable energy source to manage the present energy crisis. Thereby, ongoing research activities are actively engaged in developing an environmentally clean synthesis of biodiesel from agro-waste via an oleaginous bacterium process. A potent oleaginous bacterial strain has been isolated from poultry industry wastewater. On the basis of morphology, biochemical and 16S rRNA sequencing analysis, the strain has been identified as Bacillus cereus (MF 908505), which enables 3.1 g L-1 lipid productivity, and the satisfactory production of 5.1 g L-1 cell dry weight with 36% (w/w) lipid content using pomegranate waste-peel as a substrate. 37 °C temperature, 7% carbon source and 140 rpm agitation speed with a 72 h incubation period are found to be the optimum lipid production conditions. Lipids are then extracted and transesterified under the optimized reaction conditions using 0.2% Ca(OH)2 as a base catalyst and a 1 : 6 bacterial oil to methanol ratio, at 70 °C for 90 min reaction time, which, under these conditions, enables an 85% fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield. The esterified FAMEs were subjected to gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) measurements, revealing the presence of benzenesulphonic acid methyl esters and methyl esters, thus, doubtlessly, supporting the formation of biodiesel. The resulting FAMEs were characterized further by means of various tools and the properties of the obtained biodiesel were found to match those of standard biodiesel, i.e. ASTM D6751. These results suggest the potential suitability of Bacillus cereus (MF 908505) lipids for use as an agro-waste substrate in the biodiesel conversion process.

AB  - Jatropha curcas is one of the major sources of renewable energy due to potential use of its oil as a biofuel. The genome of this crop is constituted by the high content of repetitive elements. We employed the Hi-C proximity ligation technique to re-scaffold our existing hybrid genome assembly of an elite genotype (RJC1) developed using Illumina and Pacbio technologies. We assembled 99.81% of non-truncated reads to achieve 266.80 Mbp of the genome with an N50 value of 1.58 Mb. Furthermore, we compared the efficiency of Hi-C-augmented genome assembly with the hybrid genome assembly and observed a ~ 50% reduction in scaffolds and a tenfold increase in the N50 value. The gene ontology analysis revealed the identification of terms for molecular function (45.52%), cellular component (33.47%), and biological function (20.99%). Comparative genomic analysis of 13-plant species showed the conservation of 414 lipid metabolizing genes identified in the KEGG pathway analysis. Differential gene expression (DGE) studies were conducted in the healthy and Jatropha mosaic virus-infected leaves via RNA-seq analysis and observed gene expression changes for 2185 genes. Out of these, we observed 546 genes having more than two-fold change of transcript level and among these 259 genes were down-regulated and 287 genes were up-regulated. To validate RNA-seq data, two DEGs were selected for gene expression analysis using qRT-PCR and the data was in correlation with in silico results. RNA-seq analysis further shows the identification of some of the candidate genes and may be useful to develop JMV resistant plants after functional validation. This Hi-C genome assembly provides a detailed accurate reference genome which could be utilized to improve Jatropha and other economically important Euphorbiaceae family members. © 2020, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology.

AB  - The pretreatment of biomass and the subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis to sugars play an important role in the production of biofuels from lignocellulosic biomass. However, the influence of pretreatment and hydrolysis yields on the production pathway performance of biofuels is rarely researched from the beginning. Moreover, a clear trade-off between economic efficiency and environmental impact exists. Production pathways can be evaluated with reaction network flux analysis (RNFA) (Voll A and Marquardt W, Reaction network flux analysis: Optimization-based evaluation of reaction pathways for biorenewables processing. AIChE J 58(6):1788–1801 (2012)). Utilizing RNFA, this study explores the influence of biomass pretreatment, focusing on changes in biomass composition, fractionation efficiency, and sugar yield after hydrolysis on the production performance of biofuels for several pretreatment concepts and several wood sources. The results show that, for ethanol and ethyl levulinate production, specific fuel costs and carbon loss correlate reciprocally with the yields of pretreatment and hydrolysis. For a constant biofuel output, the main cost driver is the feed stream of biomass, which decreases with an improved overall sugar yield after pretreatment. Furthermore, above a threshold value, specific fuel costs increase strongly with carbon loss. As a result, a minimal yield of 40% carbohydrates from wood seems to be the limit of viable production in the processes that were considered. We therefore developed a facile strategy to assess the performance of pretreatment and hydrolysis in biomass processing © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - In this work, production of hydrocarbon fuel from Mahua oil has been characterised for diesel engine application, by appraising essential fuel processing parameters. As opposed to traditional trans-esterification process, the reported oil was identified by using heterogeneous catalysts, as the latter improves the fuel properties better than the former. Therefore, interest has been taken in utilising heterogeneous catalyst such as Coal fly ash (CFA) for biofuel production process. From the experimental investigation it was observed that performance results such as BTE for B25 blend show marginally lower value to sole fuel at all loads and NOx emission for B100 blend exhibit significantly lower value than sole fuel. Smoke emission for B25 show the increasing trend that of other blends. However, CO, HC emission for B25 shows the marginal increases when compared to the sole fuel and the combustion analysis of B25 blend showed almost similar trend of sole fuel. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Fuel scarcity and environmental pollution associated with global warming are the major threats encountered by the operation of off-road vehicles, such as agricultural tractors and construction equipment. Biofuels from locally available resources and waste materials can contribute toward handling this ecological issue. In this work, an attempt has been made to study the performance, combustion, and emission characteristics of a Simpson S217, twin-cylinder tractor diesel engine using soapnut oil methyl ester as fuel. Soapnuts were purchased from organic shops, and oil was extracted by the cold-press method from soapnut kernels. The extracted oil was further subjected to the transesterification process with the presence of KOH and methanol to separate glycerin and fatty acids. Various proportions of soapnut oil methyl ester and diesel were blended on a volumetric basis. The properties of resulting blends SNB10, SNB20, and SNB30 satisfied ASTM biodiesel standards. Experimental investigations were carried out to study the effect of these blends on fuel consumption, thermal efficiency, cylinder pressure, exhaust gas temperature, and tail pipe emissions. The results revealed that the use of biodiesel blends reduced carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, and smoke emissions with a slight increase in the NOx emission compared to diesel. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Researchers and federal and state agency officials have long been interested in evaluating location-specific impact of bioenergy energy crops on water quality for developing policy interventions. This modeling study examines long-term impact of giant miscanthus and switchgrass on water quality in the Cache RiverWatershed (CRW) in Arkansas, United States. The bioenergy crops were simulated on marginal lands using two variants of a Soil andWatershed Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The first SWAT variant was developed using a static (single) land-use layer (regular-SWAT) and for the second, a dynamic land-use change feature was used with multiple land use layers (location-SWAT). Results indicated that the regular-SWAT predicted larger losses for sediment, total phosphorus and total nitrogen when compared to location-SWAT at the watershed outlet. The lower predicted losses from location-SWAT were attributed to its ability to vary marginal land area between 3% and 11% during the 20-year modeling period as opposed to the regular-SWAT that used a fixed percentage of marginal land area (8%) throughout the same period. Overall, this study demonstrates that environmental impacts of bioenergy crops were better assessed using the dynamic land-use representation approach, which would eliminate any unintended prediction bias in the model due to the use of a single land use layer. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Copper mining in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in the mid-19th century generated millions of tons of mining waste, called stamp sand, which was deposited into various offshoots of Lake Superior. The toxic stamp sand converted the area into barren, fallow land. Without a vegetative cover, stamp sand has been eroding into the lakes, adversely affecting aquatic life. Our objective was to perform a greenhouse study, to grow cold-tolerant oilseed crops camelina (Camelina sativa) and field pennycress (Thlaspi arvense) on stamp sand, for the dual purpose of biofuel production and providing a vegetative cover, thereby decreasing erosion. Camelina and field pennycress were grown on stamp sands in columns, using compost to supply nutrients. A greenhouse study in wooden panels was also done to evaluate the effectiveness of camelina in reducing erosion. Results show that camelina significantly reduced erosion and can also be used commercially for generating biodiesel. A 25-fold reduction in Cu content in the surface run-off was observed in the panels with camelina compared to those of the control. Stamp sand-grown camelina seeds contained 20% and 22.7% oil and protein respectively, and their fatty acid composition was similar to previous studies performed on uncontaminated soils. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of levulinic acid (LA) aldol condensation product dimers was studied between 250 and 300 °C and 50 bar H2 in a batch reactor with Ru catalyst supported on mesoporous zirconia. During the reaction, the unsaturated dimers, which contained ketone groups and double bonds, were hydrogenated to saturated dimers. A greater degree of deoxygenation was achieved at higher temperatures, and oxygen was removed as water and CO2. Oxygen removal was evidenced by elemental analysis and infrared spectroscopy, in which the C=O peak decreased with increasing temperature. A drawback of high reaction temperature (300 °C) was a minor degree of oligomerization. The formation of aromatics was also observed at the higher temperatures. Aside from the saturated dimers, volatile products were obtained at all temperatures, including ketones, acids, and esters. This study demonstrates for the first time the potential of LA dimers as a sustainable route from lignocellulosic biomass to biofuels and biocomponents. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - This paper reports new results about the combustion dynamics of hydroprocessed renewable jet fuel droplets derived from heterotrophic algae (AHRJ) burning under conditions that promote one-dimensional transport dynamics and near spherically symmetric burning conditions. Results are compared between Jet-A and three AHRJ/Jet-A mixtures containing 25, 50, and 75% AHRJ by volume. The results show that AHRJ droplets burn slightly faster than Jet-A and have a significantly reduced sooting propensity. Detailed chemical analysis also shows that AHRJ contains virtually no aromatics while the aromatic content of Jet-A was 16% by volume. The influence of composition on the burning rate is explained using a simple scaling argument that illustrates the importance of liquid density and other properties. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Concerns on environmental change, high-energy costs, and diminishing oil reserves have compelled a robust interest for the exploration of alternative energy sources. Current study was aimed to prepare biodiesel from waste cooking oil collected from restaurant and domestic kitchen, and to compare their fuel properties. To obtain high yield of biodiesel, some important variables such as methanol to oil ratio, catalyst concentration, and reaction temperature were varied. Results showed that highest yield of biodiesel was obtained at 1.5% catalyst concentration by restaurant oil at 6:1 methanol/oil at 65°C. Acid value, free fatty acid content, specific gravity, and kinematic viscosity were in accordance to ASTM standards. Cloud and pour point for both the oils was less than 14°C. Flash point and cetane index of restaurant biodiesel samples were according to the standards proposed by ASTM. Restaurant waste oil biodiesel showed better fuel properties as compared to domestic waste oil and can be suggested as an effective environmental-friendly source for biodiesel production. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Laser derivatization is proposed as a diagnostic technique toward identifying the sources contributing to combustion produced soot. Fuel chemistry and the resultant oxygen content in nascent soot have been shown to influence the evolution of soot nanostructure upon laser derivatization. This is illustrated using the spectroscopic and microscopic characterization of biodiesel soot, with a systematic variation in fuel chemistry used to generate the soot. Functionalized carbon black is used as the control to independently verify the influence of material chemistry on nanostructure upon laser heat treatment. Results track with those observed for biodiesel soot. Reciprocally, the similarity in soot nanostructure observed after laser heating is tied to the likeness in fuel chemistry of biomass-fueled sources. Understanding the origin of differences or similarities in soot nanostructure upon laser heat treatment can help differentiate sources based on their contribution, thereby aiding in effective air quality control.

AB  - There has been an increased interest as regards the use of biofuels in aviation gas turbine engines due to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions along with fluctuating jet fuel prices. This work researches the use of soap-derived biokerosene (SBK) in aircraft engines. SBK is a promising biofuel option for emerging tropical countries as its production requires a relatively simple technology, and its feedstock sources are abundant in these countries. Blends of Jet A-1 with up to 20 vol.% SBK were tested on a 1S/60 Rover gas turbine engine over a range of brake powers to measure engine performance and emissions. The results were then compared to those of pure Jet A-1. It shows that the engine running on SBK/Jet A-1 blends and pure Jet A-1 have almost similar engine performance parameters including engine efficiency, specific fuel consumption (SFC), turbine inlet temperature (TIT), and exhaust gas temperature (EGT). On the other hand, increasing the volume fraction of SBK in the fuel blends with Jet A-1 leads to a slight increase in carbon monoxide (CO) and HC emissions, while insignificant differences in the nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions were found. From this study, some valuable recommendations could be found to improve the feasibility of SBK for use as an alternative aviation fuel. © 2020 The Authors. Published by SAE International.

AB  - Excessive use of fossil fuel results in a rapid depletion of non-renewable fossil energy resources, a rise in fuel cost and an uncontrolled emission of greenhouse gases, which causes a severe threat to the environment. This critical state has turned the awareness to explore renewable energy resources, which include water, biomass, wind and geothermal heat. Among these possibilities, biomass based fuels, i.e. biofuels, have been proposed as a substitute for conventional diesel and gasoline. The biofuels burn cleanly, thereby reducing harmful emissions, especially in the form of carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbon and toxic chemicals. This work aims at revealing the current state-of-the-art and the challenges in the application of integrated membrane bioreactors (MBRs) in biofuel production. This innovative technology is employed for production of biofuels in gaseous and liquid state, such as biohydrogen, bio crude oil, bioethanol and biodiesel. Great opportunities for producing combustible gas mixtures open up broad prospects for integrated systems, and the low energy intensity makes them attractive for industrial developments. Coupling of bio processes and membrane filtration allows to solve the problem of producing methane and hydrogen without emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The main advantage of a MBR system is that it can be applied using environmentally friendly technology, i.e. biotechnology based on natural processes and mechanisms of conversion of substances by enzymes and microbial cultures. The waste and by-products of these processes can also serve as additional sources of raw materials, which leads to completely waste-free production. © 2020. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - The use of biofuels to replace fossil fuels as well as more stringent emission regulations for internal combustion engines cause a challenge for the engine manufacturers to build engines that can cope with a wide range of fuels, but still offer low exhaust emissions with no detriment to performance. In this work a test bed with a compression ignition engine has been used to measure emissions when using a ternary fuel blend between diesel, biodiesel and ethanol together with exhuast gas recirculation (EGR) and different fuel delivery techniques. EGR with biofuels have the potential to significantly reduce NOx over conventional diesel combustion. The fuel used, B2E9 achieves a 10% renewable content as set out in the UK government’s Renewable Energy Directive. Most studies reported in the literature evaluates emissions reduction technologies by only changing one factor-at-a-time at steady state conditions. This paper addresses these issues and presents a methodology utilising a Central Composite Design (CCD) analysis to optimise four engine parameters which include EGR percentage, main injection SOI, pilot injection SOI and pilot injection open duration over a transient drive cycle (WLTP) which makes the results more applicable to real world driving conditions. The optimisation of the CCD showed that NOx emissions decreases by 25% when the maximum exhaust gas recirculation is set to 45%, the main injection is retarded by 2 CADs, the pilot injection dwell time is set to 21 CADs and 24% of the fuel is delivered through the pilot injection. CO emissions increase by approximately 47% as a result of the decrease in NOx emissions. © IMechE 2020.

AB  - In recent years, diesel engine researchers have turned onto alternative fuel due to international emission legislations and depletion of fossil fuels. Natural gas and biofuels as an alternative fuel have gained popularity with simple and low-cost utilization in diesel engines. In the present study, effect of compressed natural gas (CNG) application with pilot injection of waste frying oil biodiesel (WFOB) blends have been investigated on performance and emissions of a diesel engine running under full load at 3000 rpm speed. Engine tests have been carried out according to ISO 8178 E2 test cycle, at maximum rated power for 0%, 20%, 40%, and 60% substitution ratios of CNG and 0%, 10%, 20% of WFOB content in pilot diesel fuel. It is found that, in dual fuel mode; ignition delay period is longer than the standard diesel operation, and in dual fuel mode; thermal efficiency is lower than the standard diesel operation. Moreover, a significant reduction is observed in nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission and smoke opacity with an increase of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions. With the use of pilot WFOB blends, ignition delay period becomes shorter. NOx emissions increase, while CO, HC emissions, and smoke opacity decrease. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The present study focuses on the determination of oil contents of thirteen different jatropha seed collections from Ethiopia. The oil was extracted with a Soxhlet extractor using n-hexane which was selected out of four different solvents: diethyl ether, ethanol, n-heptane, and n-hexane. Cotton and thimble were used as filter for the extractions. Some properties of the oil of Chali seed collection and a sample of mixed oils (a mixture of equal volume of oils from thirteen different seed collections) were determined. The energy contents of selected de-oiled jatropha seed residues were also estimated. In the extraction with cotton and thimble, the largest percentage of oil yield was obtained from Dana seed (48.29%) and Chali seed (45.79) collections, respectively. The acid value (1.32 mg KOH/g) and percentage of free fatty acids (%FFA) (0.66%) of Chali seed oil were lower than the acid value (2.12 mg KOH/g) and %FFA (1.06%) of the mixed oil, and thus, the former oil is more suitable for alkaline-catalyzed biodiesel production. The iodine values of both Chali seed oil (116.02 g/100 g) and mixed oil (109.24 g/100 g) did not exceed the maximum standard for biodiesel according to the European EN 14214 specification, and the oils could be used for biodiesel production. The gross calorific values of de-oiled jatropha seed residues after oil extraction were found to range from 18.57 to 24.03 MJ/kg, and with the average value of 19.64 MJ/kg. Thus, the de-oiled seed residues can be used as the source of heat. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - In the present paper, the performance evaluation of a variable compression ratio single-cylinder engine with 20% blend of microalgae biodiesel with petro–diesel is presented. Microalgae biodiesel is prepared at the laboratory scale from microalgae oil (Schizochytrium sp.), and its evaluated physical and chemical properties are observed to be comparable with petro–diesel. Further, it was observed that at a comparable compression ratio there is no significant performance variation between petro–diesel and its blended version that contains 20% of microalgae biodiesel. In addition to that, the experiment results show a reduction in the CO, un-burnt HC and smoke emissions with biodiesel blend as compared to petro–diesel fuel. Keeping the above points into consideration, it can be said that the promotion of microalgae biodiesel for 20% blending with petro–diesel for use in existing diesel engines should be taken up. Thus, the target set to be achieved by present Indian biofuel policy of blending 5% biodiesel with petro–diesel in the existing diesel engines by 2030 seems to be on the lower side and should be considered for the upward revision. © 2020, The Institution of Engineers (India).

AB  - The Ni-ZSM-5 catalyst, under four different factors of Swida wilsoniana pyrolysis products of catalytic hydrogenation, GC-MS, FI-IR, and elemental analyzers, was used to identify the elements, carbon chain distribution, and composition of the products. The effects of reaction temperature, reaction pressure, and catalyst hydrogenation level on the conversion rate were investigated. The reaction pressure and the amount of catalyst are the main factors that affect the conversion of the pyrolysis products into biofuels. Using 1.05 wt.% Ni-ZSM-5 catalyst, the highest conversion rate was 98.10% at 173°C and 2.00 MPa. The results show that Swida wilsoniana-decomposed products can be converted to high-quality biofuels by catalytic hydrogenation of Ni-ZSM-5 and can be used as an alternative energy source. © 2020 Aihua Zhang et al.

AB  - Residual lipids with high fatty acid content represent an important source of raw material for renewable biofuels. They are not suitable for the production of biodiesel via alkaline transesterification but can be converted to biodiesel via esterification. For these feedstocks, hydrodeoxygenation is suitable for producing hydrocarbons. However to limit hydrogen consumption, thermal processes are also object of studies. In these thermal processes nickel has been used in the form of supported catalysts but has not been well studied in the form of mixed oxides. This work aims at studying the Ni/Al ratio influence on the properties of unsupported mixed oxides prepared from layered double hydroxides (LDH) precursors, to evaluate their performance in the fast pyrolysis of myristic acid (MA) as a model compound of residual acidic lipids. Prepared materials had molar ratios Ni/Al = 0.3, 1 and 3. The catalysts were obtained through calcination of the precursors, and were characterized by XRD, TGA, FTIR, N2 adsorption isotherms, TPD of NH3 and EDX analysis. Myristic acid pyrolysis, with catalyst:MA mass ratio of 5:1, was carried out in a micropyrolyzer at 550 °C, and the products were analyzed through online GC/MS. Results show that the obtained catalysts presented a rather high surface area, important mesoporosity and NiO and NiAl2O4 crystalline phases. The catalysts with the highest Al content favored cracking with the production of hydrocarbons in the gasoline range, while the sample with highest Ni content favored the production of hydrocarbons in the kerosene range. The catalyst obtained with the combination of Ni/Al = 1 presented the highest surface area and acidity and the lowest NiO crystallite size, resulting in the best MA conversion (∼84 %) and deoxygenation degree. It also produced the highest yield in aromatic compounds due to the higher acidity and hydrogen transfer, compared to other catalysts. The present results confirm that catalytic reaction under pyrolysis conditions is able to identify some intrinsic properties of catalysts using model molecules as starting feed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Current research talks about the extraction of green crude from algae using fast pyrolysis, comparison of properties of biofuel derived from various feedstocks, analysis of biofuels using multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method, performance on Variable Compression Ratio(VCR) engine. 2.11mm2/sec (kinematic viscosity at 400C) of biodiesel is cause ease in atomization of fuel in engine and hence better thermal efficiency(ƞthb) and lower value of BSFC is observed. Analysis using MCDM proves algae biodiesel as best among the other feedstock. The fast pyrolyser is designed for the derivation of green crude from any feedstock. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) technique having a set of large numbers of runs is adapted to gain analytical results very close to the actual performance tests. The result for B0, B20, and B40 shows, the lowest value of BSFC of 0.34kg/kWh, the highest value of ƞthb = 27.59% and the highest value of mechanical efficiency = 48.56% are achieved at B20, with CR 17, the injection pressure of 200bar and at full load i.e. at 11kg-f. Thus algae biodiesel as a cleaner and greener fuel is proven as a futuristic fuel for the automobile and power generation sector. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In search of alternative and eco-friendly sources of fuel, biofuel received enormous attention over the world. Although Bangladesh is a land of biomass and natural resources, an intensive study of the potential use of these resources for biofuel production has not yet been reported. Shorea robusta, commonly known as ‘Sal tree’, is the major plant of Sal forest which covers about 10% of the total forest land of Bangladesh. In this study, fuel properties of the seeds obtained from Sal tree were assessed from its proximate and ultimate analysis. Oil from Sal seed was extracted via solvent extraction process using n-hexane as solvent. The oil content in the seed was found 15.39% (when the coat and kernel of the seeds extracted together) and 20.16% (when only Kernel of the seeds was extracted), respectively. GC-FID analysis of the oil detected the presence of stearic acid (49.38%), oleic acid (34.69%), arachidic acid (8.56%), and palmitic acid (7.35%). The elemental composition of the oil was found C = 75.9%, H = 13.5%, N = 3.6%, S = 0.06%. Different physico-chemical parameters e.g., acid value, iodine value, saponification value, peroxide value, refractive index, and viscosity of the oil were also determined. The higher heating value of the Sal seed and its oil were found 17.99 MJ/kg and 41.61 MJ/kg, respectively. The pyrolysis and the combustion characteristics of the seed and extracted oil were evaluated via Thermogravimetric Analysis. The Sal seed and its oil would be a promising feedstock for commercial biodiesel, pyro-oil, and soap production in Bangladesh. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the design point performance of a custom engine via GasTurb software. In this study, a turbojet engine model is simulated without afterburners and limited to design point (DP) simulation at a speed of 15,000 rpm. The input parameters such as pressure ratio (PR) for the main components, the mechanical and burner efficiency, and isotropic PR for compressor and turbine have been identified for a custom engine as a design point. The results compared at different levels of the condition using GasTurb-13 and GSP-11 software. It was found that each software was able to provide similar results at various conditions tested. There are small differences in the values for the fuel flow and specific fuel consumption. Also, the same results were obtained at the baseline point. Furthermore, the heating value has a primary effect on specific fuel consumption. It was also found that the optimal thrust value was at 34.2 kN, and the best value for optimal specific fuel consumption was 20.9 g/kN.s. The main factors affecting biofuel properties are calorific value and viscosity. When the calorific value of the fuel is reduced, the thrust FN and specific fuel consumption increase. For example, Methanol and Ethanol recorded the highest amount of fuel consumption, which is 54.72 g/KN. s and 47.56 g/(KN. s), respectively. This is because they have the highest mass fuel flow (1.79 kg/s for Methanol, and 1.54 kg/s for Ethanol) than other types of fuel, while the mass fuel flow for green diesel (0.78 kg/s) was lower than other fuels, so its specific fuel consumption (22.11 g/(KN. s) was lesser than other fuels. © 2020 PENERBIT AKADEMIA BARU.

AB  - This study suggests a solution to a substantial dilemma in Iraqi society. The pollutants resulted from Kerosene combustion in the stonemasonry ovens, which emits variable types of pollutants to the air and products. Biofuels produced from edible food wastes have been added to kerosene at different percentages to reduce toxicity levels, most notably the lead portion in kerosene. The results of the study show that the kerosene-biofuel blends are clean and free of lead and sulfur compounds, in addition to the availability of production potential. The use of food wastes in the production of biofuels is an economical solution to waste accumulation. The study was conducted on a stone kiln in Baghdad. Lead ratios were measured in kerosene samples and different proportions of kerosene-biofuels blends. The samples produced in the oven and two cases of the initial and final baking process were also analyzed. The results revealed that the process of mixing biofuels with kerosene reduces the proportion of lead, which is directly proportional to the proportion of biofuels, accompanied by an increase in the relative baking time (ineffective) due to the different calorific value of biofuels. © 2020 PENERBIT AKADEMIA BARU.

AB  - The effect of water injection at the air side and water addition at fuel side on en-gine’s performance of a Diesel engine was studied under oxygen enriched intake air using neat mahua oil as fuel. Initially experiments were carried out using neat mahua oil as fuel with different oxygen concentrations such as 21% (ambient), 22.4%, 23.8%, and 24.7% by volume at the air side. The optimal oxygen concen-tration was found based on the engine’s brake thermal efficiency. At the optimal oxygen concentration water injection was done on air side at 4% by mass and the experiments were repeated with neat mahua oil as fuel under oxygen enrichment mode. Finally, mahua oil emulsion was prepared using the same amount of water (i. e. 4%) and tested in the engine. A comparative study was made for the same amount of water (i. e. 4% as optimal) for water injection and neat mahua oil emul-sion on engines behavior. Oxygen enrichment increased the brake thermal effi-ciency with all concentrations and reached the maximum value from 25.2% with ambient oxygen to a maximum of 30.6% at 23.8% of oxygen enrichment at the maximum brake mean effective pressure of 5.4 bar whereas it was 30.8% with neat diesel. The smoke, HC, and CO emissions were significantly reduced with oxygen enrichment. However, oxygen enrichment increased the NO emissions at all con-centrations. Injection of water and emulsification techniques reduced the NO emis-sions considerably. Emulsification showed more reduction in NO emission than water injection for the same amount of water. It was concluded from the study that neat mahua oil could be effective used as fuel in compression ignition engines by combusting it under oxygen enriched condition. The optimal oxygen concentration of 23.8% could be recommended for the highest brake thermal efficiency. Injection of water at the intake manifold and emulsification techniques could solve the prob-lem of higher NO emissions. The optimal amount of water that could be injected without affecting the engines power and brake thermal efficiency could be recom-mended as 4% by volume. Emulsification has the added advantage of further im-provement in engine’s brake thermal efficiency. © 2020 Society of Thermal Engineers of Serbia.

AB  - Background: Biodiesel, as a green and renewable biofuel, has great potential to replace fossil diesel. The development of efficient and stable heterogeneous catalysts is vital to produce bio-diesel in an efficient and green way. Nanocatalysts provide a high surface-to-volume ratio as well as high active site loading and can improve mass transfer, which is beneficial to enhance their catalytic activity. Objective: The review focuses on the latest advances in the production of biodiesel using nanostruc-tured catalysts. Methods: Biodiesel is mainly produced through esterification and transesterification reaction using acids, bases or lipases as catalysts. We mainly review the synthesis methods and physicochemical properties of various basic, acidic and lipase nanocatalysts. Meanwhile, their catalytic activities in biodiesel production are also discussed. Results: Alkali nanocatalysts are mainly suitable for transformation of oils with low acid values to biodiesel via transesterification reaction. In contrast, acidic nanocatalysts are not sensitive to water as well as free fatty acids and can avoid saponification associated with basic nanocatalysts while pro-mote simultaneous esterification and transesterification reaction. However, acid-catalyzed trans-esterification usually requires harsh reaction conditions. In addition, the lipase-catalyzed process is also suitable for non-edible oils containing high contents of free fatty acids, which possess environmental and economic advantages. Conclusion: Nanocatalysts have many advantages such as good accessibility with nanostructure, high active site loading and reduction of mass transfer resistance. However, most of those materials undergo deactivation after several cycles. Therefore, the development of more efficient, stable, and low-cost nanocatalysts is desirable for producing biodiesel. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Increased energy consumption leads to a reduction in limited nonrenewable resources called fossil fuels. Due to this fact, researchers look for alternative energy sources to satisfy the need of the current generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. As a result, nowadays the production of energy from biological sources is highly applicable and takes advantage of fossil fuel due to the limited impact on the environment. On the other hand, food cost, land use for some other purposes, and carbon emissions have risen due to the increased production of first-generation bioethanol. Even though the second-generation bioethanol from lignocellulose agricultural waste solved this problem, it again faced difficulties-to-overcome technological barriers. This, in turn, pushed researchers to come up with another alternative called the third-generation biofuel production. The renewed promise is held in microalgae biomass as an alternative feedstock. This review deals with the important aspects of biofuel production from algae as a renewable resource. The production processes and their merits and demerits of algae capacity in producing biofuel are also discussed. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Biofuels are fuels produced from hydrocarbon rich living organisms such as plants or microalgae by thermal chemical or biochemical conversion process. Biofuels such as biodiesel, biogas and syngas are combusted to generate energy. Biodiesel is an ecofriendly and an alternate of renewable diesel fuel. It is defined as an alternative fuel for diesel engines produced by chemically reacting a vegetable oil or animal fat with an alcohol such as methanol or mono-Alkyl esters of long chain fatty acids derived from a renewable lipid feed stock. It is typically produced by reacting the fatty acids with alcohol in the presence of catalyst to produce the desired mono-Alkyl esters and glycerol. After reaction, the glycerol, catalyst, and any remaining alcohol or fatty acids are removed from the mixture. The alcohol used in the reaction is typically methanol, although ethanol and higher alcohols have been used also. The majority of the biodiesel currently produced is made from soybean oil and this soya biodiesel consists of the five methyl esters. While neat (i.e., 100%) biodiesel can be used, a blend of between 2 and 20% (by volume) of biodiesel with petro-diesel fuel is recommended to avoid engine-compatibility problems. With a flash point of 160°C, it is classified as non-flammable, biodegradable and non-Toxic fuel. Biodiesel has emits much lower emissions than petro diesel and it can also be mixed with petro diesel to reduce emissions. For example B20 is a fuel containing 20% biodiesel and 80% petro diesel. Pure biodiesel is B100. Biodiesel reduces carbon dioxide emissions by 78%, and carbon monoxide emissions by 50%. It also does not have sulphur emissions. The purpose of this work is to study the development of biodiesel process at pilot plant scale using plant origin oil as the raw material with methanol and sodium hydroxide as the catalyst and evaluate the produced biodiesel as a fuel. It may lead to a revolutionary transformation of the current economic and energy scenario with an era of economic bloom and prosperity for our society. © 2020 Plant Archives. All rights reserved.

AB  - The growing global demand for fossil fuels and considerable environmental threats and risks have prompted researchers to launch investigations over some renewable energy sources in recent years. Especially biodiesel and ethanol have been considered as major alternative fuels as they are derived from renewable sources. These fuels are well oxygenated and therefore have a great potential to reduce emissions. Biodiesel, which is chemically derived from edible oils or animal fats by transesterification reaction, is esters of long-chain saturated/unsaturated fatty acids and can be an important alternative fuel source to consider for the vehicle. It can offer desirable features to diesel engines, and internal combustion engines (ICEs) in particular. The present study aims at determining and assessing the effect of the engine’s load and speed as well as various ratios of diesel and biodiesel fuels blending on the emissions of pollutants from the OM 314 diesel engine. Design Expert 11 statistical software was used. Second-order models obtained using response surface methodology (RSM) to predict the effect of input variables on response surfaces were statistically significant at an alpha level of 1. Following an increase in the percentage of biodiesel compared to pure diesel fuel, the HC (Hydrocarbons) emission rate decreased. According to the optimization results, the lowest HC emission rate (33.52 ppm), and the least NOX emission rate occurs when using 8.82% biodiesel. The lowest HC emission rate was observed after using pure biodiesel fuel. Following an increase in the percentage of biodiesel in the blended fuel, the NOX emission rate increased, while the lowest emission rate was observed after using pure diesel fuel. Engine smoke flow rate decreased after increasing the percentages of biodiesel in blended fuel compared to diesel fuel. A higher percentage of biodiesel was considered as the most effective way to reduce the rate of smoke opacity. According to the multi-objective optimization (MOO) results, the lowest HC, and NOX emission rates and the rate of smoke opacity was observed for blended fuel “D32.47B67.53” with the Desirability of 60% under applying a load of 41.36% and rotational speed of 1383 rpm. © 2020 by Japan Oil Chemists’ Society.

AB  - Background: Liquid C8-C15 long-chain alkanes, as the main components of jet fuels or diesel, can be synthetized from abundant and renewable biomass derivatives by extending the car-bon-chain length through cascade C-C coupling over acidic catalysts and hydrodeoxygenation over metal particles. Objective: This research aims to develop a carbon-increasing catalytic process through the dimeriza-tion of 5-methylfurfuryl alcohol to produce the C11 oxygenate bis(5-methylfuran-2-yl) methane. Methods: In this work, 5-methylfurfural, derivable from sugars, could be reduced to the expensive 5-methylfurfuryl alcohol over Cs2 CO3 using an eco-friendly hydride polymethylhydrosiloxane. In the subsequent carbon-increasing process, a solid acidic nanocatalyst 3-chlorpyridine phosphotungstic acid (3-ClPYPW) was developed to be efficient for the conversion of 5-methylfurfuryl alcohol to bis(5-methylfuran-2-yl) methane under mild reaction conditions. Results: A good bis(5-methylfuran-2-yl) methane yield of 51.6% was obtained using dichloro-methane as a solvent at a low temperature of 70°C in 11 h. The solid nanocatalyst was able to be reused for at least four cycles without a remarkable loss of catalytic activity. The kinetic study proved that the reaction is a first-order reaction with apparent activation energy (Ea) of 41.10 kJ mol-1, while the thermodynamic study certified that the reaction is non-spontaneous and endother-mic. Conclusion: A novel catalytic pathway for the synthesis of BMFM (C11 oxygenate) by the one-pot process was successfully developed over solid acidic nanocatalysts 3-ClPYPW. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Transforming waste to energy is essential in view of the need to search for greener and more sustainable energy sources. Such transformation of energy is also aligned with the aim of reducing excessive waste generation whilst creating potential biofuel pathways for power generation. In the present study, animal waste in the form of horse manure is being used as feedstock to undergo microwave-induced pyrolysis via a fixed-bed pyrolysis rig. The relationship of the pyrolysis parameters such as pyrolysis temperature of 350 and 550 °C, carrier gas flow rate of 0.5 and 1.5 L/min and ratio of horse manure to activated carbon blend of 1:2 and 1:1, with the yield of pyrolysed products is studied. The derived pyrolysis products in the form of solid, liquid and gaseous are characterised and quantified. Result shows that the highest yield of solid, liquid and gaseous products obtained are 78.8 wt%, 24.7 wt% and 34.2 wt%. Solid yield is observed to decrease with increasing pyrolysis temperature while gaseous yield shows a reverse trend. Higher carrier gas flow rate is observed to lower the generation of gaseous and liquid yield while increasing the solid yield. Higher amount of activated carbon within the feedstock is seen to lower the solid yield but increase the gaseous and liquid yields. The liquid yield is found to contain 55.78 wt% of phenolic compounds while gaseous product consists of up to 55 vol% of syngas. The control of the operating conditions in pyrolysis rig enables the production of pyrolysis end products in different phases, generating useful bioenergy and biofertilizer products in the context of circular economy.

AB  - The thermal and catalytic conversion processes of alternative feedstocks (e.g., waste and biomass) to different engine fuels can result in the formation of a significant amount of light hydrocarbons as by-products in the boiling range of gasoline. The properties of these C5/C6 hydrocarbons need to be improved due to many reasons, e.g., their benzene content, and/or poor oxidation stability (high olefin content) and low octane number (&lt;60). The aim of the research work was to increase the octane number of benzene containing C5/C6 bioparaffin fractions by catalytic isomerization. These by-products were obtained from special hydrocracking of waste cooking oil to hydrocarbons in the boiling range of aviation turbine fuels (JET fuels)/diesel fuels. Experiments were carried out in a reactor system containing down-flow tubular reactors over Pt/Al2O3/Cl and Pt/H-Mordenite/Al2O3 catalysts at 115-145 °C and 230-270 °C, respectively. Based on the results obtained at different process parameter combinations, it was concluded that the hydrogenation of benzene was complete over both catalysts, and the liquid yields were higher (ca. 98% &gt; ca. 93 %) in the case of Pt/Al2O3/Cl. In addition, the octane number was also enhanced (ca. 32 &gt; ca. 27 unit) in the products compared to the feedstock. This was because a higher isoparaffin content can be obtained at a lower operating temperature. Moreover, cracking side reactions take place to a lesser extent. The utilization of these isomerized bio-origin light fractions can contribute to the competitiveness of second-generation biofuels. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The research on ethyl levulinate synthesis is now increased due to its potential to be derived from biomass and for applications in biofuel. In the present work, model compound of biomass-derived intermediates, levulinic acid and furfural alcohol, were utilized for ethyl levulinate synthesis using modified carbon cryogel. Carbon cryogel produced from urea and furfural (UCC) mixtures was modified via sulfonation (UCC-S) and subsequently doped with Fe (UCC-S-Fe) to increase the surface chemistry of the reaction. In order to study the acidity and phase structure of the catalyst, the UCC-S and UCC-S-Fe were characterized by using NH3- TPD and XRD. The ethanolysis of levulinic acid and furfuryl alcohol were conducted in a batch reaction system for the catalytic testing experiment by study the effect of reaction time and catalyst loading. At the selected conditions, with UCC-S as the catalyst, a high ethyl levulinate yield of 99.5 mol% was obtained from ethanolysis of levulinic acid using 10 wt% of a catalyst loading for 4 h. Although UCC-S catalyst gives low ethyl levulinate yield from ethanolysis of furfuryl alcohol, a high yield ethyl levulinate of 97.8 mol% was observed within 5 h of reaction time by applying 20 wt% of UCC-S-Fe catalyst loading. Thus, the modification of urea-furfural carbon cryogel via sulfonation and Fe-doping have improved the properties of carbon cryogel and performed as a promising solid acid catalyst for ethyl levulinate production. However, different activity performances were demonstrated by the two catalysts in the ethanolysis reactions of levulinic acid and furfuryl alcohol. © 2020 AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - A greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction obligation system has been implemented in the Swedish road transport sector to promote the use of biofuels. For transportation fuel suppliers to fulfil this obligation, the volume of biofuel required decreases with decreasing life cycle GHG emission for the biofuel, linking lower GHG emission to higher economic value. The aim of this study was to investigate how the economic competitiveness of a Swedish emerging lignocellulosic-based ethanol production system would be influenced by the reduction obligation. The life cycle GHG emission for sawdust-based ethanol was calculated by applying the method advocated in the EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED II). The saving in GHG emissions, compared with fossil liquid transportation fuels, was 93% for a potential commercial production system in southern Sweden. This, in turn, will increase the competitiveness of sawdust-based ethanol compared to the mainly crop-based ethanol currently used in the Swedish biofuel system, which has an average GHG emission saving of 68%, and will allow for an almost 40% higher price of sawdust-based ethanol, compared to the current price of ethanol at point of import. In a future developed, large-scale market of advanced ethanol, today’s GHG emission reduction obligation system in Sweden seems to afford sufficient economic advantage to make lignocellulosic ethanol economically viable. However, in a short-term perspective, emerging lignocellulosic-based ethanol production systems are burdened with economic risks and therefore need additional economic incentives to make a market introduction possible. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Currently, the world is focusing on utilising biofuels as much as possible for internal combustion (IC) engine applications. Several strategies are being employed to improve fuel efficiency and decrease exhaust emissions of compression ignition (CI) engines which run on different biofuels. Fuel air mixture formation is one of the key aspects that influence engine behaviour in terms of combustion, emission, and performance of CI engines. In this research work, an attempt was made to induce air motion in a CI engine which was operated with an orange oil diesel (O-D) blend. For this purpose, a single cylinder, 4-stroke, air-cooled, direct injection (DI) diesel engine producing power of 4.4 kW at a constant speed of 1500 rpm was used. The piston of the engine was modified by two means to create turbulence; (i) piston with micro holes, and (ii) piston with micro holes and spiral grooves. The combustion characteristics of the test engine run on the O-D blend, without and with the change in piston geometries were evaluated, compared with the baseline diesel fuel operation, and presented in this paper. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Dependence on the exhaustible fossil fuels exhibited the urgent need for the development of alternative energy production based on green chemistry methods. Biodiesel production marks a green product produced from a variety of bio-entities. Current investigation is an account of the first time exploration of the biodiesel production from the seeds of sunflower (Helianthus annuus) previously garnered at a phytoremediation site. Sunflower crop has been grown for the accumulation of heavy metals at a contaminated site, later on such plants were utilised for biodiesel production via transesterification signifying a duality in achieving the purpose of environmental detoxification in addition to energy production. Biodiesel production based on the ethanolysis expressed an augmented transformation of up to 96% with simultaneously occurring inconsequential reactions. The prepared biodiesel was analysed for the presence of compounds and functional group through gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Furthermore, the derivation of other products, e.g. ethyl oleate can find a potential utilisation in the pharmaceutical industry associated with the making of drugs. Relevant and apropos upgradation of the sunflower seed oils can result in the favourable biofuels. Current research is the indicative of successful use of phytoremediated crops for gaining environmental integrity. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The biggest environmental challenge that we face today is the excessive emission of harmful gases from automobiles. As most of the automobiles use CI engines, new combustion concepts have been developed to reduce high emission. PCCI is one of the concepts in which fuel burns in premixed condition with better thermal efficiency and less smoke emission.Further to reduce the emission, biodiesel can be used which is the most evolving renewable energy source among biofuels. In this experiment, the biodiesel is produced by blending the Madhuca indica (mahua oil) and diesel. In our experiment, Mahua oil is blended with diesel in the ratio 1:2:3 (B10, B20, B30) using Sonicator. The three samples (B10, B20, B30) will be undergoing engine emission test and Performance test. The test reports will be studied and analyzed to select the suitable sample which provides less emission. © 2020 IJSTR.

AB  - One of the promising alternatives to fossil fuels, biodiesel, is a renewable fuel which can be defined as methyl or ethyl ester of fatty acid made prominently from vegetable oils or animal fat. The present study outlines the observations on the fatty acid alkyl ester generation by transesterification of cottonseed oil using Aspergillus species as whole-cell biocatalyst. Current work also represents the difference in ester yield on the addition of alcohol blends with two different molar ratios (1:4 or 1:6). Further, the fuel properties viz., density, viscosity, gross calorific value, flash point, cloud point and pour point of ethyl-butyl and ethyl-propyl ester were analyzed, as per ASTM 6751. No significant difference was observed in ester yield with both the molar ratio of alcohols. Ester yield up to 91% and 87% was obtained using 1:4 and 1:6 M ratio respectively. By the use of a lower molar ratio (1:4) and whole-cell catalyst, a significant reduction in the cost of production of biodiesel is as expected. Alcohol other than ethanol facilitated only a marginal increase in ester yield with no significant variation from propanol to octanol. The fuel properties showed significant improvement in comparison to standard biodiesel. The use of whole cell bio-catalysis, as demonstrated in present study can be considered as a promising alternative to a chemical catalyst for the generation of long-chain fatty acid esters. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biorefineries will play a critical role in sustainable bioeconomies, but projections of their environmental impacts vary widely. A core challenge with life cycle assessments (LCAs) of biorefineries is that they are often disconnected from biorefinery design, simulation, and techno-economic analysis (TEA). This lack of integration is a barrier to early stage technology and process evaluations, reducing consistency and transparency across sustainability indicators while limiting our understanding of the relative importance of individual factors (e.g., design decisions, greenhouse gas emission accounting procedures), how these factors interact, and trade-offs or synergies with process economics. In this study, we propose a new agile LCA framework, BioSTEAM-LCA, which layers onto BioSTEAM (Biorefinery Simulation and Techno-Economic Analysis Modules, which automates biorefinery design, simulation, and TEA) to characterize the environmental impacts of biorefineries across a landscape of designs, technology performance assumptions, and contexts. Inventory databases and impact assessment methods are integrated to enable flexible user defined LCA system models, and the implications of uncertainties throughout the production system are characterized via Monte Carlo simulation. To demonstrate the capabilities of BioSTEAM-LCA, we present a case study for sugarcane ethanol production. Overall, BioSTEAM-LCA enables computationally efficient, agile gate-to-gate LCA to evaluate biorefinery processes, the production of candidate biofuels and bioproducts, and trade-offs among productivity, economics, and environmental impacts under uncertainty. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this research work, the effect of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) as additive with waste fishing net oil on performance, emission and combustion characteristics of a diesel engine were examined. Waste fishing net oil (WFNO) was obtained by pyrolysis process. The properties of WFNO revealed that oil produced from the waste fishing net can be used in a diesel engine without any engine modifications. The nano additive was characterized by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) and also by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). At a constant speed of 1500 rpm, engine performance, emission and combustion characteristics were analysed and compared with conventional diesel fuel. Engine test showed that fuel produced from the waste fishing net was able to work efficiently in a diesel engine without any engine alterations. Experimental results revealed that there was a significant improvement in combustion characteristic with the incorporation of MWCNT with WFNO. At 100% load, brake thermal efficiency was increased by 3.83% and brake specific fuel consumption was decreased by 3.87% with the addition of MWCNT to WFNO. Further, the results showed a significant reduction in engine exhaust emissions like CO, UHC, NO and smoke by 25%, 9.09% 5.25% and 14.81% respectively and a slight increase in CO2 emission by 17.39%. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The microbial pathway of butanol biosynthesis is a unique route for the production of a biomass-derived advanced biofuel with high potential to be utilized in place of the fossil fuels. In the present study, Nesterenkonia sp. strain F was applied as a beneficial partner for Clostridium acetobutylicum in “starch-to-butanol process”. The capability of Nesterenkonia sp. strain F in secreting organic solvent-tolerant amylase was utilized for upgrading the yield of solvent, i.e., acetone, butanol, and ethanol (ABE), production under aerobic conditions. Monitoring the amylolytic activity and glucose concentration throughout the micro-aerobic co-culture revealed higher amylase activity and glucose concentration in comparison with the monoculture. The co-culture led to 63% higher amylase activity through the microaerobic cultivation on starch. After optimizing the conditions with response surface methodology (RSM), 10.6 g/L butanol was produced from untreated potato starch (UPS) with a high yield of 0.23 g ABE/g starch, leading to 30% improvement in ABE production. To assess its performance at larger scale, the fermentation was conducted in a 5 L fermenter continually aerated with a rate of 0.05 vvm and 150 rpm. This led to production of 9.7 g/L butanol, 5.0 g/L acetone, and 0.3 g/L ethanol with a yield and productivity of 0.20 g/g and 0.21 g/L.h, respectively. Furthermore, ABE production from tannin-containing sorghum grain was improved by about 3-fold. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Availability of sustainable transportation fuels in future hinges on the use of lignocellulosic resources for production of biofuels. The process of biomass pyrolysis can be used to convert solid biomass resources into liquid fuels. In this study, laboratory experiments and process simulations were combined to gain insight into the technical performance of catalytic and thermal pyrolysis processes. Waste pinewood was used as a feedstock for the processes. The pyrolysis took place at 500◦C and employs three different catalysts, in the case of the catalytic processes. A process model was developed with Aspen Plus and a wide range of representative components of bio-oil were used to model the properties of the bio-oil blend. The results of the process model calculations show that catalytic pyrolysis process produces bio-oil of superior quality. Different technical process scenarios were explored based on the properties of the bio-oil after separation of water-soluble components, with the intention of producing a blendable or stand-alone product. It was found that—depending on the bio-oil requirements—sufficient hydrogen can be made available from the aqueous fraction to further treat the organic fraction to the desired extent. The resulting organic fractions are suitable candidates for blending with conventional fuels. The analysis results are used to provide guidance for catalyst development. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Life cycle assessment (LCA) entails the analysis of potential environmental loads and natural resources utilised while manufacturing a product, which helps in sustainable production of biofuel and prudent management of natural resources. A variety of bio resources including microalgae are being explored for its potential as viable alternatives to conventional fossil fuels. This communication presents the lifecycle assessment of biodiesel production from microalgae and valorisation of other value-added products. Comparative assessment of feedstock cultivation was done by considering varied nutrient inputs – (i) no nutrient input (scenario 1), (ii) wastewater as nutrient input (scenario 2) and (iii) fertiliser input (scenario 3). Two different transesterification techniques followed for converting microalgal oil into biodiesel were i) acid catalyst and ii) biocatalyst. Environmental impacts of different scenarios considered were assessed using OpenLCA v1.10.3, which highlights higher eutrophication and photochemical oxidation related emissions for fertiliser input scenario with acid catalyst based transesterification. However, significant reductions in environmental impacts with minimal GHG footprint was observed with wastewater use for cultivating algae and transesterification through biocatalyst. Life cycle assessment of three different scenarios revealed a fossil energy requirement variation between 3.6 and 5.7 MJ/kg and the greenhouse gas emission (as kg equivalent CO2 emissions) of 0.85–1.46 kg CO2eq.kg−1 of biodiesel. This highlights a reduction in fossil energy requirement of about 87.3% in the pilot substrate-based microalgal bioreactor. Wastewater – biocatalyst scenario exhibited a highest net energy ratio (NER) of 18.8 with an additional benefit of low cost remediation of wastewater. © 2020

AB  - Background: In an effort to ensure future energy security, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create domestic jobs, the US has invested in technologies to develop sustainable biofuels and bioproducts from renewable carbon sources such as lignocellulosic biomass. Bio-derived jet fuel is of particular interest as aviation is less amenable to electrification compared to other modes of transportation and synthetic biology provides the ability to tailor fuel properties to enhance performance. Specific energy and energy density are important properties in determining the attractiveness of potential bio-derived jet fuels. For example, increased energy content can give the industry options such as longer range, higher load or reduced takeoff weight. Energy-dense sesquiterpenes have been identified as potential next-generation jet fuels that can be renewably produced from lignocellulosic biomass. Results: We developed a biomass deconstruction and conversion process that enabled the production of two tricyclic sesquiterpenes, epi-isozizaene and prespatane, from the woody biomass poplar using the versatile basidiomycete Rhodosporidium toruloides. We demonstrated terpene production at both bench and bioreactor scales, with prespatane titers reaching 1173.6 mg/L when grown in poplar hydrolysate in a 2 L bioreactor. Additionally, we examined the theoretical fuel properties of prespatane and epi-isozizaene in their hydrogenated states as blending options for jet fuel, and compared them to aviation fuel, Jet A. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that prespatane and epi-isozizaene in their hydrogenated states would be attractive blending options in Jet A or other lower density renewable jet fuels as they would improve viscosity and increase their energy density. Saturated epi-isozizaene and saturated prespatane have energy densities that are 16.6 and 18.8% higher than Jet A, respectively. These results highlight the potential of R. toruloides as a production host for the sustainable and scalable production of bio-derived jet fuel blends, and this is the first report of prespatane as an alternative jet fuel. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Waste cooking oil (WCO) as feedstocks for biodiesel production contains high free fatty acid and water, causing negative impacts on the biodiesel yield and its purity. In this work, three alternative methods for handling water content in WCO feedstocks using the earlier hybridization of esterification and transesterification in a single reactive distillation column (hybridized RD) were investigated. Our simulation results revealed that using two heat exchangers combined with the hybridized RD is a simple method to remove water from WCO. However, it requires the highest energy as well as biodiesel production cost (1.63 USD/kg biodiesel). The extended spacing stage modification of the hybridized RD was proposed to remove water content. It requires a new hybridized RD construction by spacing stages addition which can handle WCO with 10 wt% of water content and require less energy, resulting in lower biodiesel production cost (1.07 USD/kg biodiesel). The integration of pervaporation unit was found to be the best option. It offers the highest performance in terms of water removal and methanol recovery, resulting in the lowest biodiesel production cost (1.04 USD/kg biodiesel). This study shows that using pervaporation or extended spacing stages with hybridized RD are promising methods for biodiesel production from WCO. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present research, the efforts have been lodged to improve the combustion and performance characteristics along with exhaust emissions of diesel-schleichera oleosa biodiesel blends by adding nanoparticles of alumina and multi-walled carbon nanotubes. The nanoparticles (np's) were synthesized and their morphologies were characterized by using Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) and X-ray Diffraction spectroscopy (XRD) techniques. Test fuels containing 50 ppm and 100 ppm dosage of nanoparticles were dispersed with diesel–biodiesel blends and were labelled as D80B20A50, D80B20A100 (alumina (Al2O3) nanoparticles) and D80B20C50, D80B20C100 (multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT)). The droplet size of test fuels was analysed by using a laser-diffraction based Malvern Spraytec set-up. Interestingly, nano-additive dispersed test fuels showed smaller droplet size due to the higher force of collision between the nanoparticles. Moreover, the engine trial showed up to a 2–13% increase in brake thermal efficiency and upto 5–60% drop in exhaust emissions for nanoparticles dispersed test fuels. Also, alumina showed better results than MWCNT in terms of higher thermal efficiency, lower specific energy consumption and lower exhaust emissions as compared to diesel. However, due to the superior sorbent of nitrogen oxides, the (100 ppm) MWCNT has resulted in a maximum reduction of NO emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - 1-butene is an important intermediate in combustion of various hydrocarbon fuels and oxygenated biofuels (e.g., butanol). Understanding its oxidation chemistry can help improve ignition and combustion process in advanced engines and provide better emission control. This work addresses a discrepancy between experiments and simulations in 1-butene oxidation at low temperatures, wherein simulations with AramcoMech 3.0 model show greater fuel reactivity than experiments. To further explore 1-butene low temperature reaction pathways from 550 to 910 K, experiments were conducted in three jet-stirred reactors: two coupled to time-of-flight molecular beam mass spectrometers with synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet radiation as the photoionization source, and one coupled to gas chromatography mass spectrometer. Isomeric structure identification, comprehensive species datasets, and reactor cross examinations are provided by the combination of three experiments. The identified isomer-resolved species provide evidence of various 1-butene low temperature reaction pathways. For example, the identification of propanal confirms the Waddington reaction pathway. The kinetic model over-predicts fuel reactivity in the low temperature regime (550–700 K). Updating the rate coefficients of key reactions in the Waddington pathways, e.g., forward and reverse isomerization of hydroxyl-butyl-peroxide to butoxyl-peroxide and Waddington decomposition of butoxyl-peroxide reduces the discrepancies. The role of rate constant updates in each step of the Waddington pathway is evaluated and discussed to provide directions for future model development. © 2020

AB  - In this study, a novel renewable hybrid system was designed and constructed to efficiently produce biodiesel through various methods. First, a parabolic trough solar collector (PTC) was used as a renewable source for producing desalinated water in a solar still. Then, the heat dissipated by PTC and water produced by the solar still were used to generate biodiesel. Finally, the combined cycle of PTC/desalination/biodiesel generator was applied to produce heat and steady power. Necessary electricity in the hybrid system containing pumps, mixing tools, etc. was provided by photovoltaic panels. After launching the hybrid system and performing experiments to produce biodiesel on Palm and Chlorella bioenergy carriers, the percentage of the biodiesel production for these two species in different ways were as follows: alkaline catalyzed transesterification (79.17,81.46), acid-catalyzed transesterification (79.1,81.43), two-step transesterification (78.07,81.42), supercritical transesterification (75.16,80.68), microemulsion (76.3,81.4), electrolysis (50.25, 58.87), and pyrolysis (13.677,14.833). Moreover, the lowest price belonged to the alkaline catalyzed transesterification which for palm/chlorella was 0.65/0.972. In most methods, the cetane number of palm-based biodiesel was higher (∼58). Consequently, it had a better combustion quality compared to chlorella-based biodiesel (∼44). This study also modeled various processes for the bioenergy carrier conversion. The results were consistent with experimental data. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lipase from Candida rugosa was physically attached to Mg modified Fe2O4 nanoparticles (NPs) and employed for the conversion of brewers’ spent grains (BSGs) into biodiesel, in the presence of methanol. The proposed strategy explored the direct immobilization of the enzyme on the as-prepared oleic acid modified inexpensive NPs. In addition, a large amount of enzyme was bound on the NPs, allowing their efficient recycling by using an external magnet. A very remarkable better yield of 98% was achieved at 1:4 oil/methanol molar ratio after 48 h at 45 °C reaction temperature. The nanocatalyst also exhibits good recyclability. The biodiesel produced was analyzed according to EN 14214. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study demonstrates that the biodiesel (BD) from swine manure (SM) could be a promising way for large scale generation of biofuel. Also, the economic and environmental benefits of SM derived BD were evaluated. Transesterification of lipid contents extracted from the collected SM had low BD yield (14.2 wt%) using H2SO4 catalyst due to high acid value and impurities. However, thermo-chemical non-catalytic transesterification with a porous material showed 94.7 wt% yield of BD from the lipid in SM. Considering the current population of swine, the annual production of BD from SM was estimated. The SM derived BD could cover 19.7 and 46.8 wt% of BD currently produced in both Korea and the USA with the economic benefits of up to $96 million and $2.1 billion, respectively. The proposed approach also can save vast arable lands needed to cultivate oil-bearing feedstocks for BD production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This article analyzes the transition towards second-generation (2G) biofuels during the 2005–2018 period in Brazil, which is a world leader of first-generation (1G) biofuels. In the case of Brazil 2G technologies are associated with sugarcane and the technologies of this transition considered in this article are enzymatic hydrolysis and energy cane. The analytical background used is the technological innovation systems (TIS) framework. The functioning of the innovation system is studied using scientific papers, patents, reports, newspaper information, and other data from Brazilian funding agencies. The paper examines how the functions of the Brazilian bioethanol TIS related to 2G biofuels operated and were interconnected in this period. We found that the knowledge development and resource mobilization functions operated positively but others did not, especially guidance of the search, market formation and creation of legitimacy, revealing an unbalanced system transformation. During this period there were two important phases, one dominated by academic actors and the other by the federal development bank. However, we found that the functions were not enough to explain the TIS evolution, and that the external context of the global TIS and the Brazilian macroeconomic dynamic were also very important to explain this evolution. We conclude that the transition was not completed and that in the future policies should consider system dynamics and context evolution. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To date, apart from alcohol, few alternative fuels have been investigated for the operation of port fuel injection (PFI) engines. The current study is examining the suitability of a ternary blend of lemon peel oil (LPO), ethanol, and gasoline as a drop in fuel for traditional gasoline engines. Unique combinations of LPO blends with a calorific value exceeding 40 MJ/kg and stoichiometric air to fuel ratio exceeding 14 are tested on a PFI equipped single-cylinder Kirloskar engine. In this study, two binary blends (G60L40, G80E20) and two ternary blends (G60E20L20, G40E20L40) are prepared on a volume basis and investigated for combustion, performance, and emission characteristics. Combustion stability based exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rate of 10% is proposed for the ternary blend (G40E20L40). The experimental results showed that the thermodynamic performance of ternary blends is similar to baseline gasoline with a 60% reduction in CO and a 15% reduction in NOx with 10% EGR. Biofuel blends exhibit higher in-cylinder pressure than gasoline due to the higher laminar flame velocities of LPO and ethanol. The ternary G40E20L40 blend with 10% EGR at 3.91 bar BMEP produces higher brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and marginally higher brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) indicating an insignificant effect on vehicle range on a full tank and good alternative that utilizes 60% renewable fuel with gasoline without any changes to the PFI engine and simultaneously reaping the benefits of significantly improved emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae are seen as potential biomass to be used in a biorefinery concept. Several technologies can be used to convert microalgal biomass, but pyrolysis is viewed as a unique pathway to obtain valuable chemicals distributed in three phases: liquid (bio-oil), gas (bio-gas) and solid (bio-char). The liquid phase, bio-oil, usually presents higher heating value than raw biomass, but acidity and oxygen content are major drawbacks. In situ catalyzed pyrolysis can help to decrease the oxygen content and acidity of pyrolytic bio-oils. Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus obliquus were pyrolyzed in a fixed-bed reactor using commercial carbonate catalysts (Li2CO3, Na2CO3, K2CO3, MgCO3, SrCO3 and MnCO3). The catalysis pyrolysis temperature (375 °C) was selected from thermal degradation profiles obtained using thermogravimetry under nitrogen flow and corresponds to the maximum degradation rate for both microalgae. In spite of similar volatile and fixed carbon contents, microalgae performed differentially during pyrolysis mainly due to the different contents of carbohydrates, oils and proteins. Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus obliquus showed bio-oil yield in the range 26–38 and 28–50 wt%, respectively. Only sodium carbonate was able to decrease the bio-char yield, confirming that carbonate catalysts prompt simultaneously gasification and carbonization reactions. Fourier transform infrared spectra of produced bio-oils showed a net decrease of acidity, associated with carbonyl species when carbonate catalysts were used. Bio-char morphology, for both microalgae, showed evidence of melting and resolidification of cell structures, which might be due to the lower melting points of the pyrolysis products obtained from proteins and lipids. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - The study explores the potential of ethanol as an additive on the performance, combustion and exhaust emission characteristics of a compression ignition engine fueled with adulterated diesel considering the environmental protection agency tier 4 emission mandates. Results showed that the inclusion of ethanol in the adulterated diesel notably reduced engine exhaust emissions along with improvement in the performance and combustion parameters. The experiential study was followed by a Pareto-based multi-objective optimization study to achieve non-dominated solutions for the performance-emission paradigms under diesel-kerosene-ethanol blends. The functional relationships for the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II were acquired with the assistance of response surface methodology technique. The optimal values of the output parameters of the engine, such as brake thermal efficiency, cumulated oxide of nitrogen & unburned hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions were evaluated by utilizing a multi-attribute decision making technique using input parameters, such as brake mean effective pressure, kerosene share and ethanol share. The optimization result reveals that among the different running conditions used in this study, the engine can be operated in the most optimal manner at 2.2 bar brake mean effective pressure, 2.4% kerosene share (by volume) and 10% ethanol share (by volume). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The formation, growth and transformation of the carbon residue (coke) deposited on the catalyst during the raw bio-oil hydrodeoxygenation have been studied. These deposits have a great impact on the overall process performance, and they have been formed in accelerated deactivation conditions (450 °C, 65 bar, space time of 0.09 gcat h gbio-oil-1) using a continuous fixed bed reactor and a FeMoP/HZSM-5 catalyst. Coke deposition causes partial deactivation of the catalyst, which reaches a pseudosteady state of constant activity and also contant yields of interesting chemicals. The evolution of the coke in the transient state has been studied through temperature-programmed oxidation, Raman spectroscopy and elemental analysis. We have identified three different types of coke, whose composition evolves with time on stream towards condensed and stable structures. The assessment of the evolution of the reaction medium composition and the application of the principal component analysis (PCA) methodology have evidenced that the dynamics of coke have three stages: (1) it is controlled by the thermally-induced deposition of thermal lignin; (2) followed by the interconversion into intermediate coke through aging reactions; and (3) it ends up in a pseudosteady state dominated by the formation of catalytic coke species originating from both deoxygenated and carbonized intermediate coke as well as the condensation of aromatics in the reaction medium.

AB  - We analyze water-energy tradeoffs for hypothetical algae production for biofuel feedstock in the US-Mexico middle Rio Grande watershed with a coupled water, salinity, and algae biomass balance model. Suitable areas for algae cultivation in the region are selected and associated with fresh or brackish groundwater sources. We examine the potential of using two algae species with markedly different energy content and tolerance to salinities. Location-specific water quality and time-varying climate variables were important when analyzing water-energy tradeoffs for each species. In this regional study, water demand rates for the salinity-tolerant species were similar to rates for conventional local crops, whereas the salinity-sensitive species’ values exceeded local demand rates. Optimizing the spatial selection of species resulted in water footprint reductions of as much as 18%. Water demand rates and footprints are highly sensitive to salinity and temperature tolerance and thus local variations in water quality and seasonal variations in climate. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - This research evaluated the dual production of bioenergy in heterotrophic cultures of cyanobacteria. Process performance parameters, carbon balance, single-cell oil production, biofuel quality, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) generation, and sustainability metrics and impact indicators were assessed. The results showed biomass productivity of 1.03 kg/m³/d. Biomass (63.9%) and VOCs (8.56%) were the main products formed from the conversion of the substrate in the bioreactor. For single-cell-oil production, it is possible to obtain 0.18 kg/m³/d of lipid with this bioprocess. It was determined the fatty acid profile and the quality of biodiesel properties, meeting the requirements established by national and international standards. Besides, the 22 volatile compounds identified presented the energy potential of 122,205.00 kJ/kg and a power generation rate of 10,580.5 kg/m3/d. From an environmental point of view, the net energy ratio was 0.13, while the eight mid-points impact categories resulted in an ecotoxicity potential of 430.86 CTUe, energy resources of 230.04 MJ, global warming of 171.05 kg CO2 eq, photochemical oxidation of 1.33 kg O3 eq, water footprint of 1.08 m³, acidification of 0.44 kg SO2 eq, eutrophication of 0.13 kg N eq, and ozone depletion of kg 1.83 × 10−5 CFC-11 eq, per functional unit of 1 m³ of the bioreactor, operating for 5 days. Finally, the proposed process can be considered as a promising strategy for renewable energy production from microalgae. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present work investigated the synthesis of carbon nanotubes from engine soot particles by laser ablation vaporization method. The synthesized carbon nanotubes were characterized structurally by X-ray Diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Raman Spectroscopy and Thermogravimetry Analysis. Further, the effects of adding carbon nanotubes in to Schizochytrium methyl ester-diesel blended fuel (20% by volume Schizochytrium methyl ester + 80% diesel and 40% by volume Schizochytrium methyl ester + 60% diesel; symbolized by SCME 20 and SCME 40 respectively) were investigated on the performance, combustion and emission characteristics of direct injection diesel engine. The carbon nanotubes were mixed ultrasonically at two concentrations of 25 and 50 ppm in SCME 20 and SCME 40 individually. All blends were investigated under different engine loading conditions and their results reported that by adding carbon nanotubes at 25–50 ppm of SCME 20 increased the brake thermal efficiency by 2.5% and decreased the brake specific fuel consumption by 3.2% when compared to the neat SCME 20 blend. The maximum heat release rate and peak in-cylinder pressure were found increased by 5% and 4%, respectively. More specifically, the engine exhaust emissions such as UHC, CO, NOx and smoke found reduced by 14.28%, 23.07%, 5% and 21.52% respectively, at a concentrations of 50 ppm in SCME20 blends. The result showed that the concentrations of 50 ppm in SCME20 possess the optimum enhancement in the performance and emissions of the DICI engine. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Biodiesel obtained from yeast derived single cell oil (SCO) is considered as an alternative to conventional biodiesel derived from plant oils, having the potential to substitute petroleum-derived transport fuels. In this work, we have developed a heterogeneous potassium hydroxide catalyst (K-RAC) supported on Rhodotorula mucilaginosa deoiled cake activated carbon (RAC) to enhance the conversion of R. mucilaginosa isolate R2 derived SCO as well as waste cooking oil (WCO) to biodiesel. The prepared catalyst was characterized by XRD, FTIR, EDX, SEM, BET and TGA. Basicity of the catalyst was determined by CO2-TPD and the hammet indicator test. The maximum fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) conversion of 96.6% and 98.66% for SCO and WCO respectively were obtained at optimized parameters i.e. 9:1 molar ratio (methanol/oil), 3 wt % of K-RAC loading at 60 °C and reaction time of 3 h. 1H NMR and GCMS was used to confirm the formation of biodiesel. The K-RAC was recycled effectively for five consecutive cycles. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The efficiency of extracts with antioxidant properties of plum pulp, black tea and green tea leaves was evaluated, analyzing the induction periods (IP) and rate constants (k) at 110 °C, in the 1st, 30th, 57th an 91st day of storage. Antioxidant activity was observed in all extracts, either by the rat constant decreased or by the induction period increase. The higher induction period obtained was 9.15 h for the black tea leaves extract while the lower was 6.97 h for the green tea leaves extract. The control had an average induction period of 6.95 h for the first day. The models obtained are significant and showed determination coefficients greater than 0.90 with no significance lack of fit at the level of 5%. The optimization with maximization of the induction period and minimization of the rate constant showed that the black tea extract was the most suitable to avoid oxidation. On the first day of test, the optimization indicates the mixture containing 50% of black tea and 50% of plum pulp extract as the best mixture. The optimizations provided a variation of 8.92 &lt; IP (h) &lt; 9.69 and 0.25 &lt; k (h−1) &lt; 0.38. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Binary blends of fast-reacting diethyl ether (DEE) and slow-reacting ethanol (EtOH) are quite promising as renewable replacements for conventional fuels in modern compression ignition engines. In this work, pure diethyl ether and a 50/50 M binary blend of diethyl ether and ethanol (DEE/EtOH) were investigated in a shock tube and a rapid compression machine. Ignition delay times were measured over the temperature range of 550–1000 K, pressures of 20–40 bar, and equivalence ratios of 0.5–1. Literature reaction mechanisms of diethyl ether and ethanol were combined to simulate the reactivity trends of the blends. Species rate-of-production and sensitivity analyses were performed to analyze the interplay between radicals originating from the two fuels. Multistage ignition behavior was observed in both experiments and simulations, with peculiar 3-stage ignition visible at fuel-lean conditions. Kinetic analyses were used to identify the reactions controlling various stages of ignition. Reactivity comparison of DEE/EtOH and dimethyl ether/ethanol (DME/EtOH) blends showed that the oxidation of DEE blends is controlled by acetaldehyde whereas formaldehyde controls the oxidation of DME blends. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Diesel/biodiesel blends (BX) have great relevance in the market since they cover very important needs of both the economic and environmental sectors in Brazil. However, the increasingly biodiesel introduction in the blend composition can lead to instability problems. Such issues depend on biodiesel quality and type, blends composition, storage material, time and microclimate conditions. The objective of this work is to evaluate the quality performance of diesel/biodiesel blends containing biodiesels produced from pure soybean oil and a mixture of soybean oil/animal fat raw materials, under different storage conditions, at the levels B5, B10, B15, and B20, for six months. The samples were kept stored in two groups of amber polyethylene 1L bottles, under natural aging atmospheric conditions. One group was kept in normal climatic conditions of Belo Horizonte – Brazil (Tropical Wet-Dry Climate). The other under high humidity, in an attempt to simulate fuel storage conditions in the Amazon region (Tropical Moist Climate). Stability parameters monitoring was performed monthly, through analysis of selected physical-chemical properties, such as aspect, water content, acidity index, oxidation stability and total contamination. The results showed that blends with higher biodiesel content (B15 and B20) presented more nonconformities. A reduction in fuel quality was found to occur in the short-term, even for those with antioxidant additives, especially when the biodiesel content, storage temperature, and humidity were high. In general, the study demonstrated that the biofuel should be used judiciously particularly in high humidity storage conditions and alternative viable solutions should be envisage for such regions. © 2020

AB  - Deoxygenation (DX) is a key enhancement process for biomass-derived biofuel production. To understand the DX mechanism of palm oils, we performed experimental and computational studies to investigate the DX reaction of palmitic acid on Ni2P catalyst. Experimental characterization and catalytic testing demonstrated that the DX on unsupported (0 0 1)-Ni2P catalyst prefers the decarbonylation (DCO) pathway over the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) pathway with the ratios between 2.17 and 4.13 to 1. Mechanistic study using density functional theory calculation revealed that the DX of butyric acid also prefers DCO over HDO pathway. Both experimental and computational results suggested that the decarboxylation (DCO2) pathway is unlikely. The computation results indicated that the rate-limiting step of HDO pathway is in the butanol to butane conversion (activation energy Ea = 1.99 eV), whereas that of the DCO pathway is found during the butanal to propane conversion (Ea = 1.52 eV). However, additional thermodynamic analysis accounting for hydrotreating reaction condition (H2 = 50 bars at 653 K) suggested that the rate-determining step for the DCO pathway is actually the hydrogenation of butyric acid. In addition, the thermodynamics analysis also suggests that increasing reaction temperature may increase selectivity of HDO pathway. The mechanistic insights gained from this study will be beneficial for the enhancement of DX process for biofuel production. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Currently, the major obstacle in the utilization of biofuels produced from the thermochemical processes for the co-refining approach is miscibility with conventional crude oil followed by co-processing to reduce the high oxygen content. The present study attempted to find the appropriate refinery distillate to blend with bio-crude produced via hydrothermal liquefaction to determine the desired process conditions for miscible blend formulation. Boiling point distribution curves revealed that hydrotreated heavy gas oil was found to be the suitable refinery distillate and the desired process conditions were established for 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20 wt% blends formulation. Further, 10 wt% blend was hydrotreated to evaluate the hydrodeoxygenation ability of the commercial catalysts such as CoMo/γ-Al2O3 and NiMo/γ-Al2O3 to reduce the oxygen content. The physicochemical properties of the formulated blends showed that proper mixing took place between bio-crude and hydrotreated heavy gas oil. Hydrotreatment (via co-processing) of the 10 wt% blend revealed that the commercial catalysts can reduce the oxygen content in the range of 21–28%. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, ethyl and methyl esters of black mustard (Brassica nigra L.) seed oil using NaOH and KOH were produced. To attain the optimum condition for biodiesel production from black mustard oil, varied catalyst quantity, alcohol amount, reaction temperature, and reaction time were explored and applying polynomial regression method (PRM) adopted. The minimum biodiesel yield was obtained as 96.229% using 45.12 wt% ethanol and 0.838 wt% KOH by weight of oil at 56 min reaction time, and 35.4 °C reaction temperature. On the other hand, the maximum biodiesel yield was achieved to be 97.335% utilizing KOH of 0.4 wt% and methanol of 20.39 wt%, at the reaction temperature of 57.1 °C, and reaction time of 54.1 min. The increase in biodiesel yield was determined to be on the order of 1.4380, 0.0814, 0.0548 and 0.4352% for NaOHMB, KOHMB, NaOHEB, and KOHEB, respectively, with PRM. Consequently, it can be stated that in comparison with the classical method, PRM is a more promising optimization technique in order to get a higher biodiesel yield. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present study, the marine microalga Tisochrysis lutea was cultivated mixotrophically in F2 growth medium with sodium acetate as exogenous carbon source. The medium was composed of different concentrations of nitrogen to determine the impact of nitrogen depletion on cellular growth and chemical composition. Nitrogen depletion led to severely decreased growth and protein content. However, mild nitrogen depletion (0.22 mM NaNO3) led to maximum lipid yield. The fatty acid methyl ester profile also showed increased unsaturation as the nitrogen content decreased. Growth in nitrogen-free medium increased the proportions of mono- and poly-unsaturated fatty acids, while the proportion of saturated fatty acids decreased. Growth under all tested nitrogen levels showed undetectable fatty acids with ≥4 double bonds, indicating these fatty acids had oxidative stability. In addition, all tested nitrogen concentrations led to specific gravity, kinematic viscosity, iodine value, and cetane number that meet the standards for Europe and the U.S.A. However, growth in the presence of nitrogen deficiency enhanced the higher heating value of the resulting biodiesel, a clear advantage from the perspective of energy efficiency. Thus, mixotrophic cultivation of T. lutea with nitrogen limitation provides a promising approach to achieve high lipid productivity and production of high-quality biodiesel. © 2020 by the author.

AB  - The development of sustainable biofuel production has been promoted in many countries to reduce the use of fossil fuel. This work analyses the life cycle global warming impact, net energy and fossil energy ratios for two alternatives diesohol (diesel/bioethanol) fuels and a new modified diesohol using distilled cashew nut shell liquid/biodiesel. Owing to the molecular structure, biodiesel and distilled cashew nut shell liquid can be used as emulsifier to stabilise the diesohol as well as to slightly reduce the portion of diesel in the blend. The uncertainty analysis, land use change impact, and cost performance comparison in the life cycle assessment were also considered. The well-to-wheel analysis of the biofuel life cycle was used as a system boundary. The results indicated that the global warming impact and the energy performance were not significantly different among the three diesohol alternatives. The global warming impact of all studied alternative fuels was estimated as 68.22–75.69 kg CO2 equivalent/1000 MJ, which was 18–26% lower than that of conventional diesel. This was due to the environmental benefits obtained from biodiesel, bioethanol, and distilled cashew nut shell liquid, avoiding CO2 emissions from combustion in fuel blends because they are of biogenic origin. The substitution of diesel by fuel blends resulted in the net energy ratios (1.01–1.08) and fossil energy ratios (0.96–1.04) of the three alternatives diesohol fuels that were 14–19% and 9–16% higher than that of the conventional diesel. The fossil energy ratios of fuel blends were slightly lower than the net energy ratios by 3.70–4.95%. The LCIA result showed that, according to the uncertainty analysis, the global warming impact from well-to-wheel analysis of the modified diesohol fuel with 85 vol.% diesel, 15 vol.% bioethanol and 20 vol.% (based on the combined volume of diesel and bioethanol) biodiesel was, with 100% probability, less than that of other disohol alternatives studied. The results indicated that alternative diesohol fuel in the case of 15% bioethanol was an environmental and economic superior choice of all studied alternatives fuels because of its lowest global warming impact (with and without LUC), while providing the highest energy efficiency with the net energy ratio and fossil energy ratio of 1.08 and 1.04, respectively. To improve the performance in terms of environmental and eonomic perspectives, the integration of fossil fuels and biofuels would improve the sustainable choices and promote the value-added domestic materials from renewable resources for transportation fuels in Thailand. © 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - For the fulfillment of the Directive EU/2001/2018 targets for 2030, one of the main restrictions in the development of biodiesel fuels from sustainable feedstocks are currently the filterability problems. Contaminants such as saturated monoglycerides, sodium soaps and free steryl glucosides in biodiesel fuels have been found to clog fuel filters in vehicles, fuel dispensers and other industrial equipment which reduces the lifetime of the filters, and may result in fuel starvation, with engine operating difficulties and possible fuel-injection equipment damage. From a distilled biodiesel fuel spiked with these contaminants and subsequently blended with diesel fuel, samples fulfilling quality standards were prepared. filter blocking tendency, cold soak filtration test and total contamination tests were measured. It was found that filterability properties were affected always by the highest contaminant contents, both individually and synergistically. Total contamination test presented inconclusive results. The following conclusions were achieved: i) improvements in the precision of filterability and total contamination methods should be searched; ii) future regulations of biodiesel fuels should limit the free steryl-glucoside, saturated monoglyceride and sodium soap contents; iii) the current biodiesel fuel standards around the world do not secure the filterability properties, which could cause premature fuel filter clogging. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Levulinic acid (LA), a lignocellulosic biomass-derived compound has been recognized as one of the versatile building blocks for the synthesis of commodity chemicals having biofuel properties together with potential as precursor for the synthesis of several value-added pharmaceuticals and polymers. Herein, we report the synthesis of catalytically active functionalized porous organic polymer and its utilization as heterogeneous organocatalyst for the synthesis of EL from LA in very high yield. Here, sulfonic acid functionalized porous organic polymer SBZ@POP have been prepared via simple Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene with dimethoxymethane followed by sulfonation of the aromatic rings. The structure and properties of the material was examined through PXRD, N2 sorption, HR TEM, 13C CP-MAS NMR, NH3-TPD, TG-DTA and FTIR analysis. Our characterization data suggested nanoscale porosity with high surface acidity in SBZ@POP. The effects of reaction time, catalyst loading, molar ratio of levulinic acid to ethanol and reaction temperature were studied thoroughly to optimize the catalytic activity of SBZ@POP. Under optimized reaction conditions EL yield of 88 % has been achieved with 1:15 molar ratio of LA to ethanol under refluxing conditions in 10 h. This porous organic polymer based organocatalyst displayed good recyclability for consecutive five reaction cycles suggesting the sustainable application potential of this acidic organocatalyst. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present investigation aims to develop simultaneous extraction and conversion of inedible Madhuca longifolia seed oil into biodiesel by one-step acid-catalyzed in situ transesterification/reactive extraction process. Six different types of pretreatment were used to assess maximum yield of biodiesel. The maximum yield of 96% biodiesel was acquired with ultrasonic pretreatment at 1% moisture content, 0.61 mm seed grain size, 55 °C temperature, 400 rpm stirring speed, 15 wt% catalyst (H2SO4) concentration, and with 1:35 seed oil to methanol ratio in a time period of 180 min. This reaction kinetics precedes first order also the finest value of rate constant and activation energy were calculated as 0.003 min−1 and 14.840 kJ mol−1. The thermodynamic energy properties ΔG, ΔH, and ΔS are computed as 96457.172 J/mol, 12121.812 J/mol K, and − 257.12 J/mol K correspondingly. The enumerated outcome illustrates a heat absorb non-spontaneous/endergonic and endothermal reaction. The result of proposed work unveils ultrasonic pretreatment escalates the biodiesel efficiency and reactive extraction exemplifies the clean, cost-effective single-step approach for production of biodiesel from non-edible sources. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study focuses on the synthesis of a novel heterogeneous CoO–NiO promoted sulfated ZrO2 (CN/SZ) catalyst and investigating its catalytic efficiency as a transesterification reagent. Catalytic performance has also been compared with two reference catalysts viz., sulfated ZrO2 (SZ) and pure ZrO2 (Z). Prepared materials were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique, N2- adsorption/desorption study, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX), Raman, Fourier Transformed Infrared (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron (XP) spectroscopy techniques. Surface acidity and basicity were assessed by NH3 and CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) respectively that established high surface acidity and basicity of CN/SZ nanocatalyst. The reagent has shown supreme catalytic performance as only 0.2 wt% catalyst loading amount has provided 98.8% of biodiesel yield with 3:1 MeOH:Oil molar ratio at 65 °C for 2 h. Also, the reusability study has proved the efficacy of CN/SZ nanocatalyst that it can successfully be reused in five consecutive reaction cycles displaying promising results and the reactivated catalyst provided remarkably high biodiesel yield of 96.8%. Further, the mechanistic pathway of the simultaneous catalytic esterification of free fatty acid and transesterification of triglyceride occurring on catalyst surface has also been explored. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In order to treat waste during oleic acid production, pyrolysis method was used to investigate the plant oil asphalt (POA) to obtain bio-fuel. It was found that the compounds contained alkane, alkene, fatty acid, plant sterol derivatives, alcohol and etc. in pyrolysis products of POA by Pyrolysis-Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (Py-GC-MS). The Electrospray Ionization Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (ESI FT-ICR-MS) results showed that dehydrogenation and polymerization reactions took place during the pyrolysis process, but the main reaction was decarboxylation. According to van Krevelen diagram the nature of the bio-fuel can be evaluated. The acid value and viscosity of the resulting bio-fuel produced were higher than that of diesel fuel and reference bio-fuel. The calorific value showed a slight lower value than that of diesel oil. These studies nominated POA as a potential renewable feedstock for bio-fuel production the simple pyrolysis method. © 2020 Energy Institute

AB  - Hydrogen is recognized as zero-carbon fuel having the highest calorific value per unit mass as compared to other fuels. Butanol is also a promising biofuel having better fuel characteristics as compared to bioethanol. Thus, aim of the present study was concomitant hydrogen and n-butanol production via codigestion of organic wastewater such as cane molasses (CM), distillery effluent (DE) and starchy wastewater (SWW) and nitrogenous residues. The addition of co-substrate to organic wastewater has resulted in 12.2, 1.1 and 6.6 folds increase in hydrogen production in comparison to CM, DE and SWW, respectively as the sole substrate. Maximum energy conversion efficiency and positive net energy gain of 50.16% and 7.29 KJ gCOD−1, respectively were achieved using SWW supplemented with water hyacinth (WH). Acid pretreatment of WH leads to higher hydrogen and butanol production of 3160 mL L−1 and 4.5 g L−1, respectively with 89% energy conversion efficiency. This study shows the suitability of SWW with acid treated WH as feedstock for sustainable and efficient bioenergy generation with an additional advantage of waste management. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - The effect of temperature (300–650 °C) on the bio-oil quality and yields during pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse was investigated. Results showed that temperature had a profound influence on the pyrolysis products’ yields and bio-oil quality. Elemental analyses of bio-char and bio-oil showed that the carbon content in bio-char increased from 15.25% to 19.31% with increase in temperature from 300 °C to 500 °C and then decreased to 19.18% at 600 °C. Bio-oil and bio-char yields were seen to increase and decrease with an increase in pyrolysis temperature, respectively. Highest bio-oil yield (56.6% wt) was achieved at 500 °C while maximum amounts of bio-char (53.5% wt) and gas (32.9% wt) were obtained at 300 °C followed by at 400 °C. Highest HHV for bio-char (11.78 MJ/kg) was recorded at 500 °C, which decreased with further increase in temperature to 600 °C. Conversely, highest HHV for bio-oil (25.91 MJ/kg) was obtained at 300 °C. The obtained bio-oils were enriched in lignin derivatives and sugars oligomers and their concentration increased with increase in temperatures from 450 to 550 °C. FTIR spectra revealed the presence of aromatics, ethers, alkanes, alkenes and other alcohols in bio-char. Whilst alcohols, alkenes, ethers and other alcohols were noticed in the bio-oil. The complete absence of aromatics in bio-oil facilitates long-term stability of the bio-oil. These results suggest that good yields and high-quality bio-oil from sugarcane bagasse could be obtained at pyrolysis temperature of 550 °C. However, for an efficient pyrolysis process with relatively high bio-oil yields, pyrolysis reactor should be operated at 450 °C. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Crude glycerol as a promising feedstock for microbial lipid production contains several impurities that make it toxic stress inducer at high amount. Under stress conditions, microorganisms can accumulate l-proline as a safeguard. Herein, l-proline was assessed as an anti-stress agent in crude glycerol media. Results: Crude glycerol was converted to microbial lipids by the oleaginous yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides CGMCC 2.1389 in a two-staged culture mode. The media was supplied with exogenous l-proline to improve lipid production efficiency in high crude glycerol stress. An optimal amount of 0.5 g/L l-proline increased lipid titer and lipid yield by 34% and 28%, respectively. The lipid titer of 12.2 g/L and lipid content of 64.5% with a highest lipid yield of 0.26 g/g were achieved with l-proline addition, which were far higher than those of the control, i.e., lipid titer of 9.1 g/L, lipid content of 58% and lipid yield of 0.21 g/g. Similarly, l-proline also improved cell growth and glycerol consumption. Moreover, fatty acid compositional profiles of the lipid products was found suitable as a potential feedstock for biodiesel production. Conclusion: Our study suggested that exogenous l-proline improved cell growth and lipid production on crude glycerol by R.Toruloides. The fact that higher lipid yield as well as glycerol consumption indicated that l-proline might act as a potential anti-stress agent for the oleaginous yeast strain. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Camelina sativa (gold-of-pleasure) is a traditional European oilseed crop and emerging biofuel source with high levels of desirable fatty acids. A twentieth century germplasm bottleneck depleted genetic diversity in the crop, leading to recent interest in using wild relatives for crop improvement. However, little is known about seed oil content and genetic diversity in wild Camelina species. Results: We used gas chromatography, environmental niche assessment, and genotyping-by-sequencing to assess seed fatty acid composition, environmental distributions, and population structure in C. sativa and four congeners, with a primary focus on the crop's wild progenitor, C. microcarpa. Fatty acid composition differed significantly between Camelina species, which occur in largely non-overlapping environments. The crop progenitor comprises three genetic subpopulations with discrete fatty acid compositions. Environment, subpopulation, and population-by-environment interactions were all important predictors for seed oil in these wild populations. A complementary growth chamber experiment using C. sativa confirmed that growing conditions can dramatically affect both oil quantity and fatty acid composition in Camelina. Conclusions: Genetics, environmental conditions, and genotype-by-environment interactions all contribute to fatty acid variation in Camelina species. These insights suggest careful breeding may overcome the unfavorable FA compositions in oilseed crops that are predicted with warming climates. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Today, biofuels are indispensable in the implementation of fossil fuels replacement processes. This study evaluates ethyl acetate (EA) as a solvent of two straight vegetable oils (SVOs), castor oil (CO), and sunflower oil (SO), in order to obtain EA/SVO double blends that can be used directly as biofuels, or along with fossil diesel (D), in the current compression-ignition (C.I.) engines. The interest of EA as oxygenated additive lies not only in its low price and renewable character, but also in its very attractive properties such as low kinematic viscosity, reasonable energy density, high oxygen content, and rich cold flow properties. Revelant fuel properties of EA/SVO double and D/EA/SVO triple blends have been object of study including kinematic viscosity, pour point (PP), cloud point (CP), calorific value (CV), and cetane number (CN). The suitability of using these blends as fuels has been tested by running them on a diesel engine electric generator, analyzing their effect on engine power output, fuel consumption, and smoke emissions. Results obtained indicate that the D/EA/SO and D/EA/CO triple blends, composed by up to 24% and 36% EA, respectively, allow a fossil diesel substitution up to 60–80% providing power values very similar to conventional diesel.In addition, in exchange of a slight fuel consumption, a very notable lessening in the emission of pollutants as well as a better behavior at low temperatures, as compared to diesel, are achieved. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - A three-year experiment was carried out in Central Greece to assess the use of different tillage practices (Conventional, Reduced, and No tillage) for seedbed preparation, in a double cropping per year rotation of irrigated and rainfed energy crops for biomass production for first- and second-generation biofuel production. A life cycle assessment (LCA) study was performed for the first year of crop rotation to evaluate the environmental impact of using different tillage practices, identifying the processes with greater influence on the overall environmental burden (hotspots) and demonstrating the potential environmental benefits from the land management change. LCA results revealed that fertilizer application and diesel fuel consumption, as well as their production stages, were the hot-spot processes for each treatment. In the present study, different tillage treatments compared using mass- and area-based functional unit (FU), revealing that reduced tillage, using strip tillage for spring crop and disc harrow for winter crops, and no tillage treatment had the best environmental performance, respectively. Comparison between the prevailing in the area monoculture cotton crop with the proposed double energy crop rotation adopting conservation tillage practices, using mass and energy value FU, showed that cotton crop had higher environmental impact. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Algae biomass, a biofuel feedstock with potential to reduce global CO2 emissions, is currently too expensive Nitrogen, a significant input and life cycle cost, requires research on recycling and additional sources to reduce costs. Integral to nitrogen recycling is the knowledge of actual nitrogen requirements in outdoor ponds, thus data from the Unified Field Studies of the Algae Testbed Public-Private Partnership was analyzed. The data showed that Nannochloropsis oceanica used 14–24 mg/L NH4+ per harvest cycle for robust growth. Nitrogen recycled directly from the algae conversion process will likely be the primary source of nitrogen for algae cultivation. Harvested algae can be fractionated via Combined Algal Processing (CAP), where algae are pretreated, fermented, and the fuel feedstocks (e. g. ethanol, lipids) are removed leaving a nitrogen rich slurry. Chlorella vulgaris grew robustly in nitrogen-free media supplemented with CAP residues through 4 harvest cycles with no inhibition. The amount of nitrogen as free ammonium available for recycling directly without further processing was insufficient (~4% of total needed), thus the nitrogen fixing bacteria, Azotobacter vinelandii, was investigated as a means for increasing ammonium concentration in CAP residues. This organism was shown to be proficient at growth on sugars liberated from algae biomass during pretreatment and sustained algae growth using A. vinelandii supernatants was also demonstrated. Using Azotobacter to increase ammonium concentrations on-site using an inexpensive biological process to generate the necessary ammonium for outdoor algae cultivation improves sustainability of algae biofuels by avoiding the energy intensive steps of typical ammonium production and transport. These results show that byproducts of algae conversion begin to close nitrogen demand and, with further supplementation by diazotrophic bacteria or protein hydrolysis, may completely replace current energy-intensive and costly industrial nitrogen sources offering a path to increased economic feasibility and improved life cycle analysis of algae-based biofuels. © 2020

AB  - The purpose of this investigation is to clarify the combustion performance and exhaust emissions characteristics of biodiesel fueled compression ignition diesel engine under various intake air temperature and injection timing conditions. In order to clearly figure out the effect of intake air temperature, the flow rate of intake air was controlled at constant value before heating air. In addition, the engine speed and fuel injection quantity were fixed. Hence, the charging efficiency is constant even if the intake air temperature changes. At the injection timing BTDC 6° and 9°, high IMEPnet occurred and less NOX and HC were emitted. Here, as the intake air temperature increased, the vaporization characteristics of the fuel were improved and the ignition timing advanced close to TDC. Also, it was confirmed that the combustion duration prolonged. As a result, when the intake air temperature increases from 20 °C to 100 °C, IMEPnet increased slightly (0.39 → 0.41 MPa) owing to decreasing negative work and THC (0.85 → 0.51 g/kWh) and CO (3.72 → 1.34 g/kWh) emissions decreased, but NOX emission increased slightly (3.69 → 4.82 g/kWh). In addition, although the diameter of the most emitted PM increased relatively, the number decreased. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Previous studies in Siberian apricot (Prunus sibirica) seed kernel (SASK) have suggested the involvement of abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway in oil accumulation. However, there are few reports on the effects of ABA on the metabolism of fatty acids (FA) in seed development. Here, we first evaluated the response of developing SASK to ABA treatment, with a focus on oil content, FA composition, biodiesel properties, lipid compounds and gene expressions. Compared with control samples, the application of exogenous ABA increased the total oil content by 6.55% in mature SASK. The C18:1 content markedly increased in ABA treatment, and conversely C16:0 decreased. Exogenous ABA also improved the biodiesel properties of SASK oil, making it better suited to the specifications of biodiesel standards. Furthermore, the molecular species of phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidic acid (PA), diacylglycerol (DAG) and triacylglycerol (TAG) were detected using lipidomics analysis. The 18:1/18:1 was the main component in PA, PC and DAG, while the main components of 18:1/18:1/18:2, 18:1/18:1/18:3, 18:2/18:2/18:2 and 18:1/18:1/18:1 in TAG. Most lipid species gradually increased with SASK maturity. In addition, the relative contents of TAG-18:1/18:1/18:2 and TAG-18:1/18:1/18:1 in developing SASK increased with the application of exogenous ABA. We also detected elevated gene expression of key genes involved in ABA chemical pathway, which likely affected FA biosynthesis and accumulation. Our results provide insight into the effects of ABA on the oil accumulation in developing SASK, which has direct applications to improving the quality of SASK-derived biodiesel. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Within the so-called bioliq® process, renewable carbon resources, especially agricultural residues, are converted to gasoline. The process chain comprises pyrolysis of the feedstocks, gasification to synthesis gas, gas cleaning and conversion of synthesis gas to dimethyl ether (DME) followed by conversion of DME to hydrocarbons. Construction of all process units has been completed now and the entire plant has been successfully operated in several campaigns. Thus, hundreds of liters of a new alternative gasoline are available now, which allow for an extensive testing. The basic characteristics of the resulting bioliq®/100 fuel are described. It is rich in aromatics and a blend consisting of 90 Vol.−% of conventional RON95 E5 fuel and 10 Vol.−% of bioliq®/100, designated as bioliq®/10, has been produced which meets the DIN EN 228 standard. Initial measurements on a single cylinder research engine have been carried out focusing on efficiency and emissions. A comparison of bioliq®/10 with neat RON95 E5 revealed an improved knocking behavior of bioliq®/10 even by a small fraction of regenerative bioliq® fuel. Particle as well as hydrocarbon emissions from bioliq®/10 are significantly higher than in the case of RON95 E5. Increased particle emissions are attributed to the higher content of aromatics. Soot reactivity has been investigated and soot from bioliq®/10 exhibits higher reactivity than soot from RON95 E5. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ignition delay times of a gasoline surrogate (iso-octane/toluene/n-heptane/1-hexene at 55/25/15/5% by liquid volume, developed in McCormick et al. 2017) with high-level bioblendstock-gasoline surrogate blends (50% and 85% biofuel by liquid volume of each ethanol and methyl acetate) were collected behind reflected shock waves. Post-reflected-shock temperatures ranged from 968 to 1361 K at pressures of about 4, 10, 25, and 50 atm. Data were collected for real fuel–air mixtures at fuel lean and stoichiometric conditions (φ = 0.5, 1.0) with focus on the more-practical, fuel-lean conditions. Ignition delay times were measured from OH* chemiluminescence around 307 nm using an endwall diagnostic. The RON and MON of the surrogate were 90.3 and 84.7, respectively. Ethanol was chosen due to its wide use in flex-fuel vehicles and availability, while also providing an increased octane rating. Methyl acetate was chosen for its especially high octane rating to investigate the effect of an extreme case. To validate the gasoline surrogate, the data are compared to real gasoline (RD387) and several gasoline surrogate experiments from the literature. Using the wide range of pressures studied, the gasoline surrogate's pressure dependence was quantified to account for test-to-test variations using regression analysis. Similarly, a global correlation for gasoline and its surrogates was developed using all available data from the literature. Two modern chemical kinetics models targeting gasoline and its surrogates are compared to the ignition delay time measurements. These new high-pressure, high-bioblendstock concentration tests provide required chemical kinetic data for optimizing fuel and engine design. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The lipids produced by oleaginous microbes are considered sustainable resources for biofuels. To facilitate controlled lipid production and lipid analysis, more efficient lipid extraction methods are required. This study describes the automated pressurized liquid extraction (APLE) method for lipid extraction from dried cells of the oleaginous yeast species Rhodosporidium toruloides and Cryptococcus curvatus. Cells were mixed with diatomite in a mortar, added to the sample chamber, and treated with a mixture of chloroform and methanol at 105 °C. More than 95% lipids were extracted. Analysis by using high-performance thin-layer chromatography showed that the neutral lipid contents in the obtained samples by APLE method were similar to those by the ball milling–assisted extraction method. The lipids had an essentially identical fatty acid composition compared with lipids extracted with the acid-heating extraction (AHE) method. This demonstrated that lipids can be efficiently extracted from oleaginous yeasts in less time and without harsh pretreatment procedures. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Currently, there is an effort to achieve a more widespread use of biofuels, which are an alternative to conventional, petroleum-based fuels in mobile and stationary applications. The conversion of vegetable oils via catalytic hydrotreating to hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) is one of the most promising alternatives to produce high-quality biofuels. In this work, the composition and properties of rapeseed oil hydrotreating products gained over sulfided CoMo/γ-Al2O3 and NiMo/γ-Al2O3 catalysts were studied. The experiments were carried out in a laboratory trickle bed reactor in a temperature range of 320-380 °C and pressures of 4 and 8 MPa. The mixture of a rapeseed oil and isooctane was hydrotreated to simulate the coprocessing of rapeseed oil and petroleum fractions. Small amounts of aromatic hydrocarbons and, at higher reaction temperatures, considerably high contents of cycloalkanes and isoalkanes were found in the obtained liquid products. These were specifically alkylated cyclopentanes, cyclohexanes, decalines, benzenes, indanes, tetralines, and naphthalenes. The content of isoalkanes and aromatics in the liquid hydrotreating products gained over both catalysts increased with an increasing reaction temperature. A higher total amount of aromatics was found in the products of the NiMo catalyst because of its higher dehydrogenation activity compared with the CoMo catalyst. The liquid products with a high content of n-alkanes had a very high cetane index and cold filter plugging point, which decreased with an increasing reaction temperature due to the increasing content of isoalkanes and aromatics.

AB  - Thermochemical process routes are promising technological routes to convert lignocellulosic biomass into biofuels with similar properties as fossil fuels. In a previous work (Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 2018 57, 9925-9942), we have studied five base case processes for biofuel production with fixed process structures. This work presents an integrated methodology to consider new process structures for the optimal synthesis of lignocellulosic biomass-to-liquid (BtL) fuel production processes. Given that the five base cases showed not only a significant difference of production costs among the process sections but also distinct biofuel product profiles in terms of gasoline and diesel productivity, the current methodology is developed in two parts: part 1 presents the superstructure synthesis through the step-by-step definition of unit operations' possible interconnections to include all possible new process alternatives than base cases. The superstructure is developed based on the data collected from unit operations' rigorous simulation of the base cases. Part 2 presents the superstructure algorithm setup and optimization for the optimal synthesis of BtL process flowsheets with specified product profiles of gasoline and diesel productivity. Rigorous simulation results for process units and process sections are used in the superstructure formulation and its algorithm development. Three case studies have shown that the integrated methodology can generate new production processes with specified product profiles while having lower total manufacturing costs than base cases.

AB  - Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are credible alternatives for ionic liquids. Most DESs have favourable properties such as lower production cost, biodegradability and are environmental friendly. In this work, tetraethylene glycol (TTEG)-based DESs were successfully prepared by mixing TTEG and choline chloride at different molar ratios. The physicochemical properties such as conductivity, freezing point, density, surface tension and viscosity were measured at temperatures between 298.15 K and 353.15 K. It was found that the molar ratio of both compounds affected the physicochemical properties. As the solubility of unsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acid and linoleic acid, in these DESs are industrially significant, this property became an important consideration. Computer simulations using the COSMO-RS program which is based on the interpretation of the σ-profiles, as well as the evaluation of Gibbs energy change of mixing were in excellent agreement with the experimental results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on TTEG-based DESs which were used to dissolve unsaturated fatty acids. This work could introduce a new perspective in lipids chemistry, biofuel production, food processing and vegetable oil extraction. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The polarity and polarizability of fuel blend components determine some of the blend physical properties, such as viscosity, surface tension, fluidity or miscibility. This affects the development of the injected fuel jet and, therefore, the performance and pollutant formation in diesel engines. Among polar molecules, such as alcohols (ethanol and butanol), attractive forces exist between dipolar ends with opposite charges. The permanent molecular dipoles lead to the formation of induced dipoles in neighbouring molecules, which interact with the permanent dipoles forming intermolecular attraction. Although less appreciable, interaction between non-polar molecules also occurs in diesel fuels. In this study, the dielectric properties were investigated in the terahertz spectral region (located between infrared and microwaves). This region is typical for vibrational and rotational studies of molecules of non-conductive materials. For all blends tested, the time-domain terahertz spectra show that the amplitude of pulses decreases and the peak position shifts in time as alcohol content increases. For diesel and biodiesel fuels, amplitudes are higher and less delayed than for alcohols, indicating that they are less radiation-absorbing. The optical and dielectric properties (absorption coefficient, refraction index and dielectric constant) of alcohol blends with diesel and biodiesel blends were determined. For the alcohols studied, both absorption coefficient and refractive index decrease for increasing alkyl chain length. Real and imaginary terms of the complex dielectric function show increasing dependency with frequency as the molecule polarity increases. From these properties, the relaxation dynamics can be modelled for blends, and nonlinearities in their physical properties can be explained. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is a renewable biofuel suitable for diesel replacement. Biodiesel has in its composition unsaturated fatty esters making it easily degraded. The objective of the present work was to investigate biodiesel thermal-oxidation by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Using the NMR was possible to analyze the signal intensities of the olefinic, bis-allylic and allylic protons of the chemical bonds, obtain the oleic, linoleic, linolenic and saturated acyl groups proportions, observe and classify some oxidation products. Two sets of biodiesel were analyzed, the first was oxidize in the Rancimat equipment at 110 °C during 8 h, and the second was oxidized in an oven at 50 °C during 17 days. The biodiesel oxidized at 110 °C had a more expressive degradation when compared to the samples oxidized at 50 °C. The samples presented an increase in the saturated proportion. It was possible to observe the formation of oxidation products as hydroperoxides and aldehydes as propanal and 2-propenal. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrogen (H2) is an effective additive to improve the issue of low laminar burning velocity of some biofuels. In order to better understand the laminar burning characteristics of ethyl acetate (EA) with or without H2 addition, experimental investigations of laminar burning characteristics were carried out by using the high-speed Schlieren photography technique in a constant volume combustion chamber. Tests were conducted under various equivalence ratios ranging from 0.5 to 1.4 with an initial temperature of 358 K, an initial pressure of 0.1 MPa and a H2/air proportion of 0%, 4%, 8% and 12% by volume. Laminar burning velocities, together with other parameters such as laminar burning flux, flame thickness, Markstein length and Markstein number, were calculated and discussed. In addition, the experimental data were compared with numerical simulations based on the Dayma model. Results showed that the laminar burning velocity of EA was enhanced with the increase of H2 addition, and the maximum value reached 95.09 cm/s at φ = 0.6 with 12% H2, a value more than twice as fast as that of pure EA (39.3 cm/s). Moreover, H2 was found to extend the lower flammability limit of EA. The laminar burning velocities simulated with the Dayma model agreed well with the experimental results of EA at various H2 additions. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Hydropyrolysis is a vital step in IH2® technology for the production of fungible drop-in biofuels from biomass and waste feedstocks. Hydrogen at high pressures in fast hydropyrolysis aids in improving the H/C ratio of bio-oil through deoxygenation pathways such as dehydration, decarboxylation and decarbonylation. The main objectives of this study are to understand the composition of organics and the time evolution of various functional groups during fast hydropyrolysis of pine sawdust at different temperatures, pressures, and in the presence of a catalyst. Analytical fast pyrolysis experiments were conducted in a Pyroprobe® reactor interfaced with a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. At high hydrogen partial pressures (10 and 20 bar), significant production of hydrocarbons, in contrast to undesirable oxygen-containing compounds at low pressures, was observed. Moreover, it resulted in a minor increase in the yield of pyrolysates and char, while the yields of pyrolysates and char increased and decreased, respectively, as the temperature was increased at high hydrogen partial pressures. The overall yield of condensable pyrolysates from hydropyrolysis was notably higher as compared to that from pyrolysis in inert atmosphere. The use of a stainless steel catalyst tube in the Pyroprobe® improved the formation of hydrocarbons as compared to that of a quartz tube at high pressures. Upgradation of pyrolysis vapors evolved from hydropyrolysis of pine sawdust at 500 °C and 20 bar over the catalyst bed maintained at 500 °C resulted in selective production of aromatic hydrocarbons (12% C6, 32% C7, 20% C8, 9% C9, 7% C10, and 4% C11). The isothermal mass loss data at short residence times were obtained using the analytical Pyroprobe®, and the apparent rate constants were determined using a 3D-diffusion model. Pyrolysis-FTIR data substantiate the significant increase in methane production with the increase in pressure. Pyrolysate composition data from Py-FTIR and Py-GC/MS techniques at various pressures were assimilated to develop a reaction scheme to describe non-catalytic and catalytic hydropyrolysis of biomass. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - In the current study, a domestic diesel electricity generator based new thermoelectric cogeneration system is studied with a 20% blend of mahua biodiesel fuel. The exhaust of the engine is considered as the heat source with the rectangular configuration geometry of the exhaust pipe, for heating water and producing electricity using thermoelectric generators. A thermal resistance model is developed for five cases at different positions for thermoelectric generators. The comparative study revealed that in Case 5, the maximum power of 35 W is obtained in which the TEGs are assembled with the inner wall of the rectangular exhaust configuration near to the heat source. However, the heat recovery unit could produce water temperatures up to 93°C. Furthermore, evaluation of the payback period and savings in cost by operating the cogeneration system has been done for all considered configurations of TEG based cogeneration systems. The theoretical analysis revealed that out of all the considered Cases, Case-5, TEGs near to the heat source, provides the best balance between the power and initial cost at sufficient water temperature. Furthermore, the study extends to the environmental impact of the cogeneration systems for the estimations of the CO2 saved by the waste heat. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Change in the climatic conditions due to uncontrolled emission of carbon dioxide is continuously encouraging to search alternative renewable energy sources. Corn stover is one of the several feedstocks being considered as growth medium for oil producing bacteria. India ranks third in the production of corn in the world. The present study focused on biodiesel synthesis from microbial oil, chemical profiling and evaluation of physicochemical properties of produced biodiesel. The bacterium was isolated from food waste resources and identified as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (MF510169) on the basis of morphological‚ biochemical characters and 16S rRNA sequencing. The bacterium B. amyloliquefaciens (MF510169) was grown on corn stover as an ideal agro-waste feedstock. The bacterium grown on corn stover peels revealed maximum lipid production after acid hydrolysis (0.25% HCl) over other feedstocks used under study. The bacterium produces 3.8% oil under operating parameters, i.e. inoculum size, density, carbon and nitrogen source, C/N ratio, temperature, pH, rotational speed and fermentation period. The oil was transesterified using sulphuric acid (0.12%) as a catalyst to form fatty acids methyl esters. Transesterification reaction was optimised at various parameters like catalyst type, catalyst loading, oil: methanol ratio, temperature and reaction time. The chemical profiling of FAMEs revealed hexadecanoic acid methyl ester, 9-1, 2 octadecanoic acid methyl ester, octadecanoic acid methyl ester and methyl stearate as characterised by using GC–MS, GC-FID, FTIR and NMR techniques. The physicochemical properties of transesterified biodiesel revealed 85% similarity with the ASTM International Standards. The produced biodiesel from Bacillus could be exploited at commercial level after successful engine trial tests. © 2020, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - Biodiesel quality is dependent upon the fatty acids distribution of the raw material used in the trans/esterification reactions. While microalgae cells are regarded as potential oil suppliers for the biodiesel production chain, a common criticism is related to the low lipid productivities and often to a poor fatty acid distribution. In the present work we propose to submit microalgal cultivation to a second stage with nutritional stress by a simple addition of a 70% nitrate source depleted medium at the beginning of stationary phase, without harvesting cells, saving time and water. Chlorella minutissima was cultivated in a novel unconventional photobioreactor, named Internally Illuminated Integrated Photobioreactor (ILI-PBR), to verify the efficiency of the proposed strategy. Biomass concentration, lipid content and volumetric lipids productivity increased 24.9%, 120.7% and 55.6%, respectively, from Stage 1 to Stage 2, when ILI-PBR was illuminated by constant blue LED and 0.5 vvm of aeration. The fatty acid profiles, evaluated in terms of LED illumination (white, red and blue), showed a predominance of palmitic acid in all cases (59.49%, 57.28% and 46.51%, respectively), which allowed to enhance some biodiesel properties such as cetane number, cold filter plugging point, density and kinematic viscosity, according to international specifications. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The increase in service temperature and the use of renewable but also more aggressive biofuels such as biodiesel have remarkably raised demands for the durability of polymer components used in automotive fuel systems. The commonly used aliphatic polyamides (PAs) can here be problematic to use in (bio)diesel systems at high temperature in locations such as fuel pipes and fuel filter housings. In the present work, the ageing behaviour of a new class of easily melt-processable glass fibre-reinforced highly-biobased semi-aromatic polyamides (polyphthalamide, PPA) was investigated in very demanding environments (petroleum diesel (B0) and its commercial blend with 20 vol% biodiesel (B20)) at high temperature. The results showed that the PPA matrix had better barrier properties towards both petroleum and bio-based diesel compared to conventional PA12, as revealed by its lower and slower fuel uptake. The sorbed fuels plasticized the composite, decreasing the glass transition temperature (Tg), with B20 having a larger plasticizing effect on PPA than B0. Notably, the mechanical properties of the PPA composite were not negatively affected even after long exposure to both B0 and B20. This was due to the low level of fuel uptake, high Tg and intact interface between the glass fibres and PPA matrix. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Scale-up and commercialization of biodiesel is often delimited by costly feedstock that adds up to the process costs. These underlying issues demand the exploration of unconventional cheap feed to improve the process economics. Conversion of waste cooking oil (WCO) into biodiesel could reduce the process costs by 60–70%. However, the continuous exposure to heat during frying leads to oxidation as well increase in the free fatty acid (FFA) content which intensifies the time and energy required for transesterification. The present study analyzes the effect of parameters over the conversion of WCO (with 8.17% FFA) into biodiesel via two-step acid-alkali-based microwave-assisted transesterification. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the oil:methanol volume ratio, microwave power, and reaction time during the acid-catalyzed esterification to bring down the FFA below 1%. Microwave irradiation of 250 W, with methanol:oil molar ratio of 19.57:1 [oil:methanol volume ratio of 1.31 (expressed as decimal)] and reaction time of 35 s, resulted in 0.082% of FFA. Alkali-catalyzed transesterification with methanol:oil molar ratio of 5:1 with 2% sodium hydroxide at 65 °C thereby produced fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) with the volumetric biodiesel yield of 94.6% in 30 min. Physiochemical properties of the transesterified WCO were well comparable with the biodiesel standards. The study highlights the essentiality of multivariate optimization for the esterification process that could aid in understanding the interactive effects of variables over FFA content. Such studies would benefit in scaling up of the transesterification process at industrial level by improving the economics of the overall bioprocess. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The present article demonstrates designing of novel catalyst, 12-tungstosilicic acid (TSA) anchored to ordered nano-porous MCM-48 (nMCM-48); TSA/nMCM-48, characterization and evaluation for synthesis of bio-fuel additives via glycerol valorisation with aromatic aldehydes. The nanopores of support were confirmed by BET and TEM while the interaction between TSA and nMCM-48 was confirmed by decrease in the surface area and pore volume of the catalysts. Assessment of vital reaction parameters (% loading of active species, mole ratio of reactants, catalyst amount, temperature and time) were performed to achieve maximum conversion of glycerol. The catalyst showed noteworthy performance at 30 °C towards conversion (>85 %) and thermodynamically stable dioxane derivative (>60 %) with remarkable TON (5945 for benzaldehyde and 7355 for furfural). The catalyst was regenerated and used for successive four catalytic runs with almost same activity. The superiority of novel catalyst is because of its geometry and nano porosity. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The deployment of low-carbon energy (LCE) technologies and management of installations represents an imperative to face climate change. LCE planning is an interminable process affected by a multitude of social, economic, environmental, and health factors. A major challenge for policy makers is to select a future clean energy strategy that maximizes sustainability. Thus, policy formulation and evaluation need to be addressed in an analytical manner including multidisciplinary knowledge emanating from diverse social stakeholders. In the current work, a comparative analysis of LCE planning is provided, evaluating different multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) methodologies. Initially, by applying strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis, the available energy alternative technologies are prioritized. A variety of stakeholders is surveyed for that reason. To deal with the ambiguity that occurred in their judgements, fuzzy goal programming (FGP) is used for the translation into fuzzy numbers. Then, the stochastic fuzzy analytic hierarchical process (SF-AHP) and fuzzy technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (F-TOPSIS) are applied to evaluate a repertoire of energy alternative forms including biofuel, solar, hydro, and wind power. The methodologies are estimated based on the same set of tangible and intangible criteria for the case study of Thessaly Region, Greece. The application of FGP ranked the four energy types in terms of feasibility and positioned solar-generated energy as first, with a membership function of 0.99. Among the criteria repertoire used by the stakeholders, the SF-AHP evaluated all the criteria categories separately and selected the most significant category representative. Finally, F-TOPSIS assessed these criteria ordering the energy forms, in terms of descending order of ideal solution, as follows: solar, biofuel, hydro, and wind. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Environmental obligation, fuel security, and human health issues have fuelled the search for locally produced sustainable transport fuels as an alternative to liquid petroleum. This study evaluates the sustainability performance of various alternative energy sources, namely, ethanol, electricity, electricity-gasoline hybrid, and hydrogen, forWestern Australian road transport using a life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) framework. The framework employs 11 triple bottom line (TBL) sustainability indicators and uses threshold values for benchmarking sustainability practices. A number of improvement strategies were devised based on the hotspots once the alternative energy sources failed to meet the sustainability threshold for the determined indicators. The proposed framework effectively addresses the issue of interdependencies between the three pillars of sustainability, which was an inherent weakness of previous frameworks. The results show that the environment-friendly and socially sustainable energy options, namely, ethanol-gasoline blend E55, electricity, electricity-E10 hybrid, and hydrogen, would need around 0.02, 0.14, 0.10, and 0.71 AUD/VKT of financial support, respectively, to be comparable to gasoline. Among the four assessed options, hydrogen shows the best performance for the environmental and social bottom line when renewable electricity is employed for hydrogen production. The economic sustainability of hydrogen fuel is, however, uncertain at this stage due to the high cost of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs). The robustness of the proposed framework warrants its application in a wide range of alternative fuel assessment scenarios locally as well as globally. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Diethyl ether (DEE) has been proposed as a biofuel additive for compression-ignition engines, as an ignition improver for homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engines, and as a suitable component for dual-fuel mixtures in reactivity-controlled compression ignition (RCCI) engines. The combustion in these engines is significantly controlled by low-temperature (LT) chemistry. Fundamental studies of DEE LT oxidation chemistry and of its influence in fuel-mixture oxidation are thus highly important, especially at elevated pressures. Elevated pressure speciation data were measured for the LT oxidation of DEE, of its similarly-structured linear five-heavy-atom hydrocarbon fuel (n-pentane), and of a mixture of the two fuels in a jet-stirred reactor (JSR) in the temperature range of 400-1100 K and at various pressures up to 10 bar. The pressure influence on the LT oxidation chemistry of DEE was investigated by a comparison of the measured profiles of oxidation products. The results for DEE and n-pentane were then inspected with regard to fuel structure influences on the LT oxidation behavior. The new speciation data were used to test recent kinetic models for these fuels [Tran et al., Proc. Combust. Inst. 37 (2019) 511 and Bugler et al., Proc. Combust. Inst. 36 (2017) 441]. The models predict the major features of the LT chemistry of these fuels well and could thus subsequently assist in the data interpretation. Finally, the LT oxidation behavior of an equimolar mixture of the two fuels was explored. The interaction between the two fuels and the effects of the pressure on the fuel mixture oxidation were examined. In addition to reactions within the combined model for the two fuels, about 80 cross-reactions between primary reactive species generated from these two fuel molecules were added to explore their potential influences. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020.

AB  - Mixtures with high fatty acid content are produced during vegetable oil and animal fat purification and paper production. These waste fractions can be converted into alternative fuels through several steps. The co-hydrogenation of waste polypropylene thermal cracked fraction or waste fatty acid mixture with unrefined gas oils is a potential solution for their conversion into hydrocarbons. The co-processing of these three different fractions was not yet investigated in these ratios. So the aim of the research work was to produce high quality diesel fuels and to study the occurring reactions and the interaction among these different compounds. The catalytic conversion of the mixture of unrefined gas oil, waste polypropylene cracked fraction (20 wt %) and waste fatty acid mixture (10, 20 and 30 wt %) was carried out on a commercial sulphided nickel-molybdenum-alumina catalyst. The effect of the feedstock compositions and the process parameters on the quantity and quality of the products was studied. The favourable process conditions to produce high quality diesel fuel blending components were selected (e.g., 10 wt % fatty acid waste, 360 °C temperature, 1.0 h−1 liquid hourly space velocity). The performance properties of this fuel were better than the conventional diesels’, so their usage can be more environmentally friendly and lead to lower pollutant emission. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Increasing the content of biodiesel in the diesel fuel mixture faces some challenges due to the presence of steryl glucosides (SG) compounds, which causes the filter clogging and the reduction of engine power. In this study, coarse filter paper-based nanocrystalline cellulose (CFP-based NCC) with the crystallinity of 85.73% is selected as a potential adsorbent to separate SG compounds in palm-based biodiesel (PO–B100). The adsorption experiments were carried out at various CFP-based NCC to PO-B100 mass ratio (1:50, 1:75, 1:100, 1:125, 1:150, 1:175, 1:200) and temperature (65, 75, 85 °C). The maximum SG removal was 91.81%, obtained at 75 °C for CFP-based NCC to PO-B100 mass ratio of 1:50. The adsorption treatment also improves the cold stability of PO-B100 by reducing the cloud point from 13.2 °C to 11.5 °C. Langmuir isotherm model is best-fitted to the equilibrium adsorption data and thermodynamic studies suggested that the adsorption of SG onto the CFP-based NCC surface is spontaneous and endothermic. The isotherm and thermodynamic study showed that the mechanism governing the adsorption process may be driven by both dipole-dipole interactions and ion exchange. The adsorption results showed that CFP-based NCC has great affinity and selectivity to SG and can be considered as a promising adsorbent of SG. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The demand for biodiesel to reduce consumption of fossil fuels has motivated engineers to design a rapid and safe production process. However, the slow mass transfer of multiphase transesterification reaction hinders the overall reaction time. A continuous process using a microchannel reactor was proven to achieve complete reaction time in 40 s with high oil conversion of 98.6% due to the enhancement of mixing inside the methanol slug phase. The reaction was successfully performed at ambient room environment, without heating element in the reactor that reduces the design complexity and makes the operation energy efficient and safer. The enhancement of reaction was investigated based on the hydrodynamic factors such as interfacial area and mixing. Three-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation shows a torus-shaped recirculation structure inside methanol slug that enhances mixing. Microchannel reactor has been proven to enhance the mixing and capable in having faster, highly efficient, and safer process. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Wood pellets gain increasing importance as an alternative and renewable fuel. In this study, biodiesel absorbed pellets were used, which is a new method for usage of pellet fuels. In this way, the naturally existing pores in pellets are filled with biodiesel, which improves the combustion properties compared to untreated (raw) pellets. Raw and biodiesel absorbed pellets were burned in a domestic experimental boiler to analyse comparatively the combustion characteristics such as thermal power, efficiency and flue gas emissions. Additionally, the absorption capacity of pellet fuels was investigated. Flue gas temperature and emissions (CO2, O2, CO, SO2 and NOx) were measured in the chimney. Combustion efficiencies were calculated and compared with each other. Experiments were performed without any modifications to the boiler, which was set for raw pellet combustion. By the usage of biodiesel absorbed pellets, the thermal power input increased from 15.2 kW to 20.9 kW (nearly 37.5% more), whereas the thermal efficiency increased from 91.7% to 93%. The average flue gas temperature was about 89.6 °C and nearly 13 °C higher than raw pellet fuel. By biodiesel absorbed pellet, significantly more CO and slightly less NOx emission concentrations in flue gases were obtained. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The methods of life cycle assessment and cost-effectiveness analysis were employed to compare the energetic, environmental, and economic performances of three household-based modern bioenergy (MBE) utilization systems: biogas utilization (BGs), biomass briquette utilization for energy only (BBs), and biomass briquette utilization for energy and biochar (BCs). The results showed that all the three MBEs performed positive results in net energy output, which ranged from 0.86 to 3.75 MJ (kg crop residues)−1. The positive greenhouse gas reductions also can be acquired when using these three MBEs to substitute for traditional energy, respectively. The cost-effectiveness values of three MBE systems ranged from 343 RMB (tCO2e)−1 for BGs to 598 RMB (tCO2e)−1 for BCs (the CO2e indicates the CO2 equivalent). Considering the supply index analysis results furtherly, the BGs is regarded as the best strategy for the development of MBE in rural households. However, BG leakage during BG digester operations should be received much greater attention to avoid adverse impacts on GHG mitigation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biomass utilization is expected to play a crucial role in sustainable development by addressing issues related to food security, climate change, and resource utilization. In this context, bioeconomy represents a pivotal concept for necessary innovations in the primary economic sectors. This article reviews the key drivers of bioeconomy - from biogas energy to first generation biofuels - that find stable performance in automobiles. Included in the discussion is the utilization of wastewater streams that produce bioelectricity by decomposing the organic substrates using microbial metabolisms. Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) can help achieve such conversions and further the electrochemical kinetics that govern biochemical reactions in MFCs. The scope of sustainable development for bioeconomy value chains paves the way for bio-based chemical production, applications in food, technology, and manufacturing. The development of these pathways is critical for exploiting new resources from renewable biomass and allows speculation about the transition to a sustainable society by reducing the use of fossil resources. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.

AB  - The present experimental investigation is devoted to optimize the nozzle geometry and compression ratio on single cylinder DI diesel engine fuelled with Fish Oil Methyl Ester (FOME) biodiesel. The FOME biodiesel with 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% are blended with diesel. The experiments have been conducted at three compression ratios 16.5:1, 17.5:1 and 18.5:1 at 240 bar and 260 bar IOP (Injection Opening Pressure) with 3 holes and 4 holes fuel injectors having 0.20 mm and 0.25 mm orifice diameter respectively. And these results are compared with pure diesel. The experimental results showed that the biodiesel blends have slightly lesser brake thermal efficiency and reduced smoke emissions in contrast to pure diesel. The blend B40D60 gives better results in comparison to all other blends with respect to brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and smoke emissions at compression ratio (CR) 17.5:1 and 4 hole fuel injector having 0.25 mm diameter at 260 bar IOP. Hence this is the optimized blend operating condition for improved brake thermal efficiency (27.15%) of FOME biodiesel with reduced smoke (14.34 HSU) emissions. © 2020

AB  - Biodiesel is among the biofuels. In this study, biodiesel was produced from Iranian bitter almond (BAO) oil through the transesterification process by using ethanol (BAO ethyl ester). BAO can be considered a non-edible oil, so this parameter can add to the benefits of biodiesel production. Biodiesel was prepared in two samples, containing 5 and 20 volumetric percent of biodiesel in diesel fuel respectively (B5 and B20). The tests were done based on the ECE R-85 standard. According to this standard, the engine test is performed at four loads (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) and two rotational speeds, 1400 rpm and 2000 rpm. These correspond to the maximum torque and power respectively. Experimental tests were run on engine performance and emissions of biodiesel fuels. The results were studied and all the parameters were compared with diesel fuel. According to the results, the maximum brake power increased (about 9.5% compared with diesel fuel) in B20, at a load of 20% and a rotational speed of 2000 rpm. Also the maximum reduction of BSFC (about 8.6% lower than diesel fuel) happened for B20 at a load of 25% and a rotational speed of 2000 rpm. Although, the brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) decreased at a rotational speed of 2000 rpm and all loads for both B5 and B20 compared with diesel. Regarding the effect of biodiesel on engine emissions, the emission of nitrogen oxide (NOx) at all loads for both B5 and B20 was greater than that for diesel fuel. The carbon dioxide (CO2) emission of the engine was lower for B5 at a rotational speed of 2000 rpm and at all loads compared with diesel fuel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The large-scale culture of microalgae has become a focus of interest for the biorefinery industry, combining the production of biofuels with that of other value-added bioproducts and thus increasing the profitability of the process. In order to evaluate its potential as biodiesel feedstock under a biorefinery approach, the biomass, pigment, nutrient, total lipid and lipid fraction kinetics of the Argentinian Nannochloropsis oceanica CCALA 978 strain were analysed. The species was first cultivated under optimal conditions (f/2 medium) and then transferred to nutritional stress conditions (N-deprivation or P-deprivation media). Under complete f/2 medium, N. oceanica presented maximum growth rate (μ) and chlorophyll-a values and minimum values for lipid and carotenoid content. The high nutrient consumption rate (N or P) in this exponential phase was associated with increasing cell density. Under both nitrate and phosphate deprivation, μ was drastically reduced but biomass production reached its highest values, indicating a phase of metabolite accumulation. Maximum values of total lipids (ca. 39% dw) and carotenoids (1100 × 10−3 ± 15 μg mL−1) were obtained under nitrate deprivation. In addition, total lipid composition was characterized by 92% neutral lipids, 0.7% phospholipids, a high percentage of C16:1 (ca. 37% of total fatty acids) and minimum values of PUFA (5.9% of total fatty acids). Biodiesel properties inferred from the fatty acid methyl ester profile of neutral lipids meet the standards established by EN 14214 and ASTMD 6751-08. Although N and P deficiency both produced an increase in neutral lipids in the studied strain, under a biorefinery approach, nitrate deprivation is considered to be a better method of stress induction than phosphate deprivation for the purpose of co-producing neutral lipids for biodiesel and value-added pigments. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Spirulina is a potential feedstock for biofuel production and rich source of other valuable products such as lipid, reduced sugar and protein content. The aim of this study is to achieve the maximum lipid yield and other value added products from lipid extracted Spirulina by using different techniques. The parameters, pre-treatment of ultra sonication, drying techniques and methods of cell disruption techniques were studied with respect to the biochemical properties. The cell disruption techniques involving temperature and pressure for disruption opted were autoclave, microwave and conventional heating processes. The techniques were analysed for considerable amount of lipid yield. The interaction between drying techniques and pre-treatment with cell disruption techniques were also investigated by two way ANOVA. The effect on morphology of disrupted cell was observed by scanning electron microscopy characterization. The study revealed that the oven dried biomass resulted in better yield of protein and lipid as compared to sun dried biomass. In case of reduced sugar, the fresh algal cell and microwave assisted cell biomass were found to give better yield for sun dried biomass. The experimental data revealed that among used methods for lipid extraction, the microwave and conventional heating methods were found to be the best out of the techniques used for lipid extraction and reduced sugar yield. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass derived from non-food crops cultivated on lands that are increasingly marginal for more favoured major crops is a potential source of sustainable renewable energy. This study explores the transformation of crude organic phase pyrolytic oil derived from Napier grass biomass into high-grade biofuel precursors via hydrodeoxygenation reaction over platinum and palladium catalysts with in-situ hydrogen generation from methanol. The reaction was conducted in a high-pressure stainless steel batch reactor at 350 °C, 20 wt% methanol ratio, 2 wt% catalyst loading and 60 min reaction time. The result of physicochemical analysis showed that the higher heating value of the organic liquid products collected over the catalysts increased by 35–40% relative to the raw sample. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry results revealed significant reductions in the oxygenated compounds such as methoxyaromatics, methoxyphenols, acids, aldehydes. The degree of deoxygenation and overall extent of upgrading observed was 50–54% and 56–60%, respectively. The gas products collected were mainly carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen and methane. Hydrodeoxygenation, hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, dehydration, demethylation, hydrocracking, decarbonylation and decarboxylation were the main upgrading reactions, and a multiple reaction network was proposed. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - In the context of Brazil's rising energy-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, we develop a forward-looking analysis of the domestic renewable energy policy framework. We probe the overall effectiveness of this framework by focusing on instrument design (in terms of stringency and predictability) as well as policy coherence. We analyze the development of solar, wind and hydropower, as well as biodiesel and ethanol, in the period between 2003 and 2018. We find strong increases in stringency for biodiesel, solar and wind power, marginal ones for ethanol, and decreasing ones for hydropower. Predictability presents a consistent challenge for policy effectiveness, with the exception of biodiesel. Overall policy coherence improves with fossil fuel subsidy reductions after 2014, although the complex environmental licensing regime as well as ad hoc fiscal interventions and price controls in the fuel markets create tensions for biofuels expansion. The policy framework as it has evolved through the period under consideration is neither likely to slow down/reverse the growth trend in natural gas consumption for power generation, nor to significantly alter the fuel mix in light-vehicle transportation. Considering that improvements in the policy framework are partially driven by non-climate rationales, we conclude that rising energy-related GHG emissions will increasingly challenge Brazil's contribution to international temperature targets while diminishing its stature in global climate diplomacy. Key policy insights Renewable energy policies in Brazil suffer from a lack of predictability. While recent reductions in fossil fuel subsidies have improved policy coherence, significant incoherencies between policy instruments impede renewable energy expansion. Increasingly ambitious expansion targets for solar and wind power will need to close the supply gap resulting from the relative decline of hydropower in order to avoid further increases in natural gas consumption. Although the Bolsonaro administration has not created substantial policy changes so far, it introduces additional uncertainties regarding long-term decarbonization, while also diminishing Brazil's diplomatic stature in international negotiations. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: SPL (SQUAMOSA-promoter binding protein-like) proteins form a large family of plant-specific transcription factors that play essential roles in various aspects of plant growth and development. They are potentially important candidates for genetic improvement of agronomic traits. However, there were limited information about the SPL genes in Jatropha curcas, an important biofuel plant. Results: In Jatropha, 15 JcSPL genes were identified. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that most of the JcSPLs were closely related to SPLs from woody plant rather than herbaceous plant and distantly related to monocotyledon SPLs. Gene structure, conserved motif and repetitive sequence analysis indicated diverse and specific functions of some JcSPL genes. By combination of target prediction and degradome sequencing analysis, 10 of the 15 JcSPLs were shown to be targets of JcmiR156. Quantitative PCR analysis showed diversified spatial-temporal expression patterns of JcSPLs. It is interesting that the expression levels of JcSPL3 were the highest in all tissues examined in 7- or 10-year-old plants and exhibited increasing trend with plant age, suggesting its important role in the regulation of age development in Jatropha. Overexpression of JcSPL3 in Arabidopsis resulted in earlier flowering time, shorter silique length and reduced biomass of roots. Conclusions: Through comprehensive and systematic analysis of phylogenetic relationships, conserved motifs, gene structures, chromosomal locations, repetitive sequence and expression patterns, 15 JcSPL genes were identified in Jatropha and characterized in great detail. These results provide deep insight into the evolutionary origin and biological significance of plant SPLs and lay the foundation for further functional characterization of JcSPLs with the purpose of genetic improvement in Jatropha. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - The paper describes transesterification of oil by methanol with use of cosolvents such as ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran, hexane, acetone and diethyl ether at catalyst homogeneous (potassium hydroxide) and heterogeneous (mixed oxides). The cosolvents dissolve oil and methanol to form a single (homogeneous) phase, which increases the reaction rate. Therefore, the biodiesel production will be environmentally friendly because less energy is consumed, which increases sustainability. The whole binodal curve of ternary plots of oil, methanol and cosolvent was determined to find the molar ratio, in which the reaction mixture forms a single phase. The ethyl acetate and tetrahydrofuran have relatively small heterogeneous region, because of the similarity of their electric dipole moment with methanol. After transesterification, the detailed analysis of ester and also glycerol phase was carried out. For homogeneous catalyst, the highest esters content in the ester phase was achieved with tetrahydrofuran. For heterogeneous catalyst, the ester content was lower with cosolvent than without cosolvent, probably due to dilution of reaction components by cosolvent or bonding of cosolvent to the active sites of the catalyst. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Dual-fuel combustion using diesel and high-octane number (ON) biofuel of n-butanol blends to ignite compressed natural gas (CNG) with pilot fuel split injection was investigated. 30% n-butanol/70% diesel (B30D70) and pure diesel (B0D100) as the pilot fuels were compared with the start of pre-injection (SOIp) timings swept from −30 (SOIp30) to −80 °CA ATDC (SOIp80) under the CNG substitution rates of 50% at low load and 65% at medium load. A fixed start of main-injection (SOIm) timing of −9 °CA ATDC in B0D100 and various SOIm timings in B30D70 to match CA50 of B0D100 were employed. The experimental results indicated that adding n-butanol in the pilot fuel can significantly reduce the PM emission at advanced SOIp timings even with large proportion of pilot fuel. At low load, B30D70 reveals higher indicated thermal efficiency (ITE) due to its shorter combustion duration compared to B0D100, and it also leads to lower NOx emissions resulted from the more homogeneous mixture. The CO and THC emissions tend to be slightly increased in B30D70 for the advanced SOIp timings. At medium load, B30D70 also obtains higher ITE but yields higher NOx emissions. Relatively low level of NOx emissions can be obtained at early SOIp timings, such as SOIp60, SOIp70 and SOIp80. The CO and THC emissions are similar for the two pilot fuels at these timings. For the comparisons of the two pilot fuels and injection strategies, it can be demonstrated that B30D70 is more favorable to the thermal efficiency and emissions with split injection at SOIp40 under low load condition and early SOIp timings under medium load condition. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A petroleum refinery heavily depends on crude oil as its main feedstock to produce liquid fuels and chemicals. In the long term, this unyielding dependency is threatened by the depletion of the crude oil reserve. However, in the short term, its price highly fluctuates due to various factors, such as regional and global security instability causing additional complexity on refinery production planning. The petroleum refining industries are also drawing criticism and pressure due to their direct and indirect impacts on the environment. The exhaust gas emission of automobiles apart from the industrial and power plant emission has been viewed as the cause of global warming. In this sense, there is a need for a feasible, sustainable, and environmentally friendly generation process of fuels and chemicals. The attention turns to the utilization of biomass as a potential feedstock to produce substitutes for petroleum-derived fuels and building blocks for biochemicals. Biomass is abundant and currently is still low in utilization. The biorefinery, a facility to convert biomass into biofuels and biochemicals, is still lacking in competitiveness to a petroleum refinery. An attractive solution that addresses both is by the integration of bio- and petroleum refineries. In this context, the right decision making in the process selection and technologies can lower the investment and operational costs and assure optimum yield. Process optimization based on mathematical programming has been extensively used to conduct techno-economic and sustainability analysis for bio-, petroleum, and the integration of both refineries. This paper provides insights into the context of crude oil and biomass as potential refinery feedstocks. The current optimization status of either bio- or petroleum refineries and their integration is reviewed with the focus on the methods to solve the multi-objective optimization problems. Internal and external uncertain parameters are important aspects in process optimization. The nature of these uncertain parameters and their representation methods in process optimization are also discussed. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Jojoba is one of the main two known plant source of natural liquid wax ester for use in various applications, including cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and biofuel. Due to the lack of transcriptomic and genomic data on lipid biosynthesis and accumulation, molecular marker breeding has been used to improve jojoba oil production and quality. In the current study, the transcriptome of developing jojoba seeds was investigated using the Illunina NovaSeq 6000 system, 100 × 106 paired end reads, an average length of 100 bp, and a sequence depth of 12 Gb per sample. A total of 176,106 unigenes were detected with an average contig length of 201 bp. Gene Ontology (GO) showed that the detected unigenes were distributed in the three GO groups biological processes (BP, 5.53%), cellular component (CC, 6.06%), and molecular functions (MF, 5.88%) and distributed in 67 functional groups. The lipid biosynthesis pathway was established based on the expression of lipid biosynthesis genes, fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis, FA desaturation, FA elongation, fatty alcohol biosynthesis, triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis, phospholipid metabolism, wax ester biosynthesis, and lipid transfer and storage genes. The detection of these categories of genes confirms the presence of an efficient lipid biosynthesis and accumulation system in developing jojoba seeds. The results of this study will significantly enhance the current understanding of wax ester biology in jojoba seeds and open new routes for the improvement of jojoba oil production and quality through biotechnology applications. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The production of oil from microalgae is a process with a long way to go before reaching commercial viability. High costs associated with harvesting and solvent extraction make it difficult to compete with fossil fuel. The in-situ, non-destructive, repetitive extraction of lipids from Botryococcus braunii (milking) offers an alternative to the conventional microalgal-oil production process, with significantly reduced nutrient, dewatering and cultivation costs. Here, we compare low shear column solvent extraction with high shear stirred tank solvent extraction to ascertain which is better suited to a repetitive extraction process using B. braunii and carry out a preliminary economic analysis on the nutrient costs and raceway pond area requirements once scaled to industrial production. Stirred tank extraction with heptane resulted in five times higher productivities than that of column solvent extraction. Using this to generate an extraction model we found a lipid productivity of 104 mg L-1 day-1 was possible, six times greater than that of previous repetitive extraction studies. Thanks to the high lipid content of the B. braunii biomass generated in the recovery phase, when scaled to open raceway ponds, a lipid productivity of 13.4 g m-2 day-1 can be predicted. With this productivity, an estimated combined carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cost of $2.52 L-1 of oil produced and a cultivation pond area of 3.53 km2 (assuming an annual oil production of 15,900 m3 year-1) is predicted, corresponding to reductions when compared to conventional extraction of 40% and 50% respectively. This repetitive extraction process provides an alternative method for the production of 3rd generation biofuels without the need to harvest and dewater algal biomass with significant reductions in nutrient and pond area requirements. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the current work, Lean Pre-vaporized Premixed (LPP) combustion concept was used to investigate the flame characteristics of blended fuels using 5, 10, 15, and 20% blending ratios of Waste Cooking Oil Methyl Ester (WCOME) with Jet A-1 (symbolized as B5, B10, B15, and B20). Here, WCOME was produced from raw waste cooking oil by transesterification process with the help of ultrasonicator to reduce the production time. The flame was stabilized using a swirl burner characterized by the formation of central recirculation zone with Swirl Number (SN) equal 0.55; commonly called High Swirl Burner (HSB). The incoming air was preheated to a constant temperature of 250 °C and mixed with air at equivalence ratio φ of 0.75 for all tested fuel blends. Comparing to neat Jet A-1 fuel flame, flames of WCOME/Jet A-1 fuel blend revealed great effect of adding biodiesel to Jet A-1 on local and global emission characteristics of LPP combustion with comparable temperature distributions. Results showed a significant reduction in CO and NOx emissions indices for B20 at combustor exit by 41% and 30%, respectively, compared to those for pure Jet A-1 fuel. Aiming to increase the share of biofuel in fuel combustion, it can be concluded that, Jet A-1 fuel can be replaced by B20 without any modifications in the combustor design as they have similar temperature distribution with potential to remarkably reduce emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The experimentally obtained biodiesel from used vegetable oil is used as an alternative energy source that has been synthesized from reactions directed by a solid acid catalyst. The solid acid catalyst was prepared by sulfonating rubber from rubber for used tires. For the realization and analysis of biodiesel tests in the internal combustion engine, an experimental design was applied in which the type of biofuel feed was used as the main control, namely pure commercial diesel (DIEP), a mixture of 50/50% biodiesel-diesel (MEBD) and pure biodiesel (BIOP). The performance values and the emission and combustion characteristics of the fuel feed were investigated and compared under the same experimental conditions. During gas combustion, a considerable reduction of CO, unburned hydrocarbon and NOx emissions was achieved by using BIOP obtained in the laboratory compared to DIEP. © 2020, Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana Iztapalapa.

AB  - Thermal degradation plays a very important role in the understanding of pyrolysis and oxidation. Parameters of ignition, flammability and flame propagation depend on it. In this context, the aim of this study is to study experimentally thermal degradation of two terpene-derived biofuels: α-pinene and β-pinene. Thermogravimetric analyses are performed for four heating rates (3, 5, 10, 20 K/min) under two atmospheres: air and nitrogen. Kinetic parameters are extracted using three different methods. Activation energies for these two biodiesels are given for the first time. In addition, GC–MS analyses are performed to study gaseous emissions of these two compounds. Results show that α-pinene is slightly more reactive than β-pinene. Comparisons with literature show that activation energies of these two biofuels are close to diesel and sunflower biofuel ones. Obtained results will be useful for numerical simulations of biodiesel combustion, as an alternative to fossil fuels. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Ethanol is a biofuel used to reduce fossil fuel consumption and the greenhouse gases emissions associated with road transportation. Bioethanol is obtained from diluted fermentation broths, and various technological solutions are available for its recovery and dehydration prior marketing, usually blended with gasoline (gasohol). This work explores an ethanol purification approach where gasoline is used as a separation agent towards the direct production of gasohol. This alternative replaces part of the purification steps in common ethanol downstream processing, providing significant reductions on the operating costs required to produce bioethanol. Two configurations for the direct manufacture of E10 gasohol are analyzed. Process I incorporates a liquid-liquid extraction stage, while Process II uses an extractive distillation arrangement. The energy requirements of both configurations are compared against each other and with a benchmark process where ethanol dehydration is carried out by molecular sieves (Process MS). The results show that both alternatives are energetically advantageous since they can be optimized to reduce their equivalent energy requirements by 33% compared to Process MS, for ethanol concentrations in the fermentation broths between 2 and 10 wt%. Further improvements could be achieved with a multi-effect distillation system in the ethanol concentration step, allowing total energy savings of 68% relatively to the benchmark, for a fermentation broth containing 5 wt% ethanol. Estimated ethanol separation costs are approximately $0.15/kg ·ethanol, making these technological alternatives especially attractive for large scale industrial application. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the present study, tests are conducted on the Kirloskar TV-1 four stroke single cylinder water cooled diesel engine. In the first phase of investigation, study optimized the 230 bar as a best injector opening pressure, 26° bTDC as a best injection timing, 18 as best a compression ratio, 5 holes nozzle as a best nozzle and re-entrant toroidal piston bowl geometry as a best piston bowl geometry when the engine is operated single fuel (B20). In the second phase of investigation, study optimized the 0.48 kg/h Bio-CNG flow rate as a best flow rate, 29° bTDC as a best injection timing, CR 18 as a best compression ratio and Venturi-type carburetor as the best carburetor when the engine is operated with dual fuel (B20+Bio-CNG). In the third phase of investigation, existing baseline diesel engine is modified with all above optimized engine parameters and test results are compared with baseline engine. The experimental study revealed that modified engine has shown the improved performance, combustion and emission characteristics than the baseline engine when it is operated with dual fuel (B20+Bio-CNG). Thus, dairy scum biodiesel and Bio-CNG can be used as alternative fuels in the CI engines with slight modification. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Presented here is an overview of nonvolatile particulate matter (nvPM) emissions, i.e., "soot", as assessed by TEM analyses of samples collected after the exhaust of a J-85 turbojet fueled with Jet-A as well as with blends of Jet-A and Camelina biofuel. A unifying explanation is provided to illustrate the combustion dynamics of biofuel and Jet-A fuel. The variations of primary particle size, aggregate size, and nanostructure are analyzed as a function of biofuel blend across a range of engine thrust levels. The postulate is based on where fuels start along the soot formation pathway. Increasing biofuel content lowers aromatic concentration while placing increasing dependence upon fuel pyrolysis reactions to form the requisite concentration of aromatics for particle inception and growth. The required "kinetic" time for pyrolysis reactions to produce benzene and multiring PAHs allows increased fuel-air mixing by turbulence, diluting the fuel-rich soot-forming regions, effectively lowering their equivalence ratio. With a lower precursor concentration, particle inception is slowed, the resulting concentration of primary particles is lowered, and smaller aggregates were measured. The lower equivalence ratio also results in smaller primary particles because of the lower concentration of growth species. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - New surfactant-free microemulsion biofuels are synthesized and characterized in this work. Moringa and safflower plants have been used for providing the required oils because of their excellent resistance in dry and harsh environmental conditions. Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), 1-heptanol, 1-octanol, oleic acid, 1,4-dioxane, and dibutyl ether have been used as biofuel additives. The obtained phase behavior results show that the microemulsion region of ternary phase diagrams in these systems decreases as follows: oleic acid > 1-octanol > 1-heptanol > MTBE > dibutyl ether >1,4-dioxane. The nanostructures formed in these types of ternary mixtures are investigated by conductivity, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) techniques. Three different micro regions, including ethanol in oil (E/O), bicontinuous (B.C.), and oil in ethanol (O/E), have been recognized using electrical conductivity experiments along ethanol dilution lines. According to the presented results, the E/O region regarding the studied microemulsions is wider than the B.C. and O/E regions. Thus, the proposed formulation according to the reverse micelle microemulsion formation can be considered as a useful approach for biofuel production. It is also shown that the kinematic viscosities and densities of the formulated biofuels in this article satisfy the approved biofuel standards. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In order to overcome the depletion of energy resources, the production of fuel from a renewable source (green fuel) has aroused attention. The present work serves as a comparative study for green fuel production by utilizing monometallic Ni and bimetallic NiMo loaded on amine-functionalized mesoporous silica (MS). Two types of catalysts, denoted as Ni/NH2-MS and NiMo/NH2-MS, were prepared and evaluated for its catalytic activity in the hydrotreatment of waste coconut oil (WCO) at 450 °C under the flow of H2 gas (20 mL.min-1). Each catalysts were characterized by using X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (AAS), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Fourier Transform Infra Red (FTIR). Study of selectivity by GC-MS showed that gasoline-range hydrocarbon, especially n-undecane, was the major compound in the liquid products generated by the two amine-functionalized catalysts prepared in this study. The result showed that monometallic Ni/NH2-MS with surface area, total pore volume, nickel loading and average pore diameter 328.68 m2.g-1, 0.25 cm3.g-1, 1.90 wt%, 3.10 nm, respectively, exhibited the best performance in producing liquid hydrocarbon and generated higher level of liquid product (77.9 wt%) than bimetallic NiMo/NH2-MS (76.3 wt%). However, it is highlighted that adding 1.08 wt% of Mo in bimetallic NiMo/NH2-MS comprising 0.83 wt% of Ni improved the catalyst selectivity towards producing higher level of gasoline-range hydrocarbon (43 wt%). The bimetallic NiMo/NH2-MS prepared was found to have surface area, total pore volume, and average pore diameter of 325.13 m2.g-1, 0.14 cm3.g-1, 3.22 nm, respectively. Copyright © 2020 BCREC Group.

AB  - The present study investigated honne oil methyl esters (HOME) production from crude honne seed oil (HSO) using a novel catalyst synthesized from a blend of cocoa pod husk and plantain peel. A two-step esterification-transesterification method was used for the HOME production. For the esterification, the crude HSO was pretreated with H2SO4 to reduce its very high acid value to an acceptable level prior to transesterification to biodiesel. Characterization of the calcined cocoa pod husk-plantain peel ash (CCPA) showed that K (50.95%), Mg (2.49%) and Ca (2.30%) were the major metals present, thereby confirming its heterogeneity. Physisorption isotherms obtained for the CCPA indicate it is composed of nanoparticles that are mesoporous in nature. The initial high acid value of the oil (35.5 g KOH/g oil) was reduced to 1.68 ± 0.57 g KOH/g oil via esterification at a temperature of 65 °C, MeOH:HSO molar ratio of 50:1 and H2SO4 of 2 vol% after 2.5 h. The best operating condition that gave maximum HOME yield (98.98 ± 0.04 wt%) was CCPA amount of 4.5 wt%, reaction temperature of 65 °C, time of 2.5 h and MeOH:pretreated HSO molar ratio of 15:1. The HOME produced satisfied standard limits set for biodiesel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Generally, the compression ignition (CI) engine that runs with emulsified biofuel (EB) or higher viscosity fuel experiences inferior performance and a higher emission compared to petro diesel engines. The modification is necessary to standard engine level in order to realize its application. This paper proposes a guide vane design (GVD), which needs to be installed in the intake manifold, is incorporated with shallow depth re-entrance combustion chamber (SCC) pistons. This will organize and develop proper in-cylinder airflow to promote better diffusion, evaporation and combustion processes. The model of GVD and SCC piston was designed using SolidWorks 2017; while ANSYS Fluent version 15 was utilized to run a 3D analysis of the cold flow IC engine. In this research, seven designs of GVD with the number of vanes varied from two to eight vanes (V2-V8) are used. The four-vane model (V4) has shown an excellent turbulent flow as well as swirl, tumble and cross tumble ratios in the fuel-injected region compared to other designs. This is indispensable to break up heavier fuel molecules of EB to mix with the air that will eventually improve engine performance. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The study gives an overview of raw materials and biofuel generation, markets, production, and regulation. The major aim of this study was to reveal the impacts of biofuel production on international commodity trade. According to the results of the country-level regressions, the export of corn and sugar cane have generally negatively impacted ethanol production. This effect was positive at the global level which indicates that some of the imported raw materials are used for ethanol production. Although the explanatory power of the models was relatively high (from 0.35 (EU) to 0.94 (USA), none of models proved to be significant, even at the 10% level. These values were higher for the biodiesel models (from 0.53 (USA) to 0.97 (Brazil) and the EU model results were significant at the 5% level. The export of raw materials had a positive impact on biodiesel production. This implies that some part of the biodiesel was produced from the imported raw materials. The export of processed products (different oils) had a negative impact on biodiesel production, as they are normally used for other purposes. © 2020 by the author.

AB  - Chemical and physical analysis was performed to identify the molten slag composition and its ability to be used as alternative catalyst in pyrolysis of waste cooking oil. The implementation such type of cata-lytic material could be useful in reducing the process cost. To increase the efficiency (increase the ac-tive site) of molten slag, it was modified by acid washing that resulted in an increase in the acidity from 159 to 1224 μmol/g. The results showed that the yield of bio-fuel was increased and the product selective to n-C15 upon the modification of molten slag by acid treatment. Copyright © 2020 BCREC Group.

AB  - Cookstove researchers are paying more attention to the improvement in the combustion performance of a biomass cookstove, which requires an understanding of the effects of different parameters on pollutant emissions. Five such important parameters were identified namely, Inlet area ratio, Primary air ratio, Pot gap, Fuel surface to volume ratio and Pot diameter. The work presented here comprises estimating the effects of these five parameters on the energy and emissions performance of natural draft biomass cookstove. A prototype stove was tested to quantify the effects of these parameters on chosen performance parameters like overall efficiency, CO and PM2.5 emissions per MJ of energy delivered to the pot. The data obtained from a proper sequence of designed experiments were coupled with RSM (Response surface Methodology) technique to fit second-order models for predicting the performance of the stove under different conditions. The RSM models were then used with desirability function for robust parameter optimization of stove and confirmation trials were performed for validating the findings. The CCD (Central composite design) combined with RSM and the desirability function was found to be an effective tool for performance optimization of a natural draft biomass cookstove. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The Nordic countries have ambitious plans to reduce the use of fossil fuels. One possible solution is to blend biofuel into the liquid fuel mix. A large share of this biofuel could potentially be produced from forest biomass, which is an easily available resource in the Nordic countries. However, technologies for producing liquid biofuel from forest-based biomass are immature, implying high risk for biofuel investors. This study assesses six different support schemes that may increase the attractiveness of investing in forest-based liquid biofuel production facilities. Furthermore, the study simulates the likely effects of policy schemes on the future production of forest-based liquid biofuels using a partial equilibrium forest sector model. The study applies an nth plant estimate for the costs of various biofuel technologies and analyses investment support, feed-in premiums, quota obligations, increase in fossil fuel taxes, biofuel tax exemptions, and support for using harvest residues. According to the model results, a feed-in premium gives the lowest needed subsidy cost for production levels below 6 billion L (25% market share) of forest-based biofuel, while quota obligation is the cheapest option for production levels above 6 billion L. The necessary subsidy level is in the range of 0.60–0.85 €/L (82–116% of the fossil fuel cost in 2030) for realistic amounts of biofuel production. The pulpwood prices increase up to 24% from the base scenario due to increasing biomass demand. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - This study aims to explore the feasibility of transforming CO2 into lipids for biodiesel by integrating anaerobic fermentation and black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) bioconversion. The optimal conditions for CO2 and biowaste fermentation into volatile fatty acids (VFAs) were examined under different pH conditions. Moreover, we also explored the effects of different concentrations of VFAs solutions on BSFL lipid accumulation. The results showed that the optimal pH was 7 for the production of VFAs, and the maximum acetate and butyrate concentrations were 10.11 and 3.56 g/L, respectively. Feeding BSFL with this fermentation broth increased their lipid content by 26.30% compared with the control. Moreover, the optimum concentration of VFAs solution was 26 g/L to enhance the lipid content of BSFL. This work provides an innovative route of great potential to reduce the cost and energy consumption to fix CO2 in an anthropogenic carbon cycle: the VFAs from CO2 and organic waste do not need to be extracted from fermentation broth, and can be directly used for lipid accumulation in BSFL for biodiesel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Styrax tonkinensis (Pierre) Craib ex Hartwich has great potential as a woody biodiesel species having seed kernels with high oil content, excellent fatty acid composition and good fuel properties. However, no transcriptome information is available on the molecular regulatory mechanism of oil accumulation in developing S. tonkinensis kernels. Results: The dynamic patterns of oil content and fatty acid composition at 11 time points from 50 to 150 days after flowering (DAF) were analyzed. The percent oil content showed an up-down-up pattern, with yield and degree of unsaturation peaking on or after 140 DAF. Four time points (50, 70, 100, and 130 DAF) were selected for Illumina transcriptome sequencing. Approximately 73 million high quality clean reads were generated, and then assembled into 168,207 unigenes with a mean length of 854 bp. There were 5916 genes that were differentially expressed between different time points. These differentially expressed genes were grouped into 9 clusters based on their expression patterns. Expression patterns of a subset of 12 unigenes were confirmed by qRT-PCR. Based on their functional annotation through the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool and publicly available protein databases, specific unigenes encoding key enzymes, transmembrane transporters, and transcription factors associated with oil accumulation were determined. Three main patterns of expression were evident. Most unigenes peaked at 70 DAF, coincident with a rapid increase in oil content during kernel development. Unigenes with high expression at 50 DAF were associated with plastid formation and earlier stages of oil synthesis, including pyruvate and acetyl-CoA formation. Unigenes associated with triacylglycerol biosynthesis and oil body development peaked at 100 or 130 DAF. Conclusions: Transcriptome changes during oil accumulation show a distinct temporal trend with few abrupt transitions. Expression profiles suggest that acetyl-CoA formation for oil biosynthesis is both directly from pyruvate and indirectly via acetaldehyde, and indicate that the main carbon source for fatty acid biosynthesis is triosephosphate originating from phosphohexose outside the plastid. Different sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferases are implicated in diacylglycerol biosynthesis at early versus late stages of oil accumulation. Triacylglycerol biosynthesis may be accomplished by both diacylglycerol and by phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferases. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Herein, we present the C-14 levulinate ester of 2,3-butanediol as the product of sugar fermentation liquors. The designed Brønsted acidic ionic liquid (BAIL) catalysts enable self-induced phase separation with ester products, and the role of anions has been investigated. Esterification reactions were carried out by 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BDO) and levulinic acid in solvent-free media and low temperatures (60-105 °C). For comparison, sulfuric acid, amberlite IR-120, and sulfonic acid-functionalized pyridinium ionic liquids with different anions were utilized as a catalyst upon esterification reaction. The diester product, namely, butane-2,3-diyl bis(4-oxopentanoate), was formed with a good yield (85%) and selectivity (85%) after complete conversion of 2,3-BDO in 24 h at 80 °C. The low yield (8%) of the monoester was observed. The monoester and diester were separated by a liquid-liquid extraction method. The ester products were characterized by various instrumental techniques such as 1H and 13C NMR, GC-FID, LC-MS, and FT-IR spectroscopy. The Hammett acidity functions of BAILs were determined from UV-vis spectroscopy. The catalyst was successfully recycled and reused in the processes. The spent BAILs were reused in six consecutive cycles with only a ∼7% diminished diester yield and selectivity. The produced levulinate ester will be useful as biofuel additives, solvents, plasticizers, and other applications. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this present work, performance and emission levels have been investigated using renewable and sustainable fuels derived from different agricultural residues. For the same injected pilot fuel, producer gas operation with redgram stalk (RGS) derived fuel provided improved liquid fuel saving. Downdraft gasifier was integrated with 4 stroke direct injection water cooled 5.2 kW CI engine at 1500 rpm and run under dual fuel mode using diesel/honge oil methyl ester (HOME)-producer gas. Experimental investigation showed that the gasifier-engine system with diesel-RGS derived producer gas dual fuel operation results in 13.05% higher brake thermal efficiency. Diesel-producer gas (RGS) operation showed the 16.1% decreased exhaust gas temperature and the 12.1% higher nitric oxide (NOx) emission compared to HOME based dual fuel operation. NOx emissions for the HOME based engine operation were found to be lower than the diesel based operation; however, the smoke, hydrocarbon, and carbon monoxide emissions were higher. Diesel fuel saving about 56% was achieved by diesel-producer gas (RGS) dual fuel operation and 100% biofuel utilization in HOME-producer gas dual fuel operation. Further, cylinder pressure and heat release rates for HOME-producer gas (RGS) were marginally lesser than the diesel based operation. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Smallholders constitute more than three quarters of the world's farmers, and despite their numbers, they commonly lack opportunities to advance their development status. Bioenergy production and consumption can help sustain smallholders' energy needs and generate employment and income, but it also raises concerns over social justice and equity, especially where crops used for bioenergy could also be used for food. This perspective paper is grounded in a literature review related to three different crops in Brazil: sugarcane, landrace maize and sweet potato. It seeks to determine if these crops offer the potential to support smallholder farmers' development in a more equitable way, focusing on opportunities for their use in bioenergy. We review the literature to identify policies shaping the smallholder development context in relation to these crops, assessing whose knowledge informs policy and institutional decision making, and highlighting the policy attention afforded to the different crops from different sectors. We further evaluate the literature on each crop in relation to water use and calorific value (i.e., food and energy). Our review indicates that while sugarcane has received the most policy and institutional attention, its development is largely anchored in research and development investments that support large-scale commercial farms and agri-businesses. Smallholders have not benefited or had the opportunity to engage in relevant policy decision making for sugarcane cultivation. At the same time, smallholders hold valuable untapped knowledge on the cultivation of sweet potato and landrace maize, both of which have the potential to generate development opportunities for smallholders. Our review suggests that the environmental impact of landrace maize and sweet potato in terms of water use is significantly lower than sugarcane, while they can generate more calories for energy or food consumption and offer diversification opportunities. Despite that these alternative crops offer considerable untapped potential to support rural development, more research is still needed to harness these benefits. Changes are needed to address inequities in policies, institutions and the types of knowledge informing decision making. Such changes need to afford smallholder farmers greater recognition and participation in decision making, so that the distribution of benefits from the three study crops can reach them to support their development better. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - An application of hydro-processed renewable diesel (HRD) intended to reduce non-regulated emissions, including formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX), is proposed in this study, in association with the emissions from a turbo-charged common-rail direct-injection diesel engine under steady-state operation. Three types of fuel, pure petro-diesel, 20% HRD blended fuel (H20), and 20% biodiesel blended fuel (B20) were tested under various engine loads and engine speeds. According to the emissions analysis, in which the samples were collected and analyzed through the solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) technique adapted with a derivation method, a 20% addition of HRD reduced the emissions of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, benzene, toluene, and xylene, as compared to D100 and B20. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) can be widely used to reduce the oxynitride (NOx) pollution in Low-Speed Two-Stroke Marine Diesel Engines. In this paper, two EGR systems (HP EGR1 and LP EGR2) were investigated in terms of the influence of different rates on the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and the NOx emissions. As for this simulation, the exhaust gas cleaning water treatment was not concluded. Besides, Miller Cycle was used to determine the influence of its valve timing on BSFC and NOx emissions. The combination of Miller Cycle and HP EGR system decreased the NOx emissions, which could meet the IMO3 Tier III standard, 3.4 g/kWh. Moreover, the influence of the EGR cooling temperature was discussed. Finally, a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model was developed to evaluate the two EGR systems. The results showed that when the HP EGR system and the LP EGR system were all operating at a maximum EGR rate, LP EGR system showed more advantages. © 2019

AB  - Fuel reformulation and the development of alternative fuels are currently topics of great interest. For example, gasoline can be reformulated for a reduction of emitted toxic pollutants. However, fossil and bio fuels are of complex compositions, and reformulation can dramatically affect the physical, chemical and safety properties of the fuel. Tools that can predict these properties are then of particular importance. In this work, we propose a general approach to accurately predict the flash points of complex fuels such as gasoline, jet fuels, diesels, and biofuels. The predictive method is based on a combination of Catoire – Naudet model with a fully predictive activity coefficient model. Excellent predictions of the flash points of mixtures are obtained for a broad variety of systems, when the COSMO-SAC dsp thermodynamic model is used. It can be used to predict the flash points of mixtures of various types of fuels: ex-fossil, first, second and third generation biofuels and their mixtures. The new approach can take into account the addition of molecules to a complex fuel when experimental measurements are not available, whatever the reasons are. The theoretical predictions confirm the experimental observation that a small amount of volatile compound such as ethanol can dramatically reduce the flash point of multicomponent fuels. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, the production of fuel and fuel additives from low-viscosity waste renewable mineral oils, called number-10 oil in Turkey, and also of their mixtures, was investigated in detail. The direct addition of these oils and their blends to diesel cause clogging of the fuel pumps of the vehicles due to the crystallization of the waxes present in them, especially at low temperatures. Because of this congestion in the pump, the fuel cannot be pumped to the injectors properly at a constant pressure; this results in incomplete combustion of the fuel, which causes environmental pollution. This problem was solved by developing a simple, economical and environmentally friendly process. It was achieved by blending these oils or their mixtures with suitable solvents and by setting the total oil/total solvent ratio to be at least 1/3 (w/w). Once these oils were blended with suitable solvents or their mixtures, and when the total oil/total solvent ratio was adjusted to be at an optimum, it was noticed that there was no wax crystallization even at very low temperatures down to −35 °C. If these mixtures are prepared using these guidelines, they can be used as fuel or fuel additives in diesel- or gasoline-consuming vehicles without causing air pollution and without reducing the performance of the vehicles, while providing fuel savings up to 15%. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The progress of algal-based biofuel industry depends on the identification of high lipid-yielding algal species from diverse environments. Laboratory-scale standardization of culture requirements for optimum yield of lipids and other desirable chemicals are highly important in the industrial utilization of an algal species. The major objectives of the present study were such an evaluation of the industrial potentials of a fast-growing native green microalga isolated from eutrophicated water bodies of Kerala, South India, morphologically and molecularly identified as Chloroidium saccharophilum. Biomass productivity and biochemical composition of the alga in relation to culture parameters such as total carbohydrates, proteins, pigments and lipids were learned. At an increased pH (8) or salinity (50 mM) and at a deprived nitrate (0 mM) or decreased phosphate (0.5 mM) in the medium, the alga was found producing lipids that have good biodiesel properties such as low iodine value and high cetane number. Optimum culture parameters such as pH, salinity, nitrate and phosphate conditions for maximum biomass yield of the alga are discovered. It was found that an increase in salinity or phosphates and a decrease in nitrate from that of the normal Bold's Basal Medium are favourable for an increase in omega-3 fatty acid content in the lipid. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Preparation of methyl palmitate, isopropyl palmitate, isobutyl palmitate, and isoamyl palmitate was carried out using pyridine n-butyl bisulfate ionic liquid as catalyst in a self-designed reactor to catalyze esterification reaction of palmitic acid with methanol, isopropanol, isobutanol, and isoamyl alcohol, respectively. According to the single-factor experimental results, an orthogonal test of four factors and three levels was carried out for branched-chain alkyl esters of palmitic acid under different reaction time, reaction temperature, and catalyst dosage. Verification test was conducted under the optimal conditions, and the conversion in all the cases was up to 97%. Analysis of the reaction kinetics of methyl palmitate, isopropyl palmitate, isobutyl palmitate, and isoamyl palmitate was carried out by the integral method. Reaction order, frequency factor, activation energy, and reaction kinetic model were determined. Compared to methyl palmitate, the kinematic viscosity of the branched-chain alkyl esters of palmitic acid was slightly higher; however, the solidifying point (SP) and cold filter plugging point (CFPP) decreased with increasing degree of branched-chain. The CFPP reduced by up to 15 °C. Therefore, the use of branched-chain alcohol instead of methanol ester exchange descaling method can effectively reduce the SP and CFPP of biodiesel to improve its cold flow properties. © 2019

AB  - Abstract: Microalgae could serve as an ideal bioenergy resource for third-generation biofuels because of its endless features. However, in an effort to render it as a commercially viable bioenergy resource, certain improvements that enhance its productivity are required. In the present study, the role of three independent substrates, tryptophan, sodium thiosulfate, and sodium pyruvate, and their incorporation in modified BG-11 towards maximizing the Chlorella vulgaris FACHB-8 productivity was studied. These substrates could strongly impart a stimulating effect on microalgal productivity, firstly, either by promoting faster growth and chlorophyll content (tryptophan), or secondly by quenching the reactive oxygen species out of the culture medium (pyruvate), or thirdly by reducing the culture medium (thiosulfate). Response surface mediated optimal design model was effective in calculating the optimal concentration of these three independent substrates in modified BG-11. The observed actual values (1.54 g L−1—biomass and 1.91 µg L−1—chlorophyll) of the model were in close agreement with the predicted values (1.4 g L−1—biomass and 1.82 µg L−1—chlorophyll), thus, indicating the validity to the model. Tryptophan (2.2 times-chlorophyll and 2.5 times-biomass) was most effective in stimulating microalgal growth as compared with other substrates in modified BG-11. This study supported the concept that tryptophan after following one of the three pathways acted as the precursor for the production of indole acetic acid that in turn acted as a phytostimulator for microalgal growth. The outcomes of the present study would offer a step towards resolving the gaps present in producing viable, sustainable, high chlorophyll producing microalgal biomass.

AB  - This study reports the results of a detailed analysis of 203 samples of bioliquid used as a substitute for heavy fuel oil in oil-fired power plants. Bioliquid is a mixture of various vegetable oils, animal fats and its byproducts. The heating value of bioliquid is approximately the same as that of heavy fuel oil; however, bioliquid has significantly less N and S components and exhibits better combustion reactivity. For a commercial electricity generation, demonstration tests firing bioliquid in 75, 90, and 100 MW oil-fired boilers were conducted, and the results were compared with those obtained by firing heavy fuel oil. Further, the impacts of bioliquid fuel characteristics on combustion and boiler operation were also investigated. During the bioliquid firing, the heat absorption in the furnace decreased and the furnace exit gas temperature increased in comparison to the heavy fuel oil firing. No serious problems occurred in the boiler operation, and NOx and SOx emissions remarkably decreased. With minor modifications on the fuel transfer system and atomization devices, bioliquid could successfully replace heavy fuel oil in the existing oil-fired boilers. The limited values for 18 fuel properties of bioliquid are suggested by considering the stable boiler operation and environmental safety. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel has many advantages, yet its high price has become the main obstacle to market acceptance. Selecting non-edible woody oil plant resources and optimizing the oil extraction process will contribute to the effective utilization of raw materials and development of the related biodiesel industry. This study presents a detailed evaluation of two Sapindus species (Sapindus delavayi (Franch.) Radlk. and Sapindus mukorossi Gaertn.) as promising feedstocks for biodiesel production. As ultrasonic-assisted extraction (UAE) is considered a green and efficient oil extraction method, the process was optimized by response surface methodology (RSM) using a Box-Behnken design (BBD) in our study. The kernel oil yield of S. delavayi was up to 43.67%-0.16% under the optimized extraction conditions (the ultrasonic power was 109W, extracting at 65 °C for 25 min, and the liquid-solid ratio was 9 mL•g-1). The kernel oil yield of S. mukorossi was as high as 45.96%-0.21% under the optimized extraction conditions (the ultrasonic power was 114W, extracting at 68 °C for 26 min, and the liquid-solid ratio was 9 mL•g-1). The fatty acid profiles of S. delavayi and S. mukorossi kernel oils showed a high percentage of monounsaturated fatty acids (74.91% and 76.32%, respectively) and a low percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids (11.11% and 7.83%, respectively) and saturated fatty acids (13.98% and 15.85%, respectively). Most of the properties of the two biodiesels conformed to EN 14214:2014, ASTM D6751-2018 and GB 25199-2017 standards, except for oxidation stability. In general, the results provided the optimized extraction method using ultrasound for the two species oil extraction and proved that the two kernel oils are potentially useful feedstocks for high-quality and low-cost biodiesel production. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Ketonization is a promising way for upgrading bio-derived carboxylic acids from pyrolysis bio-oils, waste oils, and fats to produce high value-added chemicals and biofuels. Therefore, an understanding of its mechanism can help to carry out the catalytic pyrolysis of biomass more efficiently. Here we show that temperature-programmed desorption mass spectrometry (TPD-MS) together with linear free energy relationships (LFERs) can be used to identify catalytic pyrolysis mechanisms. We report the kinetics of the catalytic pyrolysis of deuterated acetic acid and a reaction series of linear and branched fatty acids into symmetric ketones on the surfaces of ceria-based oxides. A structure–reactivity correlation between Taft’s steric substituent constants Es* and activation energies of ketonization indicates that this reaction is the sterically controlled reaction. Surface D3-n-acetates transform into deuterated acetone isotopomers with different yield, rate, E≠, and deuterium kinetic isotope effect (DKIE). The obtained values of inverse DKIE together with the structure–reactivity correlation support a concerted mechanism over ceria-based catalysts. These results demonstrate that analysis of Taft’s correlations and using simple equation for estimation of DKIE from TPD-MS data are promising approaches for the study of catalytic pyrolysis mechanisms on a semi-quantitative level. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - A fungal species was isolated from 100% soybean methyl ester (B100 SME) and identified as Aureobasidium pullulans. The yeast was evaluated for its ability to grow in and to biodegrade B100 SME, B0 ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD), and B20 ULSD (80% v/v ULSD + 20% B100 SME) in microcosms containing fuel over Bushnell-Haas mineral salts medium. The presence of SME affected the fungal cell morphology and metabolism. After 25 days, fungal biomass at the fuel/water interface in microcosms containing B100 SME and B20 ULSD were 0.98 ± 0.18 mg mL−1 and 0.16 ± 0.05 mg mL−1, respectively.

AB  - Products from waste streams can reduce the amount of materials going to landfills or being incinerated. Brown grease captured from grease traps or wastewater facilities is produced at approximately 1,500,000 metric tons annually in the United States. Two brown grease samples were characterized from a local collector. Raw brown grease was fermented using Clostridium butyricum to produce butyric acid, achieving a yield of 0.55 butyric acid/g sugars indicating that glycerol and lactic acid were also converted. Hexane extraction of the fermentation broth gave an 81.3% recovery of lipids. Techno-economic analysis calculated a minimum fuel selling price of $1.81 per gallon gasoline equivalent (GGE) for a facility based on a city the size of Denver and a brown grease delivery price of $100 per dry metric ton. Exploiting waste streams as feedstocks can significantly reduce costs to produce fuels and can be brought to scale more rapidly due to their ready availability. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Citrus wax is a waste generated during the purification process of the citrus essential oil. A lot of citrus wax wastes are globally produced, despite this, its composition and properties are not well known. Here we present comprehensive results proving the chemical composition and the physical properties of citrus wax. Additionally, our study provides the basis for obtaining value-added products from citrus wax wastes. The qualitative/quantitative analysis revealed the presence of different compounds, which range from flavonoids, saponins, carbohydrates, unsaturated compounds, phenolic hydroxyls, and long-chain fatty acid esters. Given that citrus wax is a source of many bioactive compounds, they were preferably extracted with ethanol. The ethanolic extracts demonstrated the presence in citrus wax of different bioactives, such as 5–5′-dehydrodiferulic acid, 3,7-dimethylquercetin, 5,6-dihydroxy-7,8,3′,4′-tetramethoxyflavone, tangeretin, and limonene. After the extraction of bioactives from citrus wax, a washed waxy material with high content of long-chain fatty acid esters was obtained. It was shown that this washed wax can be used for the production of biodiesel. The transesterification reactions in acid media was the preferred process because higher content of fatty acid methyl esters (such as hexadecanoic acid methyl ester and 9,12-octadecadienoic acid (Z,Z)-, methyl ester) were obtained. Currently, citrus wax does not have any industrial application, here we shown that under the concept of waste biorefinery, the citrus wax wastes are useful sources for producing value-added products such as bioactive compounds and biodiesel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Oil-laden biofuel intermediate (BI) from flash-hydrolyzed microalgae was characterized, pyrolyzed, and subjected to catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) to produce both gaseous and liquid hydrocarbon fuels. The BI was characterized by TGA and FTIR that revealed significant triglyceride, evidenced by C[dbnd]O bond with insignificant level of carbohydrates and proteins. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicated that the BI could be thermally decomposed at 400 °C. Pyrolysis of the BI engendered mainly gaseous hydrocarbon (alkenes) with high heating value (HHV) of 48.5 kJ/mol at 850 °C. Energy of activation for the pyrolytic process was estimated to be 115–300 kJ/mol. Optimization of oil extraction from the BI was performed via design of experiment. The oil was subjected to CTH over NiOx-CoOx-MoOx-zeolite using 2-propanol as hydrogen donor in a 30-ml batch reactor at a temperature range of 390–420 °C and autogenic pressure of 24–27 bar, leading to fatty acid conversion of 99–100%. The main liquid products obtained from the CTH were iso-alkanes (41%), cyclo-alkanes (35%), aromatics (5%), n-alkanes (14%), and alkenes (5%). Kinetics of the CTH showed first order with activation energy of 176 kJ/mol. The catalyst was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Brunaeur-Emmett-Teller (BET) adsorption and desorption, scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and TGA. The catalyst revealed cubic structure, which was maintained after 5 h of CTH reaction. Present in both the fresh and the used catalysts were oxides of alkali and transition metals. The active sites of the catalyst were dominated by Co3+, Ni2+, and Mo6+. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The focus of this work is physico-chemical study of model mixtures containing butanol – a component of perspective biofuel. New detailed data on liquid-liquid equilibria (LLE), solubility and critical compositions were obtained at 293.15 K and atmospheric pressure for quaternary propionic acid – n-butanol – n-butyl propionate – water system. Research methods: gas chromatography, “cloud-point technique”. A brief review of the available data on the mutual solubility and LLE in this system is presented. The regularities of phase diagrams evolution with temperature changes are discussed. The compositions of critical phases were determined at 293.15 and 303.15 K. These data gave opportunity for the construction of polythermal critical surface in a 3D composition space. Correlation of LLE results with the use of NRTL indicates sufficient agreement with the calculated data. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The high acid value of pyrolysis oil obtained from biologic oil is the main drawback that not only affects the properties of pyrolysis oil, but also leads to the corrosion of equipment. Herein, pyrolysis oil obtained from rubber seed oil was upgraded via esterification using ZrO2/SBA-15 as a solid acid catalyst. Using ZrO2/SBA-15 as a catalyst, the acid value of the esterified pyrolysis oil obtained from rubber seed oil was only 1.2 mg KOH•g−1. The density and kinematic viscosity both reached the standard range of 0# diesel oil. The excellent catalytic activity of ZrO2/SBA-15 was studied using NH3-TPD and Py-IR. Furthermore, the conversion reached 96.7% when the ZrO2/SBA-15 catalyst was re-used three times, which shows the ZrO2/SBA-15 catalyst possessed excellent catalytic activity and stability for upgrading pyrolysis oil via esterification. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Electrochemical valorization of non-food biomass-derived carboxylates into fuels is promising for the conversion, storage, and distribution of renewable electricity. Herein, we demonstrate that biofuels, hydrogen, and bicarbonate can be simultaneously produced in an electrochemical cell by one-step electrolysis of free fatty acids under ambient conditions on 3D self-supported ultralow Pt loading (2 wt %) electrode. The three valuable products can naturally separate from each other during the electrolysis in the alkaline aqueous solution. The experimental suggests that Pt(100) and Pt(110) are favorable for the production of non-Kolbe and Kolbe hydrocarbons, respectively. DFT calculation further clarifies the adsorption and stabilization of the reaction intermediates on Pt(100) and Pt(110). © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Dr.Darwin, who was an algae scientist from Germany, Discovered the spiral-shaped algae presence and designated it Spirulina. Spirulina, a seaweed which is a blue-green algae biomass, belongs to the class of cyanobacteria discovered by non-referenced Mexicans in the 16th century and has been used as a daily food source. The first large-scale spirulina plant was created in 1970 and is now being grown in many areas of the globe. Many species of spirulina have been identified in recent decades, but among them are spirulina platensis and spirulina maxima. It is enriched with lots of vitamins, nutrients, antioxidants, proteins, pigments, minerals, …etc…, and is considered a wonder of nature. It is a powerful dietary supplement wealthy in nutrients and vitamins used by National Aeronautics and Space Administration and European Space Agency as a food supplement during space missions and capable of fighting against multiple microbial illnesses by enhancing immunity. Spirulina exhibits anticancer, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and many other activities and also found useful in the production of feedstocks. © 2020 International Journal of Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences.

Keeping the environmental and health concerns into consideration, we employed lipases derived from probiotic sources like L. plantarum and L. brevis for biodiesel production from the gold standard fresh and used olive oil. These lipases have been used to optimize various parameters such as molar ratio of methanol to oil, enzyme loading, reaction temperature, and stirring rate that determine the biodiesel yield. The lipases have been explored in their native and immobilized forms in order to obtain maximum biodiesel conversion. Among the two sources of enzymes, lipase derived from L. plantarum is found to be more efficient in biodiesel production. With the optimal reaction conditions, the maximum biodiesel production using immobilized lipase from L. plantarum with fresh and used olive oil is found to be 81% and 67%, respectively. The biodiesel thus obtained has also been studied for its suitability to be used as a fuel in diesel engine that could meet the viscosity and density limits set by ASTM D 6751. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Butanol is a key microbial product that provides a route from renewable carbohydrate resources to a "drop-in" liquid biofuel, broadening its market in the near future. The acceptable performance of butanol as a neat or a blended fuel in different engines both from the technical and environmental points of view has attracted a wide range of research for reviving the old acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation. In this review, recent findings on fuel characteristics of butanol, different generations of substrate for large scale butanol production, and alternative process designs for upstream, mainstream, and downstream operations have been critically reviewed and discussed. In the upstream, studies devoted to designing and optimization of pretreatments based on prerequisites of butanol production, e.g., maximizing cellulose and hemicellulose recovery and minimizing lignin degradation, are presented. In the mainstream, different microbial systems and process integrations developed for facilitating ABE production (e.g., in-situ butanol removal) are scrutinized. Finally, innovations in ABE recovery and purification as "Achilles Heel" of butanol production processes which directly controls the energy return on investment (EROI), are reviewed and discussed © 2020, Biofuel Research Journal.

AB  - Indonesia has implemented a policy of using diesel fuel containing 20 percent biofuel (commonly known as B20 biodiesel), as stated in Energy and Mineral Resources Ministerial Decree No. 23/2013. This study investigated the flame-spread characteristics of biodiesel (B20) in a microgravity environment through drop tower facilities. This is due to the difficulty in creating droplet sizes similar to the real liquid sprays in the combustion chamber of diesel engines. The experiment used biodiesel (B20) droplets with a diameter 1 mm. The results show that the biodiesel (B20) droplets have characteristics of a flame–spread limit distance SBC/dC0limit = 7. This paper discusses the characteristics of biodiesel (B20) droplets in detail. © 2020 The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers.

AB  - The present study experimentally considers the performance and emissions of three new species of second-generation biofuels (lilium ledebourii, iris meda and the viola odorata seed methyl ester) in a diesel engine. These three biofuels can grow in harsh condition and require low cost of maintenance. All biodiesels are added to diesel fuel by the volume of 20% (B20), 50% (B50), 80% (B80), and 100% (B100). The torque of B20 for all biodiesel samples is much closer to the diesel fuels and the highest torque is achieved by iris meda biodiesel compared to others. The B100 is shown to have the lowest engine power in all biodiesel blends. Also, the viola odorata biodiesel has lower engine power compared to other biodiesel samples. The B20 has the lowest brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) in all biodiesel blends. The viola odorata biodiesel shows a higher BSFC compared to other biodiesels. In addition, the highest reduction of biodiesel is shown by B20, while it is still higher than neat biodiesels. At B100, the highest exhaust gas temperature is displayed during the use of viola odorata biodiesel compared to other biodiesel samples. The viola odorata biodiesel emits NOx of around 29.5% compared to diesel fuels, which is higher than other biodiesels. The increase of biodiesels in diesel fuel decreases the amount of SO2 expressively. The reduction of smoke opacity (B100) for the iris meda, lilium ledebourii, and viola odorata seed biodiesels is about 69%, 72%, and 74%, respectively. The neat viola odorata biodiesel is shown to have the lowest smoke opacity. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The development of biofuels from oleaginous biomass has attracted a great deal of interest not only because of the environment pollution but also because of the rapid depletion of the fossil fuel reserves. Among the biomass conversion processes, the solvolysis reaction has shown to be an interesting solution which allows the direct conversion of raw materials into biofuel. In the present work, a solvolysis process is applied on Pistacia lentiscus (PL) seeds using ethanol as solvent for bio-oil production. Several temperatures varying from 270 to 330 °C, reaction time in the range 15–45 min and ethanol:PL seed ratio values from 0.5–1.5 ml/g were considered. The response surface methodology (RSM) combined with Box-Behnken design (BBD) is used for modeling and optimizing both the process yield and bio-oil viscosity. The results show that the optimum conditions are obtained for a reaction temperature of 304.91 °C, a reaction time of 35.24 min, and an ethanol:PL seed ratio of 1.16. Under these conditions, the predicted PL bio-oil yield is around 63.5% with a bio-oil viscosity of 5.88 mm2/s. The PL bio-oil physicochemical properties showed a good agreement with those of diesel fuel and in conformity with the international requirements except for the viscosity, whose value was found to be slightly higher than the standard. The engine tests show that the fuel specific consumption increases around 9% with a mixture containing bio-oil up to 30%. On the other hand, slight increases in CO (13%), HC (25%) and particulate (30%) emissions were recorded. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Catalytic application of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) for the production of high-value chemicals from the lignocellulosic biomass is investigated for the first time. In particular, the synthesis of 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF), and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) from biomass-derived resources in the presence of inexpensive and readily available MoS2 catalyst via microwave-assisted heating has been studied. The experiments were performed at 100 to 160 °C temperature for 2 to 30 min reaction time in a microwave reactor. Accordingly, the experimental conditions such as reaction temperature, reaction time, catalyst concentration, and feed concentration were optimized for the maximum yield of EMF from the fructose. As a result, maximum 93.3 mol% EMF yield was measured at 160 °C reaction temperature in 30 min when experiments were performed in the presence of 0.3 mmol MoS2 for fructose conversion. It was also observed that the molybdenum disulfide selectively produces EMF in a higher amount with negligible byproducts under optimum operating conditions. Post this, a range of alcohols such as methanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol, and 1-pentanol were tested for the production of different alkoxymethylfurfurals, which showed more than 95% fructose conversion in all cases. Similarly, a wide range of substrates such as glucose, galactose, mannose, and cellulose were tested, which resulted in significant production of EMF. Notably, the EMFs obtained from the experiments can be used as a precursor to producing a vast range of chemicals like polymers, fragrance, plasticizer, resins, fuel additives, and fuel. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Coffee is a global and popular drink with refreshing properties that is consumed in huge amounts daily. During the brewing process, a valuable dark brown organic waste known as spent coffee grounds (SCG) is generated in bulk. SCG has been classified as a promising raw material for the production of various biofuels and added-value products through biorefineries. This paper aims to valorize SCG into biofuel. Firstly, the oil extracted from SCG (SCGO) has been processed into biodiesel fuel. The oil content of SCG has been found to be ~ 12% (by mass). However, SCGO has an extremely high acid value of ~ 24 mg KOH/g oil. Therefore, biodiesel production was conducted through two steps of acid-catalyzed process followed by alkaline-catalyzed transesterification processes along with methanol and heating at 60 °C. It has been found that the properties of spent coffee grounds oil methyl ester (SCGOME) fulfilled ASTM D 6751 biodiesel standards with cetane number of 54.23, kinematic viscosity of 3.73 mm2/s (at 40 °C), flash point of 137.5 °C, density of 891.9 kg/m3 (at 15 °C), oxidation stability of 5.53 h and higher heating value of 39.37 MJ/kg. This is attributed to its excellent degree of unsaturation of 141.54 and long-chain saturated factor of 6.94. Secondly, the qualities of SCGOME and its binary and ternary blends with Euro diesel and three long-chain alcohols of butanol, pentanol, and octanol were considered in this work. This strategy has resulted in a remarkable improvement in both density and cold flow properties and found very close to Euro diesel. Finally, fast, cheap, and reliable characteristics of DSC, FT-IR, TGA, and NMR were examined for the first time in this work to assess the quality of all blends. Such characteristics proved their quality and reliability. In conclusion, this study supports the ongoing research in valorizing SCG to biodiesel through integrated biorefineries towards sustainable circular bioeconomy. It is recommended to conduct detailed engine, emissions, and combustion tests of the blends in the future studies.

AB  - Bulk fuel was produced from spent coffee grounds (SCG) using different oil extraction and fuel production methods. The highest oil yield (30.2%) and energy efficiency (50%) from continuous hydrothermal liquefaction (CHTL) of the SCG, in water as a solvent, also had the lowest calorific value (37.4 MJ/kg). Oil from traditional hexane oil extraction had the highest calorific value (HHV) (38.7 MJ/kg). Renewable diesel yields through hydrotreatment of extracted oils were consistently higher than biodiesel yields through enzymatic transesterification of the same oils. The highest renewable diesel yield (15.8%) from batch HTL derived bio-oil had the highest calorific value (46.2 MJ/kg). However, the highest kerosene yield (9%) was obtained from in situ renewable diesel production through direct hydrotreatment of the SCG. The study showed that hydrothermal liquefaction was more efficient in producing oil from SCG than traditional solvent extraction but at the cost of losing valuable phytosterols present in the feedstock. As a bulk fuel, renewable diesel had a higher energy value than biodiesel, making it easier to blend into existing transportation fuels. The study provides useful information for the development of a sustainable waste-based bio-refinery in terms of attainable yields and processing options. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The depletion of world oil reserves currently positively impacts the development of biofuels such as biodiesel and bioethanol, as this fuel is a renewable and environmentally friendly alternative and is considered to have enormous potential to supply energy needs. The purpose of this research is to investigate the performance and exhaust emissions from single diesel direct injection diesel engine which is fueled by biodiesel-bioethanol-diesel. Biodiesel was obtained from a mixture of Jatropa curcas-Ceiba pentandra crude oil with each composition being 50% produced by degumming process, acid catalyzed esterification, and alkaline-catalyzed transesterification. Biodiesel-bioethanoldiesel fuel is mixed in several conditions ie B10BE5, B20BE8, B30BE10, B40BE13, and B50BE15. In general, engine performance for low blend of biodiesel and bioethanol is close to diesel, for some engine parameters such as engine torque, brake power, and brake thermal efficiency. The addition of biodiesel and bioethanol into diesel fuel also has implications for reduced carbon emissions and smoke opacity. Overall, based on test results it can be concluded that the biodiesel-bioethanol mixture in low concentration in diesel fuel qualifies as an alternative fuel in diesel engines. © 2020 Zibeline International Publishing Sdn.

AB  - Interest in biofuels is growing, and ethanol has been the most used biofuel as an additive and as a gasoline substitute and, it is considered a potential alternative to traditional fuels. Ethanol represents 17% of energy consumption in transportation in Brazil, the transport sector's share in the energy matrix is 32.4%, which is the second most energy-consuming sector. The production of first and second-generation ethanol in the same industrial plant presents better financial results compared to the isolated processes. Also, ethanol obtained from the sugarcane has renewability, biodegradability and provides CO2 emissions mitigation. The objective of the work is to perform an analysis of the ethanol with several levels of hydration in terms of energetic, economic, environmental and safety. The results showed that each 10% of water in ethanol dilution the temperature in the flame surround decreases by 4%. Besides, the ethanol with 20% of water dilution emits 20% less radiation compared to 10% of water dilution. Indeed, the energy consumed in the distillation to produce ethanol with 10% of water is double. On the other hand, this energy difference in the production of ethanol diluted with 30% of water is not enough to compensate for the losses in the energy use process. Also, large amounts of water in ethanol dilution might be unfeasible the use due to the total cost of transportation. Therefore, ethanol with 20% of water represents the more efficient, cleaner and safe fuel in free flame applications. © 2020 Tche Quimica Group. All rights reserved.

AB  - Microalgae have been mentioned as a promising feedstock for biodiesel production. In this study, microalgae Chlorella vulgaris (MCV) was cultivated in a bioreactor with wastewater. After biodiesel production from MCV oil via transesterification reaction, chemical and physical properties of MCV methyl ester were evaluated with regular diesel and ASTM standard. Besides, engine performance and exhaust emissions of CI engine fuelled with the blends of diesel-biodiesel were measured. The GC-MS analysis showed that oleic and linoleic acids were the main fatty acid compounds in the MCV methyl ester. Engine test results revealed that the use of biodiesel had led to a major decrease in CO and HC emissions and a modest reduction in CO2 emissions, whereas there was a minor increase in NOx emissions. Furthermore, there was a slight decrease in the engine power and torque while a modest increase in brake specific fuel consumption which are acceptable due to exhaust emissions reduction. The experimental results illustrate considerable capabilities of applied MVC biodiesel as an alternative fuel in diesel engines to diminish the emissions. © 2020 Sara Tayari et al., published by Sciendo 2020.

AB  - The current work aims to investigate the compatibility of n-Amyl alcohol in a mini-truck common rail direct injection (CRDI) compression ignition (CI) engine with exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) as a DeNOx technique. The n-Amyl alcohol is a renewable biofuel it effectively mitigates the demand for fossil fuels and reduces greenhouse gas emission. Palladium and Rhodium coated SCR catalyst was used to reduce the nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission. For SCR of NOx ammonia was used as a reductant. From the experimental results, it was noted that with an increase in the percentage of alcohol in the blends, a slight drop in brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and higher brake specific energy consumption (BSEC) was observed. Both NOx and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions could be reduced with the use of n-Amyl alcohol and a combination of SCR and EGR techniques. The maximum reduction of NOx can be successfully achieved with the use of 40N60D (40% n-Amyl alcohol &amp; 60% Diesel v/v) blend with SCR and 20% EGR at the slight cost of BTE. The engine can be successfully worked up to 40% of n-Amyl alcohol/diesel blends without causing any visible damage to the engine, with less NOx emissions. It is concluded that n-Amyl alcohol will be a sustainable next-generation biofuel for commercial vehicles. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This paper deals with the hydroprocessing of Fish Oil (FO) as a source to produce biofuel. The hydrotreating experiments were performed at 380°C and 50bar pressure over the CoMo/Al2O3 and CoMoRe/Al2O3 catalysts. Through hydrogenation of double bonds and carboxyl groups of Fatty Acids (FAs), accompanied by secondary hydrocracking and isomerization reactions, there results a mixture of normal &amp; isoparaffin with 13-22 carbon atoms per molecule with physicochemical characteristics similar to diesel fuel. The hydrotreatment of Straight Run Gas Oil (SRGO) mixed with 5% and 10% (FO) was also studied. The research focuses on the influence of the SRGO-FO ratio and of the catalyst type on the yields and the physiochemical properties of the obtained biofuel. The results show that the hydrotreatment of FO and of SRGO-FO mixtures is an alternative for biofuel production with characteristics similar to diesel fuel. © 2020 SYSCOM 18 S.R.L..

AB  - The objective of this study is to upgrade the pyrolysis oil obtained from coconut shells via thermal deoxygenation and catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) and compare the elemental properties of the upgraded bio-oil samples. The crude coconut shell pyrolysis oil (cr-CSPO) was obtained in 33% yield by intermediate pyrolysis (575°C) of pre-dried coconut shells. The higher heating value (HHV) of cr-CSPO was found to be 16.46 MJ/Kg. The thermal and catalytic upgrading was done at 250°C, 30 bar of hydrogen pressure, a reaction time of 3 h, and a stirring speed of 350 rpm. In the case of catalytic upgrading, 10% Pd/C (10 wt% of cr-CSPO) was used as the catalyst. Thermally heating the cr-CSPO under identical conditions without the catalyst provided oil of HHV 25.94 MJ/kg. Catalytic HDO of the cr-PCSO showed a noticeable increase in the HHV value to 30.57 MJ/kg. The results indicate significant improvement in the combustion properties of cr-CSPO by thermal treatment and more so by the catalytic HDO chemistry. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This paper investigated the nanostructure and oxidation reactivity of soot generated from biofuel 2,5-dimethylfuran pyrolysis with different CO2 additions and different temperatures in a quartz tube flow reactor. The morphology and nanostructure of soot samples were characterized by a low and a high resolution transmission electron spectroscopy (TEM and HRTEM) and an X-ray diffraction (XRD). The oxidation reactivity of these samples was explored by a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). Different soot samples were collected in the tail of the tube. With the increase of temperature, the soot showed a smaller mean particle diameter, a longer fringe length, and a lower fringe tortuosity, as well as a higher degree of graphization. However, the variation of soot nanostructures resulting from different CO2 additions was not linear. Compared with 0%, 50%, and 100% CO2 additions at one fixed temperature, the soot collected from the 10% CO2 addition has the highest degree of graphization and crystallization. At three temperatures of 1173 K, 1223 K, and 1273 K, the mean values of fringe length distribution displayed a ranking of 10% CO2 &gt; 100% CO2 &gt; 50% CO2 while the mean particle diameters showed the same order. Furthermore, the oxidation reactivity of different soot samples decreased in the ranking of 50% CO2 addition &gt; 100% CO2 addition &gt; 10% CO2 addition, which was equal to the ranking of mean values of fringe tortuosity distribution. The result further confirmed the close relationship between soot nanostructure and oxidation reactivity. © 2020, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The present examination explores the impact of utilizing palm biodiesel and decanol blends as a ternary blends in compression ignition engine. Artificial Neural network (ANN) and Response surface methodology (RSM) model is developed to predict and optimize decanol proportion in ternary blends. Test engine was operated with decanol mixing of 10%, 20%, and 30% by volume while the diesel percentage was kept 50% in all the samples at different load conditions. With the support of obtained data, regression equation for all the responses are generated based on RSM model with R2 &gt; 0.95. Further to improve the regression model, feed-forward back propagation ANN model is developed to replica the output of brake thermal efficiency, brake specific fuel consumption, oxides of nitrogen, hydrocarbon, smoke opacity and ignition delay period, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and exhaust gas temperature and MFB@90%. Based on the results, ANN predicts all the responses with R &gt; 0.99 and the maximum mean absolute average error is 1.879%. The RSM based optimization study prescribes 30% decanol, biodiesel 20% and diesel 50% sufficiently improve performance and decrease emission parameters. Even, the confirmation study with desirability level of 75.4% was carried at 3 trials for the purpose of authentication, maximum error of 5.27% and minimum of 1.33% error was observed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is the most widely accepted complement fuel for diesel engines due to its characteristic properties, environmental and strategic advantages. In recent years, the high cost of biodiesel and the competition with food has been reduced by using non-edible feedstocks. However, if further cost reduction is to be achieved, new methods of production should be adopted. In this study, an attempt has been made on the cost reduction by producing biodiesels from non-edible oils (hemp seed oil and tobacco seed oil) in the laboratory using a domestic blender. Parametric studies were conducted to determine the optimal conditions such as KOH dosage (0.5–1.5 wt%), reaction duration (50–100 min) and methanol to oil molar ratio (4.0–8.0) for low fatty acid hemp seed oil methyl ester (HSOME) and tobacco seed oil methyl ester (TSOME) production and to establish density and viscosity correlation for the HSOME and TSOME with diesel blends. Regression models were adopted in predicting the basic properties of HSOME and TSOME, and their blends with diesel fuel. Optimum conditions of 0.9 wt% of KOH and 1.1 wt% of KOH and reaction time of 70 and 80 min were obtained with more than 95% conversion for both HSOME and TSOME with methanol/oil molar ratio of 6:1. The cost estimation for HSOME and TSOME was conducted and the commercial value detected as ($1.35 per litre) and TSOME ($1.36 per litre). The respective energy efficiencies for HSOME and TSOME were 0.044 × 10−3 g/J and 0.0396 × 10−3 g/J. The fuel properties correlated with a high regression coefficient with biodiesel fraction and were similar to those found in literature and complied with both ASTM D6751 and EN 1421 standards. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Lipids from oleaginous yeasts emerged as a sustainable alternative to vegetable oils and animal fat to produce biodiesel, the biodegradable and environmentally friendly counterpart of petro-diesel fuel. To develop economically viable microbial processes, the use of residual feedstocks as growth and production substrates is required. Results: In this work we investigated sugar beet pulp (SBP) and molasses, the main residues of sugar beet processing, as sustainable substrates for the growth and lipid accumulation by the oleaginous yeast Lipomyces starkeyi. We observed that in hydrolysed SBP the yeast cultures reached a limited biomass, cellular lipid content, lipid production and yield (2.5 g/L, 19.2%, 0.5 g/L and 0.08 g/g, respectively). To increase the initial sugar availability, cells were grown in SBP blended with molasses. Under batch cultivation, the cellular lipid content was more than doubled (47.2%) in the presence of 6% molasses. Under pulsed-feeding cultivation, final biomass, cellular lipid content, lipid production and lipid yield were further improved, reaching respectively 20.5 g/L, 49.2%, 9.7 g/L and 0.178 g/g. Finally, we observed that SBP can be used instead of ammonium sulphate to fulfil yeasts nitrogen requirement in molasses-based media for microbial oil production. Conclusions: This study demonstrates for the first time that SBP and molasses can be blended to create a feedstock for the sustainable production of lipids by L. starkeyi. The data obtained pave the way to further improve lipid production by designing a fed-batch process in bioreactor. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Metal oxide modified nickel catalysts are highly desirable for the conversion of biomass-derived compounds to biofuels and valuable chemicals because of their low-cost and unique synergistic effects in catalytic reaction. Herein, a series of metal oxide modified nickel catalysts were scrutinized in the hydrodeoxygenation of steatic acid to diesel-range alkanes without any carbon loss as a model reaction. The results showed that MoOx modified Ni/SiO2 catalyst was the most active and selective for the hydrodeoxygenation of stearic acid under mild reaction conditions (260 °C and 3.0 MPa H2 partial pressure). The catalyst with an Ni/Mo molar ratio of 1, and that was reduced at an optimized temperature (500 °C), exhibited the best performance; this catalyst achieved a high selectivity (&gt;95%) to diesel-range alkanes at 100% stearic acid conversion. A high selectivity (&gt;60%) to C18 alkane and a less than 30% selectivity to C17 alkane were observed at 260 °C and 3.0 MPa H2 partial pressure. By selecting an appropriate support, the selectivity to C18 alkane can reach 95% at 100% stearic acid conversion over Ni–Mo/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. In contrast to Ni/SiO2, Ni–Mo/SiO2 was more efficient for C[dbnd]O hydrogenation and less active for C–C bond cleavage, which afforded a higher selectivity to long-chain hydrocarbons without any carbon loss. Detailed characterization, control experiments, and kinetic studies indicate that the high activity and selectivity to the C18 alkane arises from a synergy between Ni and MoOx. The Ni sites at the interface between the Ni metal and MoOx species play a role in the generation of hydride (Hδ−) species from H2 dissociation, and MoOx plays a role in promotion of fatty acids adsorption through adsorbing carboxylic groups at the oxygen vacancy of MoOx. The deep understanding of such synergic catalysis will provide significant clues for the rational design of bimetallic catalysts towards the production of diesel-range alkanes without any carbon loss from the hydrodeoxygenation of fatty acids/esters. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study provided a comparison of two species of microalgae growth in dairy wastewater treatment plant effluents. In optimum conditions their operation to biomass production, lipid accumulation and fatty acids methyl ester composition so as to biodiesel production is studied. For the first time, the not sterilized effluents of dairy wastewater treatment plant was used as the culture mediums of native microalgae, Chlorella sorokiniana strain pa.91, and another one Chlorella vulgaris. They were cultured under 5 light intensity levels so as to find optimum conditions to observed high biomass and lipid production. At the optimum light intensity the composition of fatty acids methyl ester in their lipids was analyzed by GC-MS. The light intensity of 7500 Lux was obtained as the optimum for both microalgae to produce high biomass. The biomass productivity of C. sorokiniana pa.91 and C. vulgaris in preliminary treated effluent at this light intensity was obtained 0.233 and 0.214 g L−1 day−1, respectively. This parameter in secondary treated effluent was achieved 0.185 and 0.166 g L−1 day−1, respectively. Moreover, the highest lipid content of their biomass was observed at the light intensity of 2500 Lux. At this light intensity and at the preliminary effluent the maximum lipid content of C. sorokiniana pa.91 and C. vulgaris was observed 31% and 34%, respectively and at the secondary one it was obtained 35% and 36.67%, respectively. Based on the results, the fatty acids composition in the lipids of microalgae C. sorokiniana pa.91 and C. vulgaris cultured in both effluents had the high amount of cetane number which is really useful for high quality biodiesel production. Also, the other valuable properties which produce the high quality biodiesel were the obtained amounts of CFPP and CP which shown a high performance potential biodiesel even at low temperatures. This feature was obtained, on the grounds that the unsaturated fatty acid was obtained more than saturated fatty acid. The nutrients-rich media of dairy wastewater effluents were applicable to growth both microalgae and useful biomass production, lipid accumulation and fatty acids profiling. Furthermore, the compounds of fatty acids had the best conditions to biodiesel production especially in cold weather areas. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Fuels and their components accumulate in soil, and many soil organisms are exposed to this pollution. Compared to intensive research on the effect of conventional fuel on soil, very few studies have been conducted on soil ecotoxicity of biofuels. Considering the limited information available, the present study evaluated the changes caused by the presence of biodiesel and diesel fuel in soil. The reaction of higher plants and soil organisms (microbial communities and invertebrates) was analysed. Conventional diesel oil and two types of biodiesel (commercial and laboratory-made) were introduced into the soil. Two levels of contamination were applied—5 and 15% (w/w per dry matter of soil). The plate method was used to enumerate microorganisms from soil contaminated with biodiesel and diesel fuel. Phytotoxicity tests were conducted by a 3-day bioassay based on the seed germination and root growth of higher plant species (Sorghum saccharatum and Sinapis alba). Fourteen-day ecotoxicity tests on earthworm were performed using Eisenia fetida. Based on the results of the conducted tests it was found out that the organisms reacted to the presence of fuels in a diverse manner. As to the microorganisms, both the growth and reduction of their number were noted. The reaction depended on the group of microorganisms, type of fuel and dose of contamination. The lipolytic and amylolytic microorganisms as well as Pseudomonas fluorescens bacteria were particularly sensitive to the presence of fuels, especially biodiesel. Fuels, even at a high dose, stimulated the growth of fungi. Monocotyledonous sugar sorghum plants were more sensitive to the presence of fuels than dicotyledonous white mustard. There was also a significant negative impact of contamination level on plant growth and development. Biodiesel, to a greater extent than conventional fuel, adversely affected the survival and volume of earthworms. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - The integration of easily available and under-exploited biomasses is considered a sustainable strategy in biorefining approaches. Mediterranean countries, especially Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia, offer such under-exploited waste of different origins. This study revealed the chemical composition and phytochemical characteristics of various agri-food side-products, marine residues, and wild grasses collected in the Maghreb region. Results showed that these wastes contained variable proportions of polysaccharides, lignin, constitute molecules (proteins, lipids, and inorganic molecules) and, various secondary metabolites, mainly flavonoids and condensed tannins. Based on this, the Mediterranean waste was divided into three categories. The first category included waste with high lignin content (40 wt%). The second category contained waste with lignin content below 10 wt% and structural carbohydrate content below 50 wt%. Additionally, the waste in this category comprised noticeable amounts of flavonoids and condensed tannins, particularly from thistle, speedwell, and spurge. Finally, the third category included waste with lignin content above 15 wt% and carbohydrate content in the range of 45–55 wt%. The results also showed that the waste in the third category has a chemical composition similar to that of raw materials envisioned for use in European or North American commercial biorefineries. The findings of this study indicate that the biomass waste employed in this study can be used to develop marketable bioproducts and may be a potential raw material for a biorefinery facility. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A one-step process that integrates cell disruption with lipid extraction from wet microalgae was proposed by using n-hexane/formic acid. The scanning electron microscopy showed that raw microalgae cells were completely disrupted. The derivative thermogravimetric analysis indicated that formic acid could lead to a fast-thermal decomposition of microalgae residues at the temperatures ranged from 175 to 280 °C. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that the intensities of C[dbnd]O vibrations increased with an increase of the carbonyl compounds. When microalgae were treated with this mixed solvent at an n-hexane/formic acid ratio of 9:2 (v/v) and an addition dosage of 80 mL/g wet microalgae at 80 °C for 2 h, the optimal crude lipid yield was 256.3 mg/g dry weight. A high fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) content of 83.6% was achieved, dominated by palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid, oleic acid, and linoleic acid. Compared with the conventional methods including n-hexane, ethanol, n-hexane/methanol, and chloroform/methanol without pre-treatment, the crude lipid yields increased by 15%–402%. Compared with the chloroform/methanol extraction supplemented by ultrasound, microwave, hydrothermal, and dilute nitric acid pre-treatments, the achieved FAME contents increased by 79%–99%. Additionally, the energy yield from n-hexane/formic acid extraction reached up to 8.55 kJ/g volatile solid. © 2020

AB  - In this study, a combined approach to produce fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and succinic acid from the biomass of the microalga Micractinium sp. IC-44 using ionic liquids (ILs) was presented. After 22 days of cultivation, the biomass productivity was 0.034 ± 0.001 g L−1day−1, and the lipid content was 11.5 ± 0.5%. Direct biomass transesterification using H2SO4 in the presence of IL [BMIM][HSO4] resulted in a FAME yield of 42.0 ± 4.3%, which exceeded the yields obtained after transesterification of extracted lipids (20.5 ± 3.5% using ILs and 27.1 ± 2.4% using methanol/chloroform) and direct biomass transesterification without using ILs (31.6 ± 1.7%). The residual biomass obtained after direct transesterification using ILs was subjected to acid hydrolysis (sugar yield was 81.1 ± 2.4%). The purified hydrolysate was fermented using Actinobacillus succinogenes 130Z to obtain a succinic acid yield of 0.67 g g−1 of fermentable sugars. Therefore, this study demonstrated the successful conversion of the Micractinium sp. IC-44 biomass into biodiesel and succinic acid. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgal biomass is a potential feedstock for biofuel production because of its oleaginous nature and fast growth rate. Furthermore, its cultivation does not compete with crop producing land and thereby eliminating food vs. fuel dilemma. This study describes a low-cost nutrient mediated cultivation method for growing lipid enriched algal biomass from Scenedesmus quadricauda in BG11 media in a raceway pond. A renewable heterogeneous catalyst is synthesized using calcium oxide obtained from calcination of waste egg shells and modified using cobalt nitrate hexahydrate by co-precipitation method. The synthesized catalyst is characterized by XRD, SEM, EDX, FTIR, TEM techniques. Lipid extracted from the biomass is converted to biodiesel using the synthesized catalyst. The formation of biodiesel is confirmed using 1H NMR, 13C NMR and GC-MS techniques. The result demonstrated that the CaO–Co catalyst has very high catalytic activity for biodiesel production. The integrated process described in this study has potential for producing environmentally benign fuels and a heterogeneous catalyst from renewable sources. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study aims to quantify life-cycle fossil energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) derived renewable diesel (RD) taking into consideration different feedstock classifications that are applicable to PFAD (residue, byproduct, or coproduct), and incorporating updated data for key processes. Under the three classifications, the PFAD to RD pathway was modeled using the Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Technologies (GREET®) model. PFAD-derived RD could reduce fossil energy consumption by 77%–88%, relative to petroleum diesel. GHG emissions are very sensitive to PFAD classification and coproduct handling methods. Considering the production of palm oil and PFAD and economic value, we maintain that PFAD should be treated as a byproduct in palm oil refineries. With this treatment, PFAD-derived RD could achieve 84% GHG emissions reductions, compared to the emissions of petroleum diesel. We also employed a substitution method to address the substitution of PFAD by other materials in the marketplace. Compared to coproduct allocation results, we found substituting PFAD by tallow, soy oil, barley, and canola oil results in lower GHG emissions. Due to high induced land-use change emissions associated with palm farming, if PFAD is treated as a coproduct with refined palm oil, PFAD-derived RD may not deliver GHG reductions. A sensitivity analysis identified key parameters such as palm fruit yield, oil extraction efficiency in oil mills, and energy use intensity for RD production affects LCA results significantly; future efforts to improve these parameters could result in further GHG reductions. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - The aim of this work was to enhance the biodiesel quality and hydrocarbon content of green microalga B. braunii strain KMITL 2 cultivated outdoor under several salinity conditions in a batch production. The enhancement would be such that the microalgal biodiesel qualities met or exceeded the current standard so that it would be a good raw material for biodiesel production. The microalga production was in 300 L open oval ponds, among various salinity levels tested (0–20 ppt), 5 ppt was the best for hydrocarbon production, yielding 54.2 ± 0.9% hydrocarbon content and 5.1 ± 0.4 g L−1 biomass. As the microalga production was scaled up by cultivation in 3,675 L open raceway pond under the 5 ppt condition, the microalga yielded a bit higher hydrocarbon content (58.8 ± 2.9%) but much lower biomass (2.5 ± 0.5 g L−1). The production in both oval and raceway ponds yielded a nearly identical biodiesel property (61.06–67.42 cetane number) which exceeded the value specified in international standards. Therefore, it was concluded that B. braunii strain KMITL 2 can be batch cultivated in an open pond at optimum salinity to yield sufficient hydrocarbon and biomass for biodiesel production. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. plant (Jatropha) is cultivated in many countries for biodiesel production. This is to provide for high energy demand and mitigate global warming from the combustion processes of fossil fuels. The production of Jatropha oil for biodiesel production in Botswana following the recent government decision to promote biofuels is likely to generate large volumes of non-oil biomass. The residual non-oil biomass material can be used in place of firewood in low-income communities. This is perceived to be one of the effective ways of utilising non-oil biomass from the plant. However, for the non-oil biomass material to be used effectively in place of firewood, its properties related to fuel value need to be investigated. The objective of this study was therefore to characterise the Jatropha non-oil biomass from Botswana material for effective use as solid fuel source. The characterisation results showed that Jatropha seed cake has relatively high calorific value of 19.28 MJ/kg, high bulk density of 0.75 MJ/kg, high fixed carbon content of 24.28 MJ/kg and low ash content of 5.04 MJ/kg, which are good properties for solid fuel source. The Jatropha seed cake also has more carbon content to the value of 46.15% when compared with the stem’s carbon content of 43.68% and the fruit husk carbon content of 36.05%. The thermal gravimetric analysis showed that the thermal degradation of the Jatropha seed cake is slow when compared to the other Jatropha biomass materials under investigation. It can, therefore, be concluded that, the Jatropha seed cake can be a good source of solid fuel when compared with the Jatropha stem and the Jatropha fruit husk. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In this paper, the exergy analysis and environmental assessment are performed to the biodiesel and diesel-fueled engine at full 294 Nm and 1800 r/min. The exergy loss rates of fuels are found as 15.523 and 18.884 kW for the 100% biodiesel (BDF100) (obtained from cooking oil) and Japanese Industrial Standard Diesel No. 2 (JIS#2) fuels, respectively. In addition, the exergy destruction rate of the JIS#2 fuel is found as 80.670 kW, while the corresponding rate of the BDF100 is determined as 62.389 kW. According to environmental assessments of emissions and nanoparticles of the fuels, the biodiesel (BDF100) fuel is more environmentally benign than the diesel (JIS#2) fuel in terms of particle concentration and carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions. So, it is better to use this kind of the 100% biodiesels in the diesel engines for better environment and efficiency in terms of the availability and environmental perspectives. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Consolidated bioprocesses for bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass into biodiesel feedstocks were developed. Palm empty fruit bunch (EFB) was biologically pretreated coupling with fungal lipid production (121.4 ± 2.7 mg/g-EFB) by lignocellulolytic oleaginous fungi prior to lipid production by oleaginous yeasts. In subsequent separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) of fungal pretreated EFB (FPEFB), the oleaginous yeast with the maximum lipid yield of 37.0 ± 0.1 mg/g-FPEFB was screened. While a higher lipid yield of 47.9 ± 1.5 mg/g-FPEFB was achieved in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) with less enzyme requirement. Fed-batch SSF of non-sterile FPEFB was proven as a practical and efficient strategy to increase lipid yield up to 53.4 ± 0.5 mg/g-FPEFB. Total lipid yield by both fungi and yeast was 165.0 ± 4.4 mg/g-EFB. Interestingly, the consolidated bioprocesses of enzyme and lipid production also achieved comparable total lipid yield of 149.3 ± 6.6 mg/g-EFB. These strategies may contribute greatly to cost-effective and sustainable bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass into biodiesel feedstocks. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Compressed natural gas (CNG) enrichment ignited by the diesel fuel in the compression ignition engine generally reveals low thermal efficiency and high carbon monoxide (CO) and total hydrocarbons (THC) emissions at low load due to the over-lean mixture. This paper aims to numerically study the improvement effectiveness of throttling on the efficiency and emissions in the conventional dual-fuel (CDF)/reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI) combustion modes with CNG mixture ignited by diesel and diesel/n-butanol blends at low load. Two pilot fuels and two combustion modes were compared by sweeping the intake air pressure (Pin) from 1.0 to 0.7 bar based on a fixed CA50 of 2 °CA ATDC, indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) of 2.5 bar approximately, and CNG substitution rate of 50%. The numerical results showed that reducing Pin can significantly improve the combustion efficiency and THC emission due to the increased fuel/air concentration. In comparison with CDF combustion, RCCI combustion obtains higher combustion efficiency and lower THC emission. CO is reduced gradually with the decreasing Pin in the RCCI combustion, and having the similar level as that in the CDF combustion at Pin of 0.7 bar. N-butanol addition can further reduce the CO and THC emissions in the RCCI combustion with the reducing Pin. Overall, it reveals that diesel blended with n-butanol as the pilot fuel in the RCCI combustion at low intake air pressure is more favorable for the improvement of efficiency and emissions at low load. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The incessant utilization of non-renewable energy sources persistently pollutes the earth's atmosphere and thus requires the immediate substitution by renewable energy sources such as biofuel. In this study, several nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria are screened for biodiesel production on the basis of biomass productivity, lipid productivity, lipid profiling, and harvesting potential. The assessment performed led to the identification of Nostoc sp. MCC41, a nitrogen ficxing cyanobacteria as promising species (0.39 day−1 specific growth rate, biomass productivity of 540 mg L−1 day−1, lipid productivity of 84 mg L−1 day−1 and 15.7% lipid content). A simple filtration experiment shows that almost 81% of the biomass of Nostoc sp. MCC41 is harvested without flocculation aid, while only 23–45% of the green algae (control) could be filtered. Based on the results, further optimization of Nostoc sp. MCC41 is carried out. The optimum light intensity to attain the highest lipid productivity is found to be 54 μmol photon m−2 s−1. Continuous illumination rather than other photoperiods is superior in terms of lipid productivity. Moreover, Nostoc sp. MCC41 could grow under mixotrophic conditions revealing the potential towards an organic carbon-rich wastewater treatment. At 0.5% glucose, the Nostoc sp. MCC41 exhibited nearly five-fold increase in biomass productivity when compared to the phototrophic conditions. Lipid profiling uncovered that Nostoc sp. MCC41 has a high concentration of palmitic acid, indicating its suitability for biodiesel. Given its easy mode of harvesting, ability to grow under mixotrophic condition, and ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, Nostoc sp. MCC41 can be considered as a potential and eco-friendly resource for efficient biodiesel production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biofuel production from algae feedstock has become a topic of interest in the recent decades since algae biomass cultivation is feasible in aquaculture and does therefore not compete with use of arable land. In the present work, hydrothermal liquefaction of both microalgae and macroalgae is evaluated for biofuel production and compared with transesterifying lipids extracted from microalgae as a benchmark process. The focus of the evaluation is on both the energy and carbon footprint performance of the processes. In addition, integration of the processes with an oil refinery has been assessed with regard to heat and material integration. It is shown that there are several potential benefits of co-locating an algae-based biorefinery at an oil refinery site and that the use of macroalgae as feedstock is more beneficial than the use of microalgae from a system energy performance perspective. Macroalgae-based hydrothermal liquefaction achieves the highest system energy efficiency of 38.6%, but has the lowest yield of liquid fuel (22.5 MJ per 100 MJalgae) with a substantial amount of solid biochar produced (28.0 MJ per 100 MJalgae). Microalgae-based hydrothermal liquefaction achieves the highest liquid biofuel yield (54.1 MJ per 100 MJalgae), achieving a system efficiency of 30.6%. Macro-algae-based hydrothermal liquefaction achieves the highest CO2 reduction potential, leading to savings of 24.5 resp 92 kt CO2eq/year for the two future energy market scenarios considered, assuming a constant feedstock supply rate of 100 MW algae, generating 184.5, 177.1 and 229.6 GWhbiochar/year, respectively. Heat integration with the oil refinery is only possible to a limited extent for the hydrothermal liquefaction process routes, whereas the lipid extraction process can benefit to a larger extent from heat integration due to the lower temperature level of the process heat demand. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Constant increase in energy demand has necessitated exploration of renewable and sustainable alternative sources of energy. Oleaginous yeast can serve as a potential feedstock for biodiesel production and the recovered de-oiled biomass can be used for production of energy-dense bio-crude by hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), a precursor for advanced bio-fuels. Life cycle assessment (LCA) of yeast based biofuel production is of existing and must be performed to gauge the possible environmental impacts and obtain a holistic picture. Accordingly, a detailed LCA study encompassing all the sub-processes in biodiesel and bio-crude production in a yeast biorefinery model was executed. Combined analysis of the mid-point and end-point indicators revealed that HTL and transesterification have comparatively higher impacts than the other sub-processes. Climate change indicator results show an emission of 4.02E3 kg CO2 eq. for HTL step and resource depletion for transesterification was estimated to be $773. The major reason for the impacts can be attributed to the usage of large amount of input energy/electricity for both the processes. The use of solvents, namely, methanol and glycerol in various downstream processing steps have contributed to around 60–70% towards the impact categories. Sensitivity analysis revealed higher lipid productivity can reduce CO2 emissions by 16% and resource depletion by 6.5%. The environmental performance of the process can be improved by replacing the electricity from fossil fuel with renewable energy sources such as solar or hydroelectric power with simultaneous recycling and reuse of the solvents and waste heat. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Feeding or cofeeding bio-oil (biomass pyrolysis oil) into the fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) has a direct impact on product distribution, reaction kinetics and deactivation of this key catalytic valorization strategy. In this work, we have analysed the impact in terms of the catalyst regeneration kinetics and energy balance of the unit. These factors are linked to the holistic viability of revamped refineries turned into biorefineries. Deactivated catalysts were obtained in FCC experiments using vacuum gasoil and raw bio-oil. The regeneration kinetics of coke combustion were analysed in a thermobalance, whereas the heats dissipated throughout the combustion (high heating values) were analysed in a calorimeter. Overall, the regenerator does not require major design amendments to treat bio-oil. We found a linear correlation between the higher heating value of the reactants and the coke produced, which enables to predict possible scenarios in the FCC unit. When incorporating higher amounts of bio-oil, the heat balance of the unit changes significantly: the temperature in the regenerator rises up to +36 K, requiring significant energy input for heating the bio-oil but offering the chance to recover more (electrical) energy when the proportion of bio-oil is greater than ca. 50%. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative fuel that has been used to replace petroleum diesel and to generate a positive impact on the economy and the environment. The aim of this paper was at identifying the variety of castor oil plant that could be cultivated and harnessed as bioenergy crops in Tlaltenango (Zacatecas, Mexico). Different varieties of wild castor (Ricinus communis L.) were studied, obtaining oil from its seeds and producing biodiesel from the variety with higher oil content by transesterification reaction at laboratory scale. Both oil and biodiesel were characterized physicochemically, and biodiesel quality was evaluated and compared with biofuels standards ASTM-D6751 (USA) and EN-14214 (European Union). Three varieties were identified; the denominated “green stem with wax, ashen fruit” showed the highest oil content (51.7 ± 5.6%), presenting a yield of the transesterification reaction of 61.44 ± 0.44%. The produced biodiesel complies with recommended value by both standards, except for the viscosity and the moisture, so its use is only suggested in blends with petroleum diesel. In conclusion, the variety “green stem with wax, ashen fruit” has the basic physicochemical characteristics for being considered an option in the industrial production of biodiesel in this city, being safe to use it in diesel engines. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The influence of glyphosate herbicide stress was investigated in the freshwater green microalgae Chlorella sorokiniana for metabolic growth and lipid induction. Glyphosate herbicide concentration at 30.10 ppm (IC50) elicited half-maximal inhibition during 96 h of incubation. After 24 days of harvest, C. sorokiniana produced 442.18 ± 9.1 mg/L and 427.73 ± 5.0 mg/L dcw of biomass in the control media and glyphosate IC50, respectively. A nominal reduction in biomass production was observed (~ 3.26%) due to stress in metabolic biosynthesis in glyphosate IC50 media. However, in contrast to biomass production, glyphosate IC50 stress aided in the induction of lipid biosynthesis in microalgae cells. The improvement in lipid synthesis was found to be ~17% higher in glyphosate IC50 compared to control. The chemical construction of the biomass, metabolites, and lipids of C. sorokiniana was analyzed via FTIR spectroscopy. The lipids extracted from C. sorokiniana were used for methanolic-H2SO4 catalyzed transesterification for the production of biodiesel. The synthesized biodiesel was analyzed by FTIR and 1H NMR. The conversion efficiency of microalgae lipids into biodiesel was estimated at ~77%. This study insights the use of glyphosate in lipid induction in microalgae to produce renewable and sustainable biofuels for the clean environment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper extends the application of laser-induced fluorescence imaging of OH &amp; CH2O (LIF-OH-CH2O) to provide a measure of heat release zones in turbulent, moderately dense spray flames of ethanol and biodiesel fuels. A custom filter is used to remove interference from stimulated Raman scattering arising from the liquid fragments. Mie scattering is measured jointly on a separate camera to co-locate the fluid fragments with respect to the reaction zones. It is found that while the overall spray flame structure is similar to that of a turbulent gaseous diffusion flame, additional complexities arise due to the continuous release of fresh fuel vapor from the evaporating fragments. Structures referred to as burning rings of different sizes are observed, and these are ignited by interfacing with a hot edge before they grow, propagate, and burnout. Statistics on the occurrence of these rings, with and without clouds of liquid fragments within them, are presented. These findings are common to both ethanol and biodiesel, although measurements in the latter were affected by strong fluorescence interference from the excited components in the biodiesel blend. © 2020 The Combustion Institute

AB  - In this study, pyrolysis kinetics and thermodynamic parameters of Safflower residues (SR) obtained from oil extraction were investigated by using TG/DSC-FTIR and py-GC/MS. Thermal analysis was performed from ambient temperature to 750 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. The first-order reaction kinetics model was applied to thermal analysis data to determine apparent kinetic parameters. Activation energy and pre-exponential factor were calculated as 76.60 kJ.mol−1 and 1.89x106 min−1, respectively. The thermodynamic parameters such as the change in Gibb's free energy, the difference in enthalpy and the entropy change were calculated to be 201.36 kJ mol−1, 71.79 kJ mol−1, and −0.196 kJ mol−1, respectively. TG/FTIR analysis revealed that CO2, C6H5OH, and C[dbnd]C functional group as the main pyrolysis gas products. According to Py-GC/MS results of SR, the presence of high energy-containing compounds among the pyrolysis products was proved. All these results show that SR is suitable for pyrolysis to produce biofuel and/or chemicals. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work is aimed at the development of a semi-continuous mechanochemical process for biodiesel production and the subsequent valorization of glycerol, its by-product, via its conversion into calcium diglyceroxide using the same mechanochemical reactor. This basic solid catalyzes the methanolysis of vegetable oils. The implementation of a semi-continuous process allows both the preparation of the solid catalyst and the methanolysis process, overcoming the miscibility problems of methanol and oil. Thus, a biodiesel yield higher than 90% is reached using a methanol:oil molar ratio close to stoichiometric value and 1.5 wt. % catalyst, after passing through the reactor with a flow rate between 4 and 45 L/h. This new process for biodiesel production can easily be scaled up and applied to the conversion of used cooking oils, without any significant yield decrease. A cost study was also performed, demonstrating that this is more economical than the conventional batch stirring-based process. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lignocellulose is a widely available carbon source and a promising feedstock for the production of advanced second-generation biofuels. Nonetheless, lignin, one of its major components, is largely underutilized and only considered an undesired byproduct. Through catalytic hydrotreatment, the highly condensed lignin can be partially depolymerized into a range of monomers. However, its recalcitrance and the presence of aromatic fragments linked by C-C bonds require extensive cracking, which is challenging to achieve. Here, a two-step strategy is reported in which an initial pretreatment step with ozone is used prior to catalytic hydrotreatment to boost lignin depolymerization. Three types of lignin (Kraft, pyrolytic, and Fabiola organosolv) are used as feedstocks and the ozonation step is performed under ambient conditions with either methanol or ethanol as the solvent. The pretreatment is shown to have a positive effect on the subsequent hydrotreatment reaction (Pd/C, 350 °C, 100 bar H2) and gives product oils with significantly lower Mw (up to 43% lower), higher volatility, and improved calorific values (up to 45.3 MJ kg−1) compared to a direct hydrotreatment. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Terpenoids have drawn much attention to scientists in synthesizing high-performance bio- jet fuels due to their ring structures, which feature potential high densities. Here, a facile biphasic catalytic process has been developed for the production of high-density tricyclic hydrocarbon biofuels from a monoterpenoid, 1,8-cineole, using sulfuric acid (H2SO4) as the homogeneous catalyst. A ~100% conversion of 1,8-cineole and a &gt; 40% carbon yield of cyclic dimers were achieved at 100 °C within two hours. The mechanism for the acid-catalyzed conversion of 1,8-cineole to cyclic hydrocarbon dimers were explored. In particular, the formation of the diene intermediates and the following dimerization of dienes was essential to synthesize tricyclic terpene dimers. The biphasic catalytic process accelerated the deoxygenation rate and enabled the dimerization with the aid of organic solvent while controlling the reaction rates to avoid the formation of solid residues. Moreover, this process also facilitated the product separation by organic solvent extraction while enabling easy recycle of the homogenous catalysts. © 2020

AB  - This study explored the potential of triticale feedstock for biofuel biorefining scenarios that included (i) producing ethanol, (ii) biochemically producing acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE), and annexing catalytic processes to ethanol production for (iii) butanol and (iv) hydrocarbons (liquefied petroleum gas, gasoline, jet fuel, diesel). Based on simulations in Aspen Plus, the net greenhouse gas reduction (GHG) and minimum fuel energy price (MFEP) were determined. The maximum contracting prices of triticale (MCP) were then determined and benchmarked against historic animal feed prices to ascertain market competition. Thus, producing ethanol had the lowest MFEP of 18.3 US$/GJ and highest GHG reduction of 81%, while ABE had the highest MFEP of 27.3 GJ/kg and lowest GHG reduction of 63%; therefore, catalytically producing butanol was preferable (MFEP = 22 US$/GJ). If a CAPEX rebate of 30% is applied to the ethanol and butanol scenarios, the chances that existing animal feed prices outcompeted the MCPs were 50-98%. For the hydrocarbon fuels, the MFEPs were 60% higher than the fossil equivalent, though the GHG reduction was 75%. If the jet fuel product received a carbon tax rebate, the chances of the animal feed market outcompeting the MCP were only 22%. Thus, the need for incentivizing mechanisms for biofuels was further emphasized. Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Renewable fuel from the hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) pathway represents a promising short-term option for reducing fossil fuel use in transportation. However, some life-cycle assessments (LCAs) have shown that HEFA diesel and jet fuel may have higher life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than the fossil fuels they replace. Many of these studies examined HEFA fuel derived from oilseed feedstocks. Here, results and methodology from 20 LCAs of HEFA fuel from oilseeds are reviewed in an effort to determine the sources of variability in the reported life-cycle GHG emissions of HEFA fuels. Although there was a 61–63% reduction in median life cycle GHG emissions of HEFA biojet and renewable diesel compared to conventional petroleum fuels, this review highlights the importance of standardized methodologies for life-cycle assessment (e.g., CORSIA, RSB) and indicates the need to prevent the conversion of forest land for biofuel production, as well as the potential opportunity for alternative oilseeds such as camelina and carinata as feedstocks to produce HEFA fuels with lower life-cycle GHG emissions. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - The poor biomass titer and biodiesel productivity under natural sunlight are the major challenges for commercialization of algae-biodiesel. Apart from engineering the nutritional medium and CO2 input strategies, the photobioreactor (PBR) design needs high attention to increase light utilization efficiency. Hence, a novel bubble-driven internal mixer was designed for providing frequent light/dark fluctuation which can improve light utilization efficiency and installed in a bubble-column PBR (BC-PBR) to improve productivities of biomass and biodiesel from Chlorella sp. Without any extra energy requirement (via aeration), in 10 L scale BC-PBR with mixer under simulated sunlight, the productivities of biomass and biodiesel were increased by 13% and 62%, respectively, compared to without mixer. Under natural sunlight, the improvement of biomass productivity was 33% with mixer arrangement and final biomass of 8.6 g L−1 was achieved. Further to improve biodiesel productivity and quality under natural sunlight, the lipid induction was started right after the algae growth of 4.2 g L−1 (at the time of highest biomass productivity, 1.4 g L−1 day−1). Consequently, a very highest biodiesel productivity of 753 mg L−1 day−1 (induction-phase) was achieved. To the best of authors knowledge, this is the first study to report bubble-driven mixer in microalgae cultivation technology. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: The MnO2 nanoparticles, when used as catalyst, determine an enhanced reaction rate of the transesterifications process thus being very attractive for biodiesel production. One of the current limitations of the biofuel production by using MnO2 nanoparticles as catalyst is given by the reaction conditions. This work intends to improve the transesterification reaction efficiency through the use of a microwave field. It can generate large quantities of energy that lead to a good molecular motion thus favoring the transesterification process without altering the molecular structure. The aim of the present research is to explore the possibility of carrying out the microwave-assisted transesterification of grapes residues and seeds oil through the use of MnO2 nanoparticles as catalysts, as well as yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), to efficiently obtain biofuel end product. Methods: Both chemically and biochemically (using plant extracts) synthesized MnO2 nanoparticles were produced and characterized by different techniques like TEM, XRD, BET, XPS, VSM. The analysis of obtained biofuel was performed by GC–MS. Results: The comparison of results revealed that the samples prepared using plant extracts have morphologic properties higher than chemically prepared sample. MnO2 nanoparticles obtained by the use of oregano extracts were further tested for microwave assisted transesterification studies. Conclusions: The surface area of the MnO2 nanoparticles biochemically synthesized was four times higher than the nanoparticles synthesized by chemical method. The MnO2-oregano nanoparticles presented the best catalytic activity for biodiesel production as compared to the yeast catalyst. The use of microwave field for transesterification further enhances the efficiency of the process. Graphic Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Coconut meal, a waste product left after coconut milk processing, was collected and utilized as raw substrate for biofuel production. Biofuel production was produced via two steps. Biodiesel was first produced from coconut meal’s oil. Afterward, bioethanol was produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using coconut waste after oil extraction as the sole carbon source. In this study, oil extraction methods, including chill and centrifugation, fermentation, and dry processing, were determined. The highest yield was obtained from dry processing (42.2%). The moisture and free fatty acid content of waste coconut oil (WCO) was 0.1% and 0.3–0.5%, respectively. Therefore, WCO was favourable to use as a substrate for biodiesel production. The highest biodiesel yield (98.1%) was observed from an alkali catalyst. Fuel properties of biodiesel from WCO met the biodiesel standard of the USA (ASTM D6751-07) and Europe (EN 14214). Thereafter, solid coconut waste (SCW) after oil extraction was collected and pre-treated using 50% NaOH. Cellulose content (62.1%) significantly increased after alkali pre-treatment. Thereafter, pre-treated SCW was hydrolysed with cellulase derived from Trichoderma viride and Aspergillus niger. Glucose (20.3 g/L) was a major end product in enzymatic hydrolysate. SCW hydrolysate was utilized as fermentation medium without nutritional supplementation. The production of ethanol constantly increased and reached 8.5 g/L (equivalent to 82.4% of theoretical yield) after 60 h. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Phytoremediation is an ecofriendly remediation practice for contaminated soils. This study evaluated the efficiency of cockspur grass (Echinochloa crus-galli) as a phytoremediation plant species by measuring the heavy metal(loid) uptake. In addition, for determining a viable route to valorize the phytoremediation byproduct, biodiesel was produced by the conversion of contaminated cockspur grass seeds through noncatalytic transesterification with a porous medium. From a series of experimental studies, this study confirmed that a substantial amount of heavy metal(loid)s was translocated into cockspur grass, and their removal efficiency after 3 weeks was as follows: Ni ≥ Cu > Co > Zn > Mn > Fe > As. Prior to the transesterification study, lipid content (11.6 wt %), a feedstock for biodiesel production, in cockspur grass seeds was estimated by the thermogravimetric analysis and the Soxhlet extraction test. Because the lipid extract from cockspur grass seeds contained a substantial amount of organic and inorganic impurities, biodiesel synthesis from a conventional transesterification method was negligible. However, biodiesel yield from noncatalytic transesterification using a porous medium reached 98% at 390 °C. The yield of biodiesel decreased at ≥400 °C due to biodiesel thermal cracking. This study also revealed that the noncatalytic transesterification of cockspur grass seeds into biodiesel was affected by the steric factors (collision frequency), evidenced by the carbon chain length of the acyl acceptor that was inversely proportional to the biodiesel yield.

AB  - Background: Despite their potential as biofuel resources, large-scale production of biofuels from microalgae is still uncertain primarily due to a lack of feasibility of the process and that it proves to be capital and energy intensive. Therefore, an integration of microalgal cultivation with other processes for achieving an inexpensive nutrient and energy use is an important issue. In the present study, the potential of the flue gas and the wastewater of a sugar factory to support microalgae growth for biofuel and bio-fertilizer production is evaluated. Methods: The study was carried out by following a case study approach; an Ethiopian sugarcane-processing factory, Metahara sugar and ethanol production factory, was selected for this purpose. Conceptual microalgal biofuel production was integrated with the real sugarcane-processing factory, and the process was evaluated with regard to the product outputs and energy requirements. Results: The integrated process model shows that three products, biodiesel, upgraded biogas, and bio-fertilizer with production capacities of 188 tons/year, 1,974,882 m3/year and 42 tons/year, respectively, were produced. For the production of these products, the electricity and thermal energy demand of the integrated process amounted to 1822.13 and 3244.99 MWh/year, respectively. A sensitivity analysis shows that the oil content of the algae, the nitrogen content of the waste, the oil extraction efficiency, and the transesterification efficiency are the main factors which affect the biodiesel production capacity of the integrated process. Conclusions: This case study approach investigated the potential of a future possible bio-refinery and environmental pollution reduction concept by integrating microalgae biomass production with sugarcane-processing factory wastes and by-products. It was found that the factory wastes and by-products have a significant potential for a viable biofuel production from microalgae. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Biofuels provide high oxygen content for combustion and do modify properties that influence the engine operation process such as viscosity, enthalpy of vaporization, and cetane number. Some requirements of performance, fuel consumption, efficiency, and exhaust emission are necessary for the validation of these biofuels for application in engines. This work studies the effects of the use of diethyl ether (DEE) in biodiesel-ethanol blends in a DI mechanical diesel engine. The blends used in the tests were B80E20 (biodiesel 80%-ethanol 20%) and B76E19DEE5 (biodiesel 76%-ethanol 19%-DEE 5%). Fossil diesel (D100) and biodiesel (B100) were evaluated as reference fuels. The results revealed similar engine effciencies among tested fuels at all loads. The use of B100 increased CO and NOx and decreased THC compared to D100 at the three loads tested. B80E20 fuel showed an increase in NOx emission in comparison with all fuels tested, which was attributed to higher oxygen content and lower cetane number. THC and CO were also increased for B80E20 compared to B100 and D100. The use of B76E19DEE5 fuel revealed reductions in NOx and CO emissions, while THC emissions increased. The engine efficiency of B76E19DEE5 was also highlighted at intermediate and more elevated engine load conditions. © 2020 MDPI AG. All rights reserved.

AB  - The demand for renewable resources, surplus availability, low cost and lower environmental impact has led to the utilization of bio-glycerol into high-value derivatives and functional chemicals for sustainability of the bio-diesel industry. The production of bio-fuel additives is of great interest as there is a gradual shift from petro-based chemicals to green chemicals. This work involves the direct synthesis of oxygenated fuel additives, 1,3-dioxalane and 1,3-dioxane from glycerol and benzyl alcohol over FeCl3/MCM-41 catalyst. The reaction progresses successfully to produce 1,3-dioxalane primarily by in-situ oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and subsequent condensation reaction of benzaldehyde with glycerol. Glycerol primarily acted as green solvent to facilitate the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and as a fuel additive precursor to produce 1,3-dioxalane in the preceding reaction. FeCl3/MCM-41 catalyst presented high performance achieving 92% glycerol conversion with 75% selectivity to 1,3-dioxalane in a reaction performed at 100 °C for 60 min. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Refined pyrolysis bio-oil was produced via the pretreatment and esterification of pyrolysis bio-oil over 732-type ion-exchange resin. The main parameters of fuel property such as components, low calorific value and viscosity of refined pyrolysis bio-oil were analyzed. Different volume fractions of refined pyrolysis bio-oil were added to neat diesel to prepare bio-fuel blends. Combustion performances and emission characteristics of engine fueled with bio-fuel blends were analyzed at various loads. The results show that after esterification, the amount of esters and ketones in the crude pyrolysis bio-oil was significantly increased while the contents of acids, phenols and ethers were reduced. Compared with crude pyrolysis bio-oil, the pH value of refined pyrolysis bio-oil was improved to 5.6, the low calorific value increased by 14.89%, and the kinematic viscosity decreased by 10.13%. At the same load, the equivalent brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) of bio-fuel blends was increased, the maximum cylinder pressures and the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) were both decreased but the peak of instantaneous heat release was increased slightly, and the exhaust gas temperatures also rose up. With the increase of refined pyrolysis bio-oil in bio-fuel blends, the difference between bio-fuel blends and neat diesel in the above indicators was more obvious. Besides, bio-fuel blends produced more HC, CO and smoke emissions but less NOx emissions than neat diesel. © 2020 Energy Institute

AB  - Biofuel stoves are an important source of black carbon (BC) emissions, which have adverse effects on the environment and human health, especially in rural areas. However, there have been only limited studies of BC emissions from residential biofuel stoves based on real-time measurements. In this study, a photo-acoustic extinctiometer (PAX)-based real-time measurement system was employed to monitor the emission characteristics of corncobs, corn stalks, cotton stalks and poplar branches in simple or improved stoves (with a total of 16 units) in Hebei Province, China. The real-time and phased emissions of BC, fine particulate matter (PM2.5), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) were assessed, and the effects of stove type and fuel on emissions were analyzed. Under the same conditions, polar branches were associated with the highest BC emission factors (EFs) of up to 2.64 ± 0.42 g kg−1, while the EFs for improved stoves were higher than those for simple stoves. During the ignition phase, BC emissions were found to be low, while the later addition of fuel dramatically increased emissions, followed by a gradual decrease until the next fuel addition. The phased results show that the flaming phase had the highest BC emission rate, the fuel addition phase was associated with the highest BC EF. The BC emission rates and EFs for the ignition, fuel addition, flaming and smoldering phases ranged from 0.0014–0.014, 0.11–6.32, 0.18–2.24 and 0.03–0.32 mg s−1, and from 0.04–0.18, 0.38–9.53, 0.45–3.55 and 0.12–1.01 g kg−1, respectively. This study assessed the BC emissions from residential biofuel stoves using a larger sample size than in prior work. The results increase our understanding of the BC emissions process, which is helpful in terms of improving the accuracy of BC EF estimations. The real-time measurement process described herein is also expected to provide new approaches to minimizing BC emissions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sustainable and economical production of butanol via acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation faces several major challenges, including high feedstock cost, low butanol yield, and low butanol productivity. To address these challenges, low-cost food waste was used as feedstock for ABE production in batch and continuous immobilized-cell fermentation by a recombinant high-butanol production strain Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum deltptabuk. Food waste was first liquefied and saccharified to obtain fermentable sugars. After that, food waste hydrolysates were fed into both batch and continuous immobilized-cell fermentation systems to produce ABE. In the batch fermentation, only 14.32 g/L ABE was produced using food waste hydrolysates medium. However, when food waste hydrolysate medium was fed into the continuous immobilized-cell fermentation, remarkable increases of ABE production, yield, and productivity were achieved. At the dilution rate of 0.1 h-1, 19.65 g/L ABE was produced with an ABE yield of 0.43. At the dilution rate of 0.39 h-1, the highest ABE productivity (4.56 g/L/h) was obtained, which was 23 times higher than that in the batch fermentation. This study for the first time demonstrated efficient conversion of food waste to butanol via continuous immobilized-cell fermentation to achieve high titer and productivity, which would potentially support the advanced utilization of organic waste materials for biofuel production.

AB  - Developing sulfonic-acid-supported catalysts with superacidity and hydrophobicity is of great importance for many acid-catalyzed reactions where H2O is generated. Herein, a novel hydrophobic superacidic biochar is first reported via a diazo grafting method using halogen-substituted amino-benzenesulfonic acids and 4-tert-butylaniline as sulfonating and hydrophobic reagents, respectively. The resultant biochar has a high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area (400-700 m2·g-1), acid concentration (up to 1.5 mmol·g-1), and H2O contact angle (above 134°). The synergistic effect of superacidity and hydrophobicity greatly improves the catalytic alkylation reactions of 4-ethylphenol-phenylmethanol and 2-methylfuran-cyclic ketones for the synthesis of renewable high-density fuels. The hydrophobic superacidic biochar shows higher catalytic conversion and selectivity than those of its counterparts without hydrophobicity or superacidity. Meanwhile, it is also far superior to commercial Amberlyst-15 and the traditional sulfonated biochar. Finally, the catalyst is stable without obvious activity reduction after cycling. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The ever-increasing demand on highly efficient decentralized power generation with low CO2 emission has made microturbines for power generation in micro gas turbine (MGT) systems popular when running on biofuels as a renewable source of energy. This document presents a state-of-the-art design, and optimization (in terms of design, performance and emission control) of a micro-turbine renewable energy combustor that fits into the existing Bladon 12kWe recuperated microturbine plenum while running on a range of biofuels as it can successfully provide the required power of the MGT. Governing equations for in-depth analysis of the combustor consist of manufacturer empirical data to simulate system-level operation with respect to replacement of the fossil with biofuels. The Model developed and validated at the company's ISO conditions confirms the output power of the new combustor fits the conventional system with slight eco-energy improvements. The modeling of the combustor in a complete microturbine assembly system is performed, then was utilized to further analysis of the microturbine with the designed combustor. The results gave on average 46.7% electrical efficiency, 83.2% system efficiency, 12 kWe electrical power, and 90% recuperator effectiveness at nominal operating conditions of microturbine (MT). Sensitivity analyses evaluate changes in performance with respect to fuel phase (e.g., liquid or gaseous) and design variables (e.g., orientation, shape, and dimensions of combustor), leading to energy optimization of the unit. Findings demonstrate that the combustor in microturbine can meet the target performance specifications of a company conventional diesel microturbine with significant savings. An objective function including both combustor and recuperator technical energy data is defined for finding the best ratio of fuel and air and their flow rates to find the most effective operating points for the operation of MT. Annual time series simulations completed for Coventry, West Midlands, United Kingdom indicate a new combustor can reduce operational costs of diesel fuel combustor by 8%, 2%, 36%, and 25% when supplying bioethanol, DME, biogas, and NG, respectively. Annual operating time of the renewable microturbine combustor at rated capacity included an 11% reduction in exergy loss with biogas fuel relative to diesel fuel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A two-stage pyrolysis of wood was conducted to produce a phenol-rich bio-oil. The two-stage pyrolysis process included auger and fluidized bed reactors connected in series. In this study, the effects of temperatures of the auger and fluidized bed reactors and the type of fluidizing medium were mainly investigated. The auger reactor temperature was varied from room temperature to about 290 °C, whereas the fluidized bed reactor temperature ranged from about 500 to 700 °C. As the auger reactor temperature rose from about 20 to 290 °C, the gas yield increased from 27 to 31 wt%. At about 290 °C, the production of phenol was greatly enhanced. A high fluidized bed reactor temperature favored the formation of phenol, efficiently exploiting the weakened bond strength between C (benzene) and methoxy group of lignin molecules caused by heat treatment in the auger reactor. The use of nitrogen as the fluidizing medium drastically increased phenol production, which was achieved by reducing reactions of phenol produced inside the fluidized bed reactor with other components. In the current study, the maximum phenol content in bio-oil reached about 16 wt%. Bio-oil with a high phenol content has good potential as a reactant in the phenol resin synthesis. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To promote hydrocracking and isomerization activities of bifunctional catalyst for the conversion of methyl palmitate into jet biofuel, phosphotungstic acid (HPW) loaded on Ni/MCM-41 catalyst enhanced strong acidity to strengthen conversion pathways of hydrocracking and isomerization. In the bifunctional catalytic system, Ni catalyzed hydrodeoxygenation and dehydrogenation of methyl palmitate to produce 1-pentadecene, while acid sites catalyzed further conversion of 1-pentadecene to produce jet fuel range hydrocarbons. Quantum chemistry calculation showed that activation energy in chemisorption process of 1-pentadecene onto acid sites significantly reduced from 203.9 kJ/mol with MCM-41 to 81.6 kJ/mol with HPW. Since bond order of β-scission site in 1-pentadecene over HPW was 0.93% lower than that over MCM-41, and Hirshfeld atomic charge of carbenium ion in 1-pentadecene over HPW (0.0722) was much higher than that over MCM-41 (0.0473), HPW showed better catalytic activities than MCM-41 in both hydrocracking and isomerization processes. The overall selectivity of jet biofuel increased to 86.1% with 47.1% n-alkane selectivity and 8.3% iso-alkane selectivity, due to improved strong acid density from 0.563 to 0.730 mmol/g over 20% HPW-Ni/MCM-41 catalyst. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The effects of light spectra on cell concentration, cell size, biomass production, proximate composition, pigment content, and fatty acid content in Chlorella vulgaris during two growth phases were measured. Growth rates were higher with white (0.70 division day−1) and blue light (0.67 divisions day−1). Cell size was greater in the exponential growth with yellow light (16.29 μm) versus blue light (14.26 μm). Higher organic dry weight (ODW) values were observed during exponential growth under green light (70.58 pg cell−1) compared with white light (36.56 pg cell−1). Proximate composition differed significantly by effect of light spectra and growth phases. Protein content was significantly higher in the exponential growth with white light (34.42%) and green (31.64%) light. Carbohydrate levels were significantly higher during stationary growth under yellow light (27.05%). In the exponential growth, lipid content was significantly higher with blue light (18.74%). Biomass productivity was highest in exponential growth phase with blue light (0.064 gL-1 day-1), meanwhile, in stationary growth phase yellow light (0.031 gL-1 day-1). Chlorophyll a and carotenoid levels were significantly greater during exponential growth with green and yellow lights. Fatty acid content was significantly modified by the light spectra and growth phase. The predominant saturated fatty acid was C:16:0 (palmitic acid), ranging between 10.26 (green light and exponential growth) and 20.01% (white light and stationary growth). The content of C18:1n-9 was higher (28.34 %) with the white light in the stationary growth, and C18:3n-3 content was greater with white (41.41%) and blue light (40.82%) in the exponential growth. It was concluded that blue light is the most suitable condition to induce biomass productivity and lipid content on both growth phases. Blue light during the stationary growth phase induces the production of lipids and saturated fatty acids (SFAs) which are suitable for biodiesel production. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Fossil fuels, which represent an important villain for the terrestrial ecosystem, are non-renewable sources of energy, which prompt many discussions about how long petroleum will remain available for use. As an alternative, new energy sources have been explored, including biofuels, such as biodiesel and ethanol. However, their use can raise some problems, such as lower storage stability associated with poor oxidation stability and lower energy availability, which affect consumption, emissions, and energy efficiency. In this context, a comprehensive study with structural description, theoretical calculations, and calorific power test was performed for a new halogen chalcone 4-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-[4-(2-oxo-2-phenylethoxy)phenyl]butan-2-one to understand its supramolecular arrangement and physicochemical properties. The structural description was carried out by X-ray diffraction with the contribution of Hirshfeld surfaces. The theoretical calculations were carried out using density functional theory with the contribution of calorific power determined by a calorimetric pump. All observed results characterize the new chalcone as a potential additive for biofuels. Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The adverse effects of fossil fuels on the environment and the rapid exhaustion of oil reserves are major concerns in the current global energy demand scenario. As a result, biofuels have emerged as promising alternate fuel due to their renewability, clean emissions and economic advantages over petroleum diesel. Biofuels are obtained from renewable sources such as vegetable oils, animal fat, microalgae, etc. Amongst these, waste cooking oil is considered to be an economical feedstock. This review focuses on different pretreatment methods for waste cooking oil and its lab-scale catalytic transesterification to biodiesel. Homogeneous, heterogeneous and enzymatic catalysts are compared based on reaction conditions, method employed and product yield. The purification steps, biodiesel properties and engine emissions profile are also discussed. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - An alternative source of biofuels is through the use of biowaste, as an estimated 20 million dry tons of volatile organic compounds is deposited in U.S. municipal wastewaters every year. Most of the energy content is not recovered, though biowaste is theoretically a colossal source of renewable energy. Biocrude diesel can be converted from wet biowaste via a process called hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), which can be created from various feedstocks such as algae, swine manure, and food processing waste. Previous experiments were conducted in a single-cylinder diesel engine used a diesel blend consisting of 10% and 20% HTL fuel. Preliminary results showed that the HTL blends had roughly similar power and emissions in comparison to pure diesel. In order to fully understand what the spray and combustion is like, it is necessary to study these mixtures in a constant volume chamber. The experiments were conducted at different temperatures and atmospheric conditions, revealing that the HTL blends has similar combustion and soot characteristics when compared to diesel. The HTL blends has roughly the same amount of apparent heat release rate and combustion pressure as diesel and performs better under low oxygen concentrations. The HTL fuel blends resulted in a shorter spray penetration length of HTL fuel than pure diesel, though showed more soot emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The bio-conversion of fatty oils recovered from chicken waste and Karanja by both enzymatic and microwave-assisted transesterification (MATE) into fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were performed in the present investigation. Evaluation of physicochemical properties and yield of biodiesel produced reveals the production of esters from chicken waste oil to be effective than the counterparts obtained from karanja oil. Intensification of transesterification process with chicken waste oil was carried out by employing protic deep eutectic solvents (pDES) for production of high octane methyl esters (HOME). The thermophysical evaluation of synthesized pDES show low values of density, viscosity and refractive index which decrease with the further increase in temperature. The use pDES reduces the mass transfer limitation in formation of biodiesel formation at the lowest acyl acceptor ratio of 1:4. Response surface methodology based optimization for microwave-assisted biodiesel production indicate the usage of the lowest power of 1.4 kW with a minimum volume of pDES (8%) at the optimal time of 25 min yields 96.4% pure biodiesel. The composition of obtained biodiesel was evaluated with GC–MS. The resulting biodiesel obtained is suitable additive to mineral based fuels. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Macaw palm is a highly oil-producing plant, which presents high contents of free fatty acids, being a promising feedstock for biofuel production. The current chemical routes are costly and complex, involving highly harsh industrial conditions. Enzymatic processing is a potential alternative; however, it is hampered by the scarce knowledge on biocatalysts adapted to this acidic feedstock. This work describes a novel lipase isolated from the thermophilic fungus Rasamsonia emersonii (ReLip), which tolerates extreme conditions such as the presence of methanol, high temperatures, and acidic medium. Among the tested feedstocks, the enzyme showed the highest preference for macaw palm oil, producing a hydrolyzate with a final free fatty acid content of 92%. Crystallographic studies revealed a closed conformation of the helical amphipathic lid that typically undergoes conformational changes in a mechanism of interfacial activation. Such conformation of the lid is stabilized by a salt bridge, not observed in other structurally characterized homologs, which is likely involved in the tolerance to organic solvents. Moreover, the lack of conservation of the aromatic cluster IxxWxxxxxF in the lid of ReLip with the natural mutation of the phenylalanine by an alanine might be correlated with the preference of short acyl chains, although preserving catalytic activity on insoluble substrates. In addition, the presence of five acidic amino acids in the lid of ReLip, a rare property reported in other lipases, may have contributed to its ability to tolerate and be effective in acidic environments. Therefore, our work describes a new fungal biocatalyst capable of efficiently hydrolyzing macaw oil, an attractive feedstock for the production of “drop-in” biofuels, with high desirable feature for industrial conditions such as thermal and methanol tolerance, and optimum acidic pH. Moreover, the crystallographic structure was elucidated, providing a structural basis for the enzyme substrate preference and tolerance to organic solvents. © Copyright © 2020 Rade, da Silva, Vieira, Milan, de Souza, de Melo, Klein, Bonomi, de Castro, Murakami and Zanphorlin.

AB  - Ukraine has enough biomass resources for biogas production. However, this energy potential is not used sufficiently. This research is aimed at examining the current experience of commercial biogas systems in the Europe Union and its adaptation for Ukraine. Special attention was paid to economic indicators, such as specific investment costs, production costs (biogas, biomethane, and electricity), and incentives. Using statistical data for the European Union and Ukraine, the biogas potential for Ukraine (based on European experience) was determined. The economic competitiveness of biogas production was evaluated compared to alternatives, such as photovoltaic, wind power, biomass, conventional fuels, and liquid biofuels. The results showed that biogas complexes have higher specific investment costs and produce more expensive electricity. It was highlighted that agricultural residues and industrial waste are sustainable feedstocks for biogas systems. A perspective biogas plant is a plant that is an integrated part of the circular bioeconomy that is based on organic residues. Biomethane production (as a substitution for vehicle fuel) combined with capture and utilization of carbon dioxide is a more profitable pathway. Awareness and perception of the importance of biogas are key factors for the development of the biogas industry. To develop an effective strategy for the biogas industry, it is necessary to create a positive image in order to raise awareness and knowledge of biogas technologies. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - This article presents results from a project involving local practitioners in the construction of scenarios for a regional energy and transport system. The purpose is to demonstrate how sustainability transitions research can interact with local practice by means of socio-technical scenarios. Combining quantitative data with qualitative storylines, the article presents four scenarios, which describe different ways of using biogas, biodiesel and electricity in four different applications: city buses, inter-city buses, heavy-duty trucks and industrial processes. The article compares the four scenarios in terms of realization possibilities, energy efficiency and greenhouse gas reduction. Focusing on near-term realization on a commercial basis, the research findings suggest that collaborative scenario construction can be a useful strategy to manage conflicting agendas and engage key stakeholders in dialogues on transition pathways. The article concludes by presenting policy lessons for practice-oriented transition management. The lessons point to the importance of flexibility in system delineations, the critical timing of near-term scenarios, and the use of scenarios to outline local practitioners' agency. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Waste cooking oil (WCO) is generally collected from different sources, e.g., restaurants as an economic feedstock for biodiesel production. The variations of the quality of the collected oil can create uncertainty in the components of the WCO processed in the biodiesel production process. Therefore, the optimal synthesis of an alkali-catalyzed process considering the uncertainty in the WCO components was studied. The uncertain quality of the WCO feed was modeled using a Gaussian random variable. Then, a stochastic optimization approach was proposed for the design of the plant and a chance-constrained based methodology was adopted as the solution technique of the problem. The effects of the proposed approach on the design and operating parameters were studied. It was shown that the stochastic formulation can provide a safety margin to be able to tolerate the feed quality variations. The economic performance of the plant designed using different scenarios was also compared. It was shown that a plant designed using the proposed stochastic approach has 11.9% extra fixed capital investment and revenue as high as the nominal case. The proposed design can handle a range of feed qualities without major constraint violation which was not the case for designs obtained using deterministic formulation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Algal biofuels are of growing interest in the quest to reduce carbon emissions in the atmosphere but the sensitivity of the fuel production to various factors is not well understood. Therefore, the effects of temperature, light intensity, carbon concentration, aeration rate, pH, and time on the CO2 biofixation rate of Chlorella vulgaris (ISC-23) were investigated using experimental, and Genetic Programming (GP) modeling techniques. The impacts of applying the cement industrial flue gas as a source of carbon, useful for the growth of microalgae, were also studied. Chlorella vulgaris (ISC-23) was cultivated in a laboratory photobioreactor on a BG-11 medium. The developed GP model was used to optimize the CO2 biofixation based on the studied variables and produce a predictive equation. By using statistical measurements and error analysis, the predictive equation was shown to agree with the experimentally obtained values. It was found that the optimum conditions occur at 26o C, and 3200 lx of light, in the existence of CO2. Applying 6% CO2 as the input with the aeration rate of 0.5 vvm in 11 days was also reported as the optimum scenario for algae production with keeping the pH close to 7.5. The results indicate that the predictions determined with the proposed equation can be of practical worth for researchers and experts in the biofuel industry. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Soil pollution is growing at an alarming rate in today's industrialized world as a result of increasing anthropogenic activities, either intentional (e.g., use of fertilizers and pesticides, irrigation with untreated wastewater, or land application of sewage sludge) or accidental (e.g., oil spills or leaching from landfills). Terrestrial soil pollution from transportation fuels such as Diesel or Biodiesel is inevitable as they are part of life's necessities. Biodiesel is considered an environmental friendly fuel due to its non-hydrocarbon composition and low particulate matter emission. However, there are still some controversies regarding biodiesel environmental toxicity to terrestrial life. Little is known about the ecotoxicity of plant-based biodiesels to soil organisms. In the present study, three ecotoxicological tests including an earthworm (Eisenia fetida) 14-day soil toxicity test, a filter paper contact toxicity test, and a cocoon hatchability test were performed to examine the toxic effects of three plant-based biodiesels - safflower methyl ester (SaME), castor methyl ester (CME), and castor ethyl ester (CEE), with Diesel fuel. Unlike Diesel, the biodiesels were less toxic based on low earthworm mortality in the soil toxicity test. However significant morbidity responses (e.g., weight loss, coiling, posterior and anterior fragmentation, and excessive discharge of coelomic fluid) were observed in earthworms exposed to biodiesel. Further, in the cocoon hatchability test, biodiesels were equally toxic to Diesel at 2% and 5% soil concentrations, with no hatching success. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present study, Terminalia bellirica methyl ester (TBME)/biodiesel was formed using potassium hydroxide as catalyst. Methyl ester fuel properties were resolved as per ASTM standard. The attribute of compression ignition (CI) engine such as combustion, performance, and released emission qualities of samples, such as diesel and TBME blends (B10, B20, B30, B50, and B100), were deliberated on a single-cylinder CI engine. By varying the load to 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%, test data were measured. Using AVL DI GAS 444N (five gas) analyzer dissimilarity in the engine emissions were documented. The results of biodiesel test blends show the similar combustion and performance to diesel curves with minor decrement. However, CO and HC emission diminish when engine fueled with TBME test blends whereas NOx amplifies. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This paper presents results of a simulation study on the performance and emission characteristics of a direct injection compression ignition engine, fuelled with butanol/diesel blend (20% of butanol-by volume, called as Bu20). The aim of this study is identify optimum values of the engine operating parameters for this Bu20 fuel, which give the best performance with minimum emissions. CONVERGE CFD software was used to carry-out the simulation studies. Simulation studies were carried out by varying four operating parameters of the engine, viz., compression ratio (CR) (16.5, 17.5, and 18.5), fuel injection pressure (FIP) (200, 220, and 240 bar), start of injection (SOI) (21, 23, and 25° CA bTDC) and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) (0, 10, and 20%). The engine performance was evaluated in terms of indicated specific fuel consumption (ISFC), soot and oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Response surface methodology was employed for developing response models for the three output parameters considered, that is, ISFC, NOx, and soot. From the analysis of variance, it was observed that all the developed response models were statistically significant. Desirability approach was used to find the optimum combination of the input parameters with an objective of minimizing the three output responses that is, ISFC, NOx, and soot. The analysis showed that engine operation with optimum values of the operating parameters, that is, CR of 17.5, FIP of 240 bar, SOI of 25° CA bTDC and EGR rate of 10% would give better performance with minimum emissions for Bu20 fuel, compared to the engine performance with baseline configuration. © 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - The major challenge in the synthesis of high-density biofuels is to identify the bio-based source for C-C cyclic compounds and C-C coupling reactions with a suitable selectivity. Herein, we selectively synthesize 1,2,4-benzenetriol (BTO) with a yield of 51.4% from cellulose-derived 5-hydromethylfurfural via a ring-rearrangement reaction. The cellulose-derived route is a more meaningful route for the C-C cyclic compounds compared to the traditional hemicellulose- and lignin-derived routes. Furthermore, BTO is very easily dimerized via a C-C oxidative coupling reaction, showing a yield of 94.4% and selectivity of nearly 100% under environmentally friendly reaction conditions. After hydrodeoxygenation, bicyclohexane is obtained with a yield of 87.4%. This work not only provides a promising route to produce C-C cyclic fine compounds based on a cellulose-derived route, but also shows a highly efficient synthesis route for high-density biofuels via the C-C oxidative coupling reaction.

AB  - Marine pollution is a major concern but one that has to date been largely overlooked; thus, for example, it was not accounted for in the Paris agreement on climate change. Maritime fuel combustion currently contributes 3% of the annual global greenhouse gas emissions. Nearly all shipping-related emissions occur within 400 km of land and cause death and morbidity to millions of people. The initial greenhouse gas strategy on the reduction of carbon emissions to at least half of its 2008 levels by 2050, adopted by the International Maritime Organization, has the potential to spur innovations and alternative fuel, enabling the shipping industry to adapt to future challenges. Some zero-emission options such as the use of hydrogen and biofuels are considered potential strategies, but they lack the infrastructure capacity needed to meet the world's shipping demand. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) has gained substantial interest as a marine fuel because it can comply with the strictest environmental regulations currently in force, and it is often regarded as a future fuel as most newly constructed ships are built to run on it. Although the use of LNG leads to lower CO2 emissions compared to traditional heavy fuel oils (HFOs), there is still a need to consider further reduction. A solution which can be implemented is the use of an onboard capture system on ships, also known as ship-based carbon capture. In this study, a process and economic evaluation was carried out on a solvent-based postcombustion capture process for the energy system of a CO2 carrier. A rate-based model was developed, validated, and scaled up to process the flue gas from a Wartsila 9L46 DF marine diesel engine. Different modes of operation with respect to engine load and capture rate were analyzed in this study, and the capture cost was estimated. The cost of CO2 capture was used as an economic index for this study. It was observed via a sensitivity analysis that, at 90% capture rate, the cost of capture was at least $117/t. The effect of exhaust gas recycling was also explored, and this resulted in a considerable reduction in the capture cost. The exhaust gas waste heat was utilized and was adequate to supply the required energy needed by the reboiler at each capture rate examined. Also, for LNG-fueled CO2 ships, the cold energy obtained while converting the LNG to gas was utilized to liquefy the captured CO2 from the flue gas. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biogas is a renewable biofuel that contains a lot of CH4 and CO2. Biogas can be used to produce heat and electric power while reducing CH4, one of greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, it has been getting increasing academic attention. There are some application ways of biogas; biogas can produce hydrogen to feed a fuel cell by reforming process. Urea is also a hydrogen carrier and could produce hydrogen by steam reforming. This study then employes steam reforming of biogas and compares hydrogen-rich syngas production and carbon dioxide with various methane concentrations using steam and aqueous urea solution (AUS) by Thermodynamic analysis. The results show that the utilization of AUS as a replacement for steam enriches the production of H2 and CO and has a slight CO2 rise compared with pure biogas steam reforming at a temperature higher than 800 °C. However, CO2 formation is less than the initial CO2 in biogas. At the reaction temperature of 700 °C, carbon formation does not occur in the reforming process for steam/biogas ratios higher than 2. These conditions led to the highest H2, CO production, and reforming efficiency (about 125%). The results can be used as operation data for systems that combine biogas reforming and applied to solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), which usually operates between 700 °C to 900 °C to generate electric power in the future. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - This study details an investigation of the performance and emission characteristics of a Ford XLD 418 compression ignition engine fuelled by various biodiesel/standard agricultural diesel blends. Blend ratios of 10, 50 and 75% were tested and compared with baseline tests performed using pure diesel fuel in the same engine and under the same nominal test conditions. All experiments were carried out in a controlled laboratory environment in accordance with the British Standard, International Organization for Standardization (BS ISO) 15550 standard for compression ignition engines. Numerous full engine performance tests and emission analyses were carried out for each blend, and it is concluded that the engine mechanical performance became marginally worse with increased fuel blend ratio levels. In terms of exhaust gas analysis, emission gas levels for NOx showed a definitive increase, whereas others such as CO and HC generally decreased. CO2 did not show a conclusive trend when regarded in the context of the variation associated with the baseline pure diesel tests, although the literature supports that it increases marginally. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Ethyl furfuryl ether (EFE) considered as potential biofuel can replace petroleum diesel up to 100%. EFE also has efficient blending properties with biodiesel to improve its cold flow properties. Herein we demonstrate efficient synthesis of EFE by etherification of renewable furfuryl alcohol (FAlc) with ethanol over heterogenized heteropoly acids. Cs-exchanged heterogenized heteropoly acid (H3−xCsxPW12O40, x = 0.5, 1, 2, 2.5) was prepared using ion exchange method. The H3−xCsxPW12O40 catalysts were well characterized by the XRD, BET, XPS, NH3-TPAD and pyridine IR. The etherification of renewable FAlc with ethanol over H3−xCsxPW12O40; H1Cs2PW12O40 catalyst having moderate acidity of 786 µmol/g; and B/L of 3.6 have shown 65% EFE yield and low humin formation with after 98% FAlc conversion and catalyst was observed to be reusable for four cycles (fresh + 3 recycles). © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Surfactant-aided dispersed air flotation was investigated as a low cost microalgae harvesting technique for biodiesel, using the microalgae Chlorella saccharophila and the surfactant CTAB (cetyl trimethylammonium bromide). Response Surface Methodology (Box-Behnken design) was used for optimization of both recovery and concentration factor. The effects of CTAB concentration, column height, pH and air flow rate were investigated. The measured responses were initially analyzed separately to obtain models for each response variable. It was determined that only CTAB concentration and flow rate were significant for the recovery, while all tested variables were significant for the concentration factor. Next, optimization was performed to maximize both responses (recovery and concentration factor) simultaneously. The overall optimum processing parameters determined were CTAB concentration of 100 mg L−1, a column height of 795 mm, pH of 10 and flow rate of 57.9 mL min−1. The expected values for recovery and concentration factor were 91.1% ± 1.62% and 17.9 ± 6.19, respectively. Experimental testing resulted in a recovery of 94.5 ± 2.7% and a concentration factor of 13.23 ± 0.98, which indicates that the experimental values agree with the predicted by 96% and 74% for recovery and concentration factor, respectively. This study demonstrates that surfactant-aided dispersed air flotation is a promising harvesting technique for microalgae biodiesel production processes as its energy requirement is low, can achieve high recoveries and substantially decreases the working volume of microalgae culture. However, a secondary dewatering step is recommended for further concentration prior to product conversion. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Global political economists have highlighted how states and corporations enact environmentally destructive practices and create commodities that legitimate those same activities. Linking macroeconomic systems to situated micropractices, how a by-product of US ethanol production, distillers’ grains, has been transformed into a global animal feed commodity is explored in this study. The effect of this transformation is to legitimate both biofuel production and intensive livestock operations, while delegitimating the resistant ‘food vs. fuel’ argument proposed by critics of biofuel production. Yet the process of creating an animal feed commodity from industrial waste is also problematic, characterized by the creation of multiple ‘frictions of consumption’, concerning the product’s storability, flowability and digestibility. Bioscience experts work to overcome these frictions; yet these frictions may also offer opportunities for those seeking to resist these environmentally destructive industries. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The utilization of polymeric biorenewables for the synthesis of biofuels and essential chemicals is largely obstructed by their recalcitrant structures and complex product distribution. Here, hydrosilane-mediated hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of the furanic mixture 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and 5-chloromethylfurfural (CMF), directly derived from cellulosic biomass, can be enabled by heterogeneous Pd-catalyzed dechlorination to exclusively give the biofuel 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) in a high overall yield of 72%. Kinetic and isotope labeling studies supported by computational calculations explicitly elucidate the reaction pathways. The initial dechlorination of CMF into acidic species promotes the rapid in situ formation of relatively stable acetalized and etherified furanic intermediates, which not only greatly accelerate the reactivity of the entire HDO process (TOF: up to 1200 h-1), but are also able to significantly get rid of unwanted side reactions. Importantly, this catalytic system can also be applied for the upgrade of various chlorinated carboxides to produce ortho-, meta- and para-substituted arenes with satisfactory yields of 82-99% at 25-45 °C, and the used commercial Pd/C catalyst is highly recyclable.

AB  - Plasma-assisted catalytic cracking is an attractive method for producing biofuels from vegetable oil. This paper studied the effect of reactor temperature on the performance of plasma-assisted catalytic cracking of palm oil into biofuels. The cracking process was conducted in a Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD)-type plasma reactor with the presence of spent RFCC catalyst. The reactor temperature was varied at 400, 450, and 500 ºC. The liquid fuel product was analyzed using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to determine the compositions. Result showed that the presence of plasma and catalytic role can enhance the reactor performance so that the selectivity of the short-chain hydrocarbon produced increases. The selectivity of gasoline, kerosene, and diesel range fuels over the plasma-catalytic reactor were 16.43%, 52.74% and 21.25%, respectively, while the selectivity of gasoline, kerosene and diesel range fuels over a conventional fixed bed reactor was 12.07%, 39.07%, and 45.11%, respectively. The increasing reactor temperature led to enhanced catalytic role of cracking reaction, particularly directing the reaction to the shorter hydrocarbon range. The reactor temperature dependence on the liquid product components distribution over the plasma-catalytic reactor was also studied. The aromatic and oxygenated compounds increased with the reactor temperature. ©2020. CBIORE-IJRED. All rights reserved. © CBIORE-IJRED. All rights reserved.

AB  - In charged spark-ignition engines, additional water injection allows for the reduction of temperature under stoichiometric mixture conditions. However, a higher complexity of the injection and combustion processes is introduced when a mixture of fuel and water (“emulsion”) is injected directly into the combustion chamber using the same injector. For this purpose, the mixture must be homogenized before injection so that a reproducible composition can be adjusted. In principle, gasoline and water are not miscible, and may form an unstable macro-emulsion during mixing. However, the addition of ethanol, which is a biofuel component that is admixed to gasoline, can improve the mixing and may lead to a stable micro-emulsion. For the assessment of the distribution of the water and fuel phases in the mixture, a novel imaging concept based on laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) is proposed. In a first spectroscopic study, a fluorescence dye for imaging of the water phase is selected and evaluated. The fluorescence spectra of the dye dissolved in pure water are investigated under varied conditions using a simplified pressure cell equipped with a stirrer. The study comprises effects of temperature, dye concentration, and photo-dissociation on fluorescence signals. In a second step, fuel is mixed with water (5 vol. % to 10 vol. %) containing the dye, and the water dispersion in the fuel is investigated in an imaging study. Additionally, the miscibility of fuel and water is studied for varying ethanol content, and the homogeneity of the mixture is determined. These first investigations are also essential for the assessment of the potential of the LIF technique for studying the distribution of the water phase in internal combustion engine injection systems and sprays. © 2020 Optical Society of America.

AB  - Recently, the production of sustainable biofuels from algal biomass has gained significant attention and been investigated as a potential replacement of fossil fuel. However, existing downstream processes for producing biodiesel from algae cells are complex, highly energy-intensive, and have high economic and environmental cost. Therefore, this work introduces an alternative and novel method of utilizing the energy content of microalgae that precludes lipid extraction by aspirating wet algal biomass suspensions directly into the intake air of an internal combustion engine. For all engine experiments, powdered algae cells were prepared as slurries at different biomass concentrations. The impacts of (i) varying the biomass concentration with constant suspension injection flowrate into the engine intake and (ii) varying suspension injection flowrate with constant biomass concentration were investigated. A correlation between engine work produced during combustion and algal biomass aspiration was found. At constant flowrate and greater than 5% biomass concentrations, an increase of energy release during combustion from the aspirated algae could be observed. However, the aspiration of low concentration biomass suspension produced a negative impact on engine performance relative to water-only aspiration. The engine exhaust gas of nitrogen oxides (NOx) was reduced for all algae suspension tests relative to diesel-only combustion. However, the carbon monoxide (CO) emission level was much higher relative to diesel-only tests at high biomass concentrations and injection flowrate. These findings demonstrate the possibility of utilising the energy content of algal biomass in combustion without lipid extraction, with added benefits of reducing NOx emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present investigation ascertains the impact of gradient concentrations of sodium nitrate on the physiology and biochemical composition of isolated microalga Scenedesmus rotundus-MG910488. The concentrations of nitrate were selected as 0, 3.5, 7.0, 10.5, 14.0, and 17.6 mM/L in BG11 medium. The lower concentrations of nitrogen were found to be significantly decreasing the cell count and photosynthetic activity in the microalga as well as changing cell morphology. The amount of biomass, its productivity and lipid yield were significantly affected. The highest biomass of 689.15 ± 14.27 mg/L was achieved in the concentration of 17.6 mM/L with the biomass productivity of 38.28 ± 0.78 mg/L. The highest lipid accumulation of 41.46 ± 1.94% dry-cell weight was obtained at a concentration of 3.5 mM/L, whereas the lowest lipid accumulation of 29.22 ± 1.65% at the concentration of 17.6 mM/L sodium nitrate. The fatty acid composition determines the quality of the fuel, so the characterization of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) was performed by GC, and the assessment of methyl esters of fatty acid confirmed the existence of palmitic acid, oleic acid, and linoleic acid, which are essential components suitable for biodiesel production. FTIR confirms the presence of FAME components by estimating the bending and stretching of functional groups. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - The aim of present work is to improve the efficiency and reduce the harmful exhaust emissions from diesel engines. Neat lemongrass oil was selected as a biofuel, and its physical and chemical properties based on ASTM standards were investigated. The combustion unit was coated with yttria-stabilized zirconia as a ceramic layering material. The initiative behind the thermal barrier coating was to acquire reduced heat losses by ceramic layering the combustion unit with the substance having reduced thermal conductivity, so as to aid in the transformation of accrued heat transformation into constructive work. Conventional diesel fuel was taken as a baseline fuel and investigated in the uncoated engine. Then, the coated combustion unit was installed in the engine and investigated with diesel. Subsequently, lemongrass biofuel was used as operating energy in both coated and normal conditions. Ceramic-layered conditions exhibited high engine efficiency with reduced fuel utilization. The result showed that the coated engine exhibited reduced emissions like smoke, HC and CO with the exception of NOx compared to normal engine. This variation was observed owing to trapping of energy inside the combustion unit and low level of energy transferred to the combustion chamber walls.

AB  - In rural India, unpleasant atmosphere, anthropogenic gas emission, air and soil pollution are caused due to disposal of livestock's wastes (cow dung and chicken waste) in open environment. This study provides zero emission concept for waste disposal and value addition of these wastes for renewable green energy production. In this study, biogas production was carried out with varying proportion of cow dung to chicken waste (1:0, 0:1, 1:1, 2:1, 1:2, 3:1 and 1:3) for duration of 40 days. Chlorella pyrenoidosa was cultivated from digestate water and used as co-substrate in digester in varying proportions (2:1:1, 2:1:2 and 2:1:3) to study its role on biogas distribution. The effect of pH, feedstock ratio, time and C/N ratio for biogas production were evaluated. The maximum methane and hydrogen yield was 68% (30th day) and 29% (10th day) for 2:1:2 ratio respectively. The slurry possessed nitrogen (1.7%), phosphate (0.8%) and potassium (0.4%) respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recycling of waste material and production of biofuels are the thrust areas to modern technology. The basic idea behind this work is to regenerate waste silver from X-ray films and to employ them in biofuel production from jatropha oil. Stable silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) were prepared using Quercus infectoria (oak gall) and raw Camellia sinensis (tea) extracts. The synthesized materials were characterized by XRD, UV-visible spectra, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, and Fe-SEM technique. The temperature of the reactions, weight hourly space velocity, and time of reaction decide the yield of biofuel, and the parameters were optimized over Ag NP catalyst. Apart from yield of biofuel, the proportion of gasoline fraction (C5-C9) was also peer monitored. A maximum of 90% conversion of jatropha oil was converted into 85% biofuel with 76% selectivity toward gasoline over Ag NPs. Flash point, fire point, calorific value, cloud point, specific gravity, and viscosity of the gasoline were evaluated and correlated with ASTM D6751 standards. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - The synthesis and characterization of Ni-NH2/Mesoporous Silica (MS) catalysts from Lapindo mud for the hydrocracking of waste cooking oil into biofuel has been conducted. The MS was synthesized by the hydrothermal method using CTAB as a template. The functionalization of –NH2 into MS was carried out by the grafting method. The Ni metal was loaded into NH2/MS by wet impregnation. The catalytic activity test was done for hydrocracking of waste cooking oil by using the MS, NH2/MS, and Ni-NH2/MS catalysts. The results of the liquid product of the hydrocracking were analyzed by the gravimetric method and GC-MS. The experimental result showed that the liquid products of the hydrocracking using MS, NH2/MS, and Ni-NH2/MS catalysts were 63.95, 70.32, and 66.44 wt.%. The highest selectivity of the gasoline fraction (34.98 wt.%) was produced by the NH2/MS catalyst and the highest diesel oil fraction (1.52 wt.%) was produced by MS. The NH2/MS catalyst was successfully used as a catalyst in the hydrocracking of waste cooking oil into the hydrocarbons (biofuel). © RASĀYAN. All rights reserved.

AB  - Camelina can be considered a valuable crop for bio-based products and biofuels, but, to date, there are still many uninvestigated aspects concerning the optimization of its agricultural management and its environmental impact. Consequently, a low-input camelina cultivation has been realized, in northern Italy environment, through a 4-year camelina-wheat rotation in open field. In these conditions, camelina was grown as winter crop. Camelina reached, over the years, a variable (CV=28%) mean seed yield of 0.82 Mg ha-1. This notwithstanding, the oil content - 39.17% (CV=3%) - and its related quality were rather stable, reaching an oil yield of 320 kg ha-1 particularly rich in omega-3 fatty acids. The low input cultivation system here adopted implied an energy ratio (output energy/input energy) of 4 and a 30% decrease in Global Warming Potential per hectare, compared to the standard value reported by the European Renewable Energy Directive for sunflower, reducing, at the same time, other relevant environmental burdens. However, due to its relatively low oil production, the full use of all camelina co-products should be considered in order to fulfil the sustainability requirements for European jet fuel production. In fact, stability of yields and quality of oil, oilcake and straws makes low-input camelina eligible for many other novel green chemistry applications. © the Author(s), 2020.

AB  - The economic feasibility of growing Nannochloropsis sp. at the commercial scale was evaluated for the production of biodiesel and co-products. A local isolate of Nannochoropsis was grown in (6) 200-L raceway ponds at Alexandria University wherein cultures reached maximum cell concentrations ~ 4–6 × 107 cells/mL (0.63–0.88 g/L dry weight) and a peak biomass productivity of 0.09 g/L/day during mid- to late-log growth. Areal productivity was estimated at 17.65 g/m2/day when ponds were operated on a semi-batch schedule, harvesting 50% every 2 days and recycling 60% of the media. Areal productivity was estimated around 10.3 g/m2/day for batch schedules. Late-log cultures harvested from all ponds yielded 10 kg of wet algal paste, which was reduced to 1.05 kg of dried algal powder. The biomass was composed of valuable co-products approx. 14.0% carbohydrate, 37.3% protein, 0.01% chlorophyll-a, and 0.02% carotenoids (w/w). Total lipid made up 38% of the biomass (w/w); 34% of the biomass was determined to be neutral lipid which are transesterified to biodiesel and 4% are polar lipid. Fatty acids from glycerolipids were quantified by gas chromatography-flame-ionization detector (GC-FID) as fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) revealing carbon-chain lengths from C6 to C22. A preliminary economic evaluation was conducted to determine the feasibility of constructing commercial-scale algae biodiesel production facilities in Egypt. The return on investment (ROI) of the current economic feasibility study for biofuel production alone was 22% after considering the market prices of the biodiesel, cake, and glycerol by-products. Based on this assessment, additional high-value products are needed to improve the ROI. Noting that the valuable co-products are considered as added cost in the biomass left after biodiesel production. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Synthesis of Co-NH2/mesoporous silica bifunctional catalyst for conversion of used cooking oil into biofuel was carried out. Synthesis of mesoporous silica (MS) was done by the hydrothermal method using silica from Sidoarjo mud and gelatin from bovine bone as a template. Weight ratio variation of silica/gelatin was 4, 6, and 8 produced MS4, MS6, and MS8 respectively characterized by FTIR. The MS with minimum gelatin content after calcination (MS8) was identified using FTIR, TEM, and SAA. The impregnation of Co into the MS8 was done by the wet impregnation method and the Co/MS8 catalyst was analyzed using XRF and acidity test with NH3 vapor adsorption. Functionalization of NH2 into the MS8 and Co/MS8 was done by the grafting method and the products were characterized using FTIR. The catalytic activity test in used cooking oil hydrocracking was done by thermal (without catalyst), physical mixture of Co/MS8 and NH2/MS8 catalyst, and Co-NH2/MS8 bifunctional catalyst. The hydrocracking liquid products were investigated by GC-MS. The MS8 had a specific surface area of 666.76 m2 g-1, a pore diameter of 4.9 nm, and a pore volume of 0.46 cm3 g-1. The Co-NH2/MS8 bifunctional catalyst produced the highest liquid product of 97.62 wt.% in the hydrocracking of used cooking oil with selectivity for gasoline and diesel fraction of 3.02 and 46.86 wt.%. © RASĀYAN.

AB  - Microbial lipids have been considered as promising resources for the production of renewable biofuels and oleochemicals. Various feedstocks, including sugars, crude glycerol, and volatile fatty acids, have been used as substrates for microbial lipid production, yet amino acid (AA) wastes remain to be evaluated. Here, we describe the potential to use AA wastes for lipid production with a two-stage culture mode by an oleaginous yeast strain Rhodosporidium toruloides CGMCC 2.1389. Each of the 20 proteinogenic AAs was evaluated individually as sole carbon source, with 8 showing capability to facilitate cellular lipid contents of more than 20%. It was found that L-proline was the most favored AA, with which cells accumulated lipids to a cellular lipid content of 37.3%. When blends with AA profiles corresponding to those of meat industry by-products and sheep viscera were used, the cellular lipid contents reached 27.0% and 28.7%, respectively. The fatty acid compositional analysis of these lipid products revealed similar profiles to those of vegetable oils. These results, thus, demonstrate a potential route to convert AA wastes into lipids, which is of great importance for waste management and biofuel production. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - With the Renewable Energy Directive 2018/2001 (RED II), adopted in December 2018, the EU is continuing the political framework for the use of renewable energy sources in the transport sector for the period from 2021 to 2030. At the same time, the German federal government has set a target of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the transport sector by at least 40% to 42% by 2030 compared to the 1990 GHG level. To investigate the possible effects of the European and national requirements on the German GHG quota, cost-optimal fuel mixes were modelled to achieve the GHG targets of 26 fuel options in each of the nine different scenarios. The results show clear differences between the scenarios that implement the RED II targets (including 14% renewables in transport by 2030) and those that implement the climate protection target (40%-42% GHG reduction compared to 1990 by 2030). If only the minimum requirements of RED II are met, the German climate protection target is clearly missed without further measures. In order to achieve the climate protection target, a significant reduction in the final energy consumption in transport is required, as well as a very high GHG quota of 34.5%, meaning a high proportion of renewables of ca. 40% and using almost all the fuel options considered. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - This paper presents the results of the investigations carried on a common rail direct injection (CRDI) diesel engine using algae biofuel–diesel blends. The algae biofuel–diesel blends considered were B10 and B15 (10% and 15% of algae biofuel are mixed with diesel on volumetric basis). The tests were conducted on CRDI diesel engine operated at a constant speed of 1500 rpm by varying the fuel injection pressure (FIP) from 600 to 1050 bar in steps of 150 bar. The results demonstrate that at high fuel injection pressure, i.e. 1050 bar, brake thermal efficiency (BTE) is highest and brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) is lowest when compared to other injection pressures. CO and HC emissions and smoke density significantly decreased with increase in injection pressures. However, NOx emissions are shown to be increased. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Three different waste animal fats (bone, chicken, and tallow) have been studied to evaluate whether they could be used as bioliquids according to the European Regulation (EC) No.1069/2009. The analyses showed that they contained an unsuitable amount of free fatty acids (FFA) and impurities content (total sediment) if compared with the standards for power generation (set by UNI 6579:2009), with the exception of tallow fat (class C, UNI/TS 11163:2018). A series of physical-chemical processes already applied at industrial scale have been considered to manage the acid value and the impurities content. The FFA esterification was carried out with methanol, comparing two acid catalysts (sulfuric acid or Amberlyst – 15), followed by neutralization of the residual acidity with two different bases (ammonia solution or solid sodium carbonate monohydrate) when necessary. The final purification has been achieved by treatment with powdered activated carbon. In particular, the bone fat was studied as reference material, having the worst initial physical-chemical characteristics. The UNI/TS 11163:2018 standard would allow to classify the bioliquid from bone fat belonging to class B, while the one from chicken would require further degumming and purification processes to reduce the metals, sulfur, and phosphorus content. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The rapid decarbonisation of transportation is critical if global efforts to mitigate the worst possible impacts of anthropogenic climate change are to be successful. Transportation is a leading sectoral contributor of greenhouse gas emissions, and demand for transportation continues to grow globally. Alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) powered by fuels such as electricity, hydrogen, and biofuels promise to mitigate the environmental impacts of automotive transportation, including urban air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. However, multiple barriers to AFV diffusion exist, including low consumer acceptance, high vehicle costs, and a lack of refuelling infrastructure, meaning that sophisticated policies and strategies will be needed to achieve an AFV market transition that is both ecologically and economically sustainable. While more EVs were sold in 2018 than ever before, these sales were the result of aggressive policy support in places such as China and Norway, and it is not clear that EV sales would persist at this level if these policies were removed. In this paper, we present and make freely available a generalised model of AFV diffusion that is flexible for the exploration of these critical policy questions, building on recent AFV diffusion literature from system dynamics and related fields. We demonstrate using illustrative scenarios the fragility of AFV diffusion, with a range of behaviour modes possible depending on the structure of the market and the actions of stakeholders. Finally, we identify a number of contemporary research topics of interest to automotive manufacturers and policymakers that can be addressed using the model. © Operational Research Society 2020.

AB  - We develop an analytical and numerical model that integrates land, fuel, and food markets to evaluate the welfare implications of the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). Each dollar reduction in the external costs of oil dependency comes at the expense of additional environmental external costs of $0.53. Conditional on the categories of external benefits we consider, the RFS fails a benefit–cost test when excluding the change in the trade balance, with net costs totaling $1.4 billion in 2015. Further, policymakers would have to value the external costs of oil dependency at $1.05 per gallon of gasoline in order for the RFS to pass a benefit–cost test, which is nearly five times larger than central estimates of the oil premium. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Road transport is one of the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions due to the current dependence on fossil fuels such as diesel and gasoline. This situation needs to be changed through the retirement of fossil fuels and the implementation of alternative fuels and vehicles such as biofuels, battery electric vehicles, and fuel cell electric vehicles fuelled by hydrogen. Nevertheless, the environmental suitability of alternative fuels is conditioned by how they are produced. Through the case study of Spain, this article prospectively assesses – from a techno-economic and carbon footprint perspective– the production technology mix of alternative fuels from 2020 to 2050. The proposed energy systems optimisation model includes a large number of production technologies regarding biofuels (bioethanol, biodiesel, synthetic diesel/gasoline, and hydrotreated vegetable oil), electricity, and hydrogen. The combined study of these fuels provides a relevant framework to discuss the targets established for the road transport sector with a high level of detail not only regarding fuel type but also technology breakdown. The results show the relevance of second-generation biofuel production technologies in fulfilling the future biofuel demand. Regarding the extra electricity demand associated with the penetration of electric vehicles, the results suggest a key role of wind- and solar-based technologies in meeting such a need. Concerning hydrogen as an option to decarbonise the transport system, even though steam methane reforming is the most mature and cost-competitive production technology, hydrogen production would be satisfied through electrolysis in order to avoid relying on fossil resources as the main feedstock. Overall, this integrated approach to the long-term production technology mix of alternative fuels for road transport is expected to be relevant to a wide range of decision-makers willing to prospectively assess road transport systems from a technology perspective. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work five biorefinery scenarios are proposed for the production of five different target products. Two of these scenarios included biodiesel production from Scenedesmus dimorphus microalgae biomass and glycerol valorization through bioconversion into dihydroxyacetone (DHA) with the bacteria Gluconobacter oxydans. Experimental data of microalgae biomass composition were used as inputs to simulate reactive distillation column (RD) and continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) for microalgae oil transesterification stage. Optimum methanol/microalgae oil molar feed ratio, catalyst mass and reflux ratio were determined from simulated conditions with the Aspen Plus® V.10.0 Software. The biorefinery with the best economic performance integrated RD and glycerol valorization processes and achieved an internal rate of return (IRR) of 19.8%. The results showed that the combined use of reactive distillation (RD) with the biological oxidation of glycerol into DHA allows economically feasible biorefinery schemes using Scenedesmus dimorphus microalgae biomass as a feedstock. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The Arecaceae family is widely distributed and comprises about 2600 species, in which 48 of them are native to Brazil and occurs in transition biomes between the Amazon, Cerrado and Caatinga. In addition to being used as a source of food and subsistence, they are also rich in lipophilic bioactive compounds, mainly carotenoids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, tocopherols and vitamin A. Moreover, they have considerable content of phenolic compounds, fibers and minerals. Therefore, the objective of this review is to present the physical-chemical and nutritional aspects, the main bioactive compounds, the biological properties and the innovative potential of four Brazilian palm-tree fruits of the Arecaceae family. Due to the presence of bioactive compounds, these fruits have the potential to promote health and can be used to prevent chronic non-communicable diseases, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and others. Furthermore, these raw materials and their by-products can be used in the development of new food, chemical, pharmaceutical and cosmetic products. To ensure better use of these crops, promote their commercial value, benefit family farming and contribute to the country's sustainable development, it is necessary to implement new cultivation, post-harvest and processing techniques. Investing in research to publicize their potential is equally important, mainly of the ones still little explored, such as the buritirana. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To overcome the mass transfer limit and saponification, acidic deep eutectic solvents (DESs) were prepared with p-Toluenesulfonic acid (p-TsOH) and quaternary ammonium salts with different carbon chains. The DESs acted as catalysts and reaction media for biodiesel production by transesterification of the cooked and waste vegetable oil. The DESs were characterized by 1H NMR, FT-IR and TG. In five DESs, TOAB/p-TsOH was found to enhance the direct contact between methanol and oil and have the highest catalytic activity due to its long carbon chain, which was chosen to further optimize. The suggested conditions given by the response surface methodology model were the reaction temperature of 70.5 °C, catalyst dosage of 24.6 wt%, and a molar ratio of 12.5, which reached the yield of 99.2%. Furthermore, the kinetic study of transesterification was studied and followed the pseudo-ﬁrst-order reaction mechanism. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The bio-waste slow pyrolysis process is assessed by four indicators to determine its energetic, exergetic, economic and environmental performance. The influence of the pyrolysis temperature (300–800 °C) on these parameters, but also on the biochar, bio-oil and gas production, is analysed. The biochar yield decreased 10.5% and the gas yield increased 17.2% between 300 and 800 °C. The bio-oil yield increased about 2.1% between 300 and 500 °C and decreased about 8% between 500 and 800 °C. Within the temperature range 300–800 °C, the H2, CO and CH4 molar fractions increased 51.4, 6.6 and 0.3%, respectively. CO2 content decreased about 58.3%. The exergy efficiency varied between 81.16 and 85.33% in this temperature range. The exergy-based economic factor revealed that 15.38–19.16% of the total cost was associated with the exergy destruction. The environmental impact was lower at higher temperatures. The recommended temperature range is 300–400 °C to produce biochar, and temperatures of over 700 °C to produce gas. When the interest focus is on the bio-oil, it is recommended to work close to 500 °C. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We report herein, Soybean oil was shaped to biodiesel using CaO as heterogeneous catalyst and acetone as cosolvent by employing transesterification reaction at room temperature. In order to prepare active CaO catalyst, waste snail shell was calcined at 800 °C. The prepared catalyst was characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, EDS, TGA, FTIR, XRF, CO2-TPD, XPS and BET. Biodiesel yield of 98% was achieved with the optimized reaction parameters such as acetone loading of 20 wt% of oil, reaction time of 2 h, catalyst loading of 3 wt% and oil to methanol molar ratio of 1/6. Catalyst can be reused up to 11th cycles. It was concluded from the results that this waste material derived heterogeneous catalyst can replace homogeneous catalyst. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study was designed to isolate microalgal species which can tolerate severe environmental stresses and can be used for wastewater treatment and biofuel generation. Three different microalgal strains (including Chlorella sorokiniana GEEL-01, Parachlorella kessleri GEEL-02, and Parachlorella kessleri GEEL-03) were isolated from a wastewater treatment plant and Waterwheel Park. The highest growth rate (1.61 OD680nm) was observed for C. sorokiniana GEEL-01 with highest removal of total nitrogen (1.5 mg L−1 day−1) and total phosphorus (1.82 mg L−1 day−1). The biocomponents of the isolated species ranged from 19.47–29.64%, 39.39–52.51%, and 15.08–22.75% for carbohydrate, protein, and lipid, respectively, based on the dry cell weight (DCW). The function groups in microalgal biocompounds were also confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared radiation (FT-IR) spectra, indicated their ability for biofuel generation. Ultimate and proximate analyses of C. sorokiniana GEEL-01 showed high carbon (54.24% DCW) and volatile content (92.69% DCW), compare to other strains. Moreover, it exhibited a significant accumulation of lipid with an increase in the fractions of saturated fatty acids (64.5%), and the major fatty acids were palmitic acid (11.17%), stearic acid (33.86%), oleic acid (9.84%), and linoleic acid (11.56%). Biodiesel derived from the major fatty acids had optimum engine efficiency properties including iodine value (77.34 g I2/100 g oil) and cetane number (54.83). Cultivation of C. sorokiniana GEEL-01 can serve as a dual function of biodiesel feedstock generation and nutrients removal. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Mesoporous structure is important to promote mass transport and active site utilization of zeolites when used in reactions involving bulky molecules. However, their conventional hydrothermal synthesis is energy and labor intensive, requiring high-pressure operation, and lengthy heating a huge amount of alkaline liquid. We successfully synthesized new mesoporous zeolites, Meso-ZSM-5, via solid-state crystallization of dry aluminosilicate nanogels. Neighbor developing nanocrystals further joint at edges, creating connected, inter-lattice mesoscale pathway in the finished single crystalline zeolites. Palladium was further loaded on these zeolites to form a bi-functional catalyst (Pd/Meso-ZSM-5). When used in the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of guaiacol, a major bio-oil compound with disappointing conversion and severe coking issue over many HDO catalysts, Pd/Meso-ZSM-5 exhibits superior guaiacol conversion and product distribution when compared with those supported on conventional microporous ZSM-5 counterparts. This is attributed to the improved diffusion and accessibility of active sites inside Meso-ZSM-5 with its unique hierarchically porous structure. Ring saturated hydrocarbons are largely produced at 200 °C when hydrogenation dominates while alkaylated aromatics become major HDO products as deoxygenation becomes favorable at 250 °C. These encouraging results may ignite the wide use of these mesoporous zeolites in many other reactions in both traditional fossil fuel and emerging renewable energy fields. © 2020

AB  - This work involved the utilization of a byproduct from the palm oil refining process as reaction feedstock in a solventless and hydrogen-free catalytic deoxygenation (DO) over NiO–ZnO catalyst in producing diesel-like hydrocarbons as advanced biofuels. The catalyst supporter was synthesized using coprecipitation methods to form highly crystalline meso-macrostructured ZnO particles. The catalyst support was wet-impregnated with different loadings (wt %) of NiO to prepare the NiO–ZnO catalyst. X-ray diffraction patterns verified the persistence of good crystallinity and phase purity of the support, with fine NiO crystallites of size 14–22 nm. Synthesized NiO–ZnO catalysts demonstrated Type IV isotherm with H3 hysteresis loop with mesoporous-macroporous properties. The Brønsted and Lewis acidic sites of NiO–ZnO offer a synergy effect between the active site and catalyst supporter. Both N2 adsorption isotherm and electron microscopy analysis revealed the increase of the crystallite size of the catalyst by increase the NiO loadings. The catalytic activity of the NiO–ZnO catalyst was tested in a semi-batch reactor at 350 °C for 2 h in N2 atmospheric. The oxygenated compounds of palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) have been successfully removed to form linear hydrocarbons as green diesel compounds. The synergistic effect between NiO and ZnO significantly enhanced the catalytic activity for substrate DO. The hydrocarbons product yield reached 83.4%, with a diesel range (C11–C17) selectivity of 86.0%. The green diesel, which contains diesel-range hydrocarbons, is suitable as an alternative fuel product for vehicle engine usage. It is possible to be upscaled and compatible with the existed petrochemical refinery facilities. Hence, this is a promising work could be an economic potential and give value added to the palm oil byproduct sectors. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hierarchical flower-shaped hollow MgO (f-MgO) spheres were synthesized through an ethylene-glycol-mediated polyol process via hydrothermal reactions. The structure of f-MgO originates from intermediate flower-shaped Mg glycolate through the Ostwald ripening process. The surface of f-MgO consists of uniform petal-like nanosheets that provide high surface area and excellent accessibility to catalytic sites. Also, the f-MgO microsphere can prevent aggregation and stacking problems of nanosheets and control a surface area for catalytic activity. The morphology and structure of f-MgO were investigated using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The density of basic catalytic sites was derived from CO2-temperature-programmed desorption measurements. The f-MgO exhibits a basic site density of 0.5134 mmol/g, which is much higher than that of commercial MgO (c-MgO, 0.0288 mmol/g). Experimental results for the fatty acid methyl ester revealed that the catalytic strength of f-MgO as a heterogeneous catalyst for biodiesel production is greater than that of c-MgO. The maximum biodiesel conversion efficiency of f-MgO from canola oil is 93.4%, which is greater than the value of 91.4% for c-MgO. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Experimental data and detailed numerical modelling are presented on the burning characteristics of a model gasoline/biofuel mixture consisting of n-heptane and iso-butanol. A droplet burning in an environment that minimises the influence of buoyant and forced convective flows in the standard atmosphere is used to promote one-dimensional gas transport to facilitate numerical modelling of the droplet burning process. The numerical model includes a detailed combustion kinetic mechanism, unsteady gas and liquid transport, multicomponent diffusion inside the droplet, variable properties, and non-luminous radiative heat transfer from the flame. The numerical simulation was validated by experimental measurements in the standard atmosphere which showed good agreement with the evolutions of droplet and flame diameters. The iso-butanol concentration had a strong effect on formation of particulates. Above ~20% (volume) iso-butanol, flame luminosity was significantly diminished anddecreased with increasing iso-butanol concentration, while CO2 emissions as a representative greenhouse gas were not strongly influenced by the iso-butanol loading. The soot shell was located near a 1350 K isotherm for concentrations up to 20% (volume) iso-butanol, suggesting this value as a possible soot inception temperature for the mixture droplet. The combustion rate decreased with increasing iso-butanol concentration which was attributed to iso-butanol's higher liquid density. No evidence of a low temperature burning regime, or of extinction, was found (in experiments and simulations) for the small droplet sizes investigated. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Crude bio-oil produced from fast pyrolysis of woody biomass was subjected to catalytic hydrodeoxygenation reaction with various metal catalysts (Ni/C, Ni/SBA-15, Ni/Al-SBA-15, NiMn/SBA-15, Pt/C) using for continuous-flow reaction system at 300 °C under H2 pressure. Gas, immiscible liquid phases (light oil and heavy oil), and char was obtained as the primary products. Heavy oil yield was in the range 27.9–42.3 wt%, while char production was 2.3–11.0 wt%, both less than the corresponding figures for batch processing. Hydrodeoxygenation enhanced the fuel properties of bio-oil, yielding higher HHV (32.8–38.0 MJ/kg) than bio-oil (15.7 MJ/kg) and heavy oil produced in a batch type reactor (24.4–34.5 MJ/kg). Additionally, Miscibility of crude bio-oil and upgraded heavy oils with gasoline and diesel were also evaluated with three emulsifiers (Span60, Brij58, or IGEPAL CO-520). Crude bio-oil was hardly emulsified, whereas upgraded heavy oil was well emulsified with Span60. Increasing Span60 concentration also enhance the miscibility of heavy oil and diesel. An emulsion of heavy oil and diesel was stable for 6 months, suggesting that the heavy oil produced might have potential use in blends with diesel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bio-E10 is short for the biofuel made up of 90% gasoline in volume and 10% bio-ethanol, which is the ethanol made from commercially-grown crops such as corn and wheat by the sugar fermentation process. In China, bio-E10 will be supplied nationwide from 2020 as an alternative to conventional gasoline, aiming at ensuring greater energy security and lowering the greenhouse gas emissions. In order to assess the impacts of the upcoming bio-E10 application on the ozone forming potential (OFP) of the emissions from in-use vehicles, this paper examined the carbonyls and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the evaporative and tailpipe emissions of three China-4 certified in-use vehicles fueled with a market-available gasoline and two match-blend bio-E10s, and calculated their OFPs using the Maximum Incremental Reactivity (MIR) method. The results revealed that for the evaporative emissions, the use of bio-E10s increased the carbonyl and VOC emissions released within the diurnal-loss stage by 8.5–17.6% and 11.1–78.6% respectively, but decreased the carbonyl and VOC emissions in the hot-soak stage by 47.4%–61.5% and 4.8%–20.6% respectively. Regarding the tailpipe emissions, in comparison to the gasoline baseline, burning bio-E10s increased the carbonyls by 15%–46% while reducing the VOCs by 37%–56% over the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). Reductions in the tailpipe OFPs up to 47.3% were seen with the application of the bio-E10s, however, there were no clear conclusions with respect to the evaporative OFPs, which varied from −15% to ＋25% compared to the gasoline baseline. Based on the test results and census data, the application of bio-E10 in China is shown to help remove part of ozone contamination from the in-use vehicle sector. © 2020

AB  - The co-combustion of fuel has substantial advantages when compared to normal combustion and it requires very little modification. In this perspective, ethanol supplement co-combustion with biodiesel is proposed. The co-combustion characteristics were studied by manifold induction of vaporized ethanol and direct injection of waste cooking oil biodiesel. A vaporizer system was fabricated to produce vaporized ethanol in a volumetric basis (10% and 20%, respectively). It was revealed from the experiments that with co-combustion of oxygenated biofuels, the combustion advanced and peak pressure shifted to TDC. The pressure rise rate decreased with the increase of vaporized ethanol induction and the maximum rate of pressure rise reduction was noted with biodiesel-20% ethanol induction which was 4% lower than biodiesel-10% vaporized ethanol induction. On the other hand, the maximum rate of heat release rate (60.24 J/°CA) was seen in biodiesel with 20% ethanol induction. Furthermore, the co-combustion studies disclosed a two-stage heat release pattern (low temperature and high temperature reactions). It was observed that the increase in ethanol concentration extended low temperature region by 1° crank angle and retarded high temperature region by 3° crank angle. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The direct application of i-propanol-n-butanol-ethanol (IBE) as an assuring alternative biofuel of internal combustion engines to get rid of the high recovery cost and extra energy consumption associated with n-butanol production has been gaining popularity, the research on performance and emissions of engines fueled with IBE are starting to be carried out. However, the available chemical reaction mechanism of IBE for engine combustion model is rarely reported. Therefore, a reduced mechanism named HT-IBE including 151 species and 775 reactions to track the combustion and emissions behavior of engine fueled with IBE/diesel blends was proposed in the present research. It was first meticulously developed based on the coupling of the reduced mechanisms of i-propanol, n-butanol, ethanol and diesel surrogates and the simplified NOx and soot formation models using combined reduction methods of directed relation graph with error propagation and sensitivity analysis (DRGEPSA), computational singular perturbation (CSP) and reaction path analysis (RPA) methods. To improve the predictive power of the mechanism, the sensitive reactions to ignition delay were identified and optimized based on sensitivity analysis. The mechanism was validated against ignition delay, laminar flame speed, and species mole fractions over a wide range of engine relevant conditions. The 3D engine simulation was further carried out using KIVA-3V2-CANTERA coupled with the mechanism to simulate the in-cylinder pressure, heat release rate, NOx and the soot emissions. Results show that the HT-IBE mechanism can reliably predict the combustion characteristics and emissions characteristics of IBE/diesel blends in the CI engine. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The production of sustainable and biodegradable products, for energy or material use, is becoming important for local economies. Thus, biorefineries can play an important role in sustainable development at regional levels and therefore the search for feedstocks with multiple uses is vital. The goal of this research was to assess the implementation of Cynara Cardunculus L. oil as the basis of a biorefinery for biodiesel and biolubricant production, proposing the main steps for this purpose. The chemical reaction selected for biodiesel and biolubricant production was transesterification, using methanol and other more complex alcohols. The optimization of each step was carried out, assessing the yield by gas chromatography. Once the optimum conditions were selected, the main characteristics of the biofuel or biolubricant were measured, paying attention to viscosity and oxidative stability. As a result, Cynara Cardunculus L. oil could be a suitable feedstock for a biorefinery, as long as some antioxidants are added in final products, especially to increase its oxidative stability in biodiesel (whose value was 1.35 h). Concerning biolubricant production, the yields were acceptable (exceeding 92%) and the products showed variable viscosity values (from 8.6 to 18.85 cSt), implying a desirable diversification of production depending on demand. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Crude glycerol was introduced into hydrothermal liquefaction of wastewater-grown algae, Galdieria sulphuraria, to improve yield and energy recovery of bio-crude oil, and to enable solvent-free oil/aqueous phase separation by gravity. Co-hydrothermal liquefaction of 5, 12.5, and 20 wt% solids loading algae and crude glycerol at 350 °C for 30 min gave bio-crude oil yields of 58.8 ± 0.8, 65.5 ± 1.5 and 56.2 ± 1.5 wt%, compared to 14.6 ± 0.1 wt% and 58.1 ± 0.8 wt% for algae alone and crude glycerol alone, respectively. Solvent-free bio-crude oil was upgraded into a liquid biofuel at a yield of 48.1 ± 0.8 wt% and higher heating value of 43.7 ± 0.1 MJ/kg. Incorporation of the co-hydrothermal liquefaction experimental yields and solvent-free phase separation into a techno-economic model for biofuels from hydrothermal liquefaction of algae resulted in a calculated minimum fuel sell price of $0.38–1.24 per liter gasoline equivalent, suggesting substantial potential for co-hydrothermal liquefaction of low-lipid algae with crude glycerol as a competitive strategy for economic 3rd generation biofuel production. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biological CO2 fixation by microalgae coupled with value-added product creation appears to be a sustainable approach in microalgae-based industry. However, the major constraint of this process is the low solubility of CO2 in water which limits CO2 fixation ability by the microalgae. Therefore, the current work aimed to improve the CO2 fixation efficiency of Chlorella vulgaris through the introduction of sequential-flow bubble column photobioreactor system. The influence of various cultivation parameters towards the growth, carbon fixation efficiency, lipid accumulation, and fatty acid profile of C. vulgaris were explored. Experimental results showed that microalgae cultivated under optimized conditions attained the highest biomass productivity (0.83-0.86 »g/L/day) as compared to the control conditions. Meanwhile, the highest lipid content (50.4 % for SFB-PBR1) was recorded when the microalgae were cultivated in the spent medium. In addition, the CO2 fixation efficiency by microalgae in the sequential-flow photobioreactor system under the optimized condition was 3.78-fold higher than a single column mode (control). In short, the present work had demonstrated that cultivation conditions and photobioreactors configuration were equally important for an effective carbon capture process via microalgae cultivation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this paper, argemone mexicana seed was used for the production and characterization of biofuel and biochar using thermochemical conversion process. Thermal pyrolysis of Argemone mexicana seed was carried out in a semi- batch reactor in the temperature range of 400-600 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C/min, maximum liquid product yield of 52 % was obtained at 550 °C. The obtained biofuel was analysed according to its fuel properties, functional groups and compounds present in it. The calorific value of the obtained biofuel was found to be 6542 kcal/kg which is less than diesel fuel. The morphological characteristics of bio-char was determined using SEM and BET analysis which revealed their macroporous surface with a less surface area of 0.208 m2/g. The calorific value of obtained bio-char was 2765.43 kcal/kg which is in the comparable range with solid fuel. The obtained results shows that the Argemone mexicana seed can be used as a potential feedstock of renewable fuels. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper develops a more detailed understanding of when incumbent actors may become the main locomotive driving energy transitions. It also illustrates the trade-offs between policy approaches that actively seek to involve the incumbents in transitions, and policy approaches that pursue transitions without their active involvement. The paper examines state support for the bioeconomy in Sweden and concludes that public investments have been geared towards large-scale, complex and integrated biorefineries that are dependent on the active participation of the forest industry. Incumbents in the forest industry have, however, both lacked motivation and the abilities required to take the necessary steps for commercialisation of the demonstrated concepts. Instead, a rather small investment in a joint venture between actors from the forestry and oil refinery industry in Sweden has spurred learning and revenues; and it has placed an oil refinery at the centre of the future development of what we here term distributed biorefining. The main trade-off is that while this shift has opened up for cross-industrial collaborations and the production of advanced biofuels and materials, it has also paved the way for further investments in existing fossil-fuel infrastructure. © 2020

AB  - The influence of palm oil biodiesel content on the cytotoxicity, mutagenicity and genotoxicity of particle- and gas-phase diesel vehicle emissions was investigated. The emissions were collected on-board of a EURO IV diesel truck, fuelled with mixtures of 10% (B10), 20% (B20) and 100% (B100) of palm oil biodiesel, under real driving conditions. Organic extracts of the particulate matter (PM) and gases were characterised for 17 PAH (including EPA priority) and used for the biological assay. Increasing biodiesel content in the fuel mixture results in a decrease in the PM and PAH emission factors, both in the particulate and gas-phase. The majority of the PAH are present in the gas-phase. The mutagenic potencies, in TA98 bacteria, are higher for B20 in both phases, whereas the mutagenicity emission factor, that takes into account the lower emission of PM and PAH, is not significantly different between the fuels. Higher direct mutagenicity (TA98 + S9) is observed in all the tested fuels, indicating the action of carcinogenic compounds other than non-substituted PAH. The gas-phase extracts present higher cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in lung epithelial cell A549, which may be related to the higher PAH content in the gas-phase. The increase in biodiesel content have a different impact on cytotoxicity, being larger in the gas-phase and lower in the particle-phase. This indicates that pulmonary toxicity may be higher for the gaseous emissions, due to the role of different toxic compounds compared to the PM. The adverse biological effects when biodiesel content increases are not consequent with the reduction of the PAH characterised, indicating that other toxic compounds are more relevant. Further investigations to identify these compounds are required in order to update and focus the efforts regarding emission targets and controls. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - CaO is efficient in catalyzing transesterification for biodiesel production, but its industrial application is inherently restricted by active sites leaching. To address this drawback, CaO is decorated into wollastonite to prepare the stable Ca/wollastonite catalyst. Microwave-assisted transesterification is used to produce biodiesel from palm oil, which effectively accelerates the reaction rate and improves the conversion efficiency. The Ca/wollastonite-0.8 catalyst with the mass ratio of CaO to wollastonite of 0.8 performs well with the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield of 97.59%. Also, this catalyst is highly stable, where the FAME yield of 87.30% could be obtained for the fifth reused cycle. CaO is evenly dispersed on the wollastonite surface and the total basicity is high to 0.281 mmol g−1. Meanwhile, transesterification parameters are optimized by response surface methodology with central composite design (RSM-CCD) and the maximum FAME yield of 98.46% is achieved at reaction temperature of 64.2 °C, molar ratio of methanol to palm oil of 15.54 and mass ratio of catalyst to palm oil of 9.21 wt% for 3 h. Besides, the mass ratio of catalyst to palm oil is the primary variable. Wollastonite is demonstrated to be feasible to enhance the stability of CaO in catalyzing transesterification. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The presented experimental investigation aims at providing a microscopic insight into the flame characteristics of the conventional (light/heavy diesel), a renewable fuel (waste cooking oil), and its blends with light/heavy diesel oils. A hyperspectral camera is used to provide detailed information on fuel reactivity and radiation intensities within the flame zones via the analysis of the C2 and CH radiation emissions. The experiments cover four equivalence ratios (Φ) of 0.63, 0.75, 0.96, and 1.1. A coaxial disc stabilized burner having a twin air jet atomizer is employed. The flame images are taken in the open atmosphere and the assessment of the combustion efficiency is obtained through the measurements of the cooling load inside a cylindrical combustor. The calculated values of the spatial cross-sectional average flame temperatures along the different flames are compared with the corresponding values obtained by a type S thermocouple. The processing of the hyperspectral flame images proves to be an extremely useful tool to define the location, size, and characteristics of the flame zones. The burning of HDO/WCO blend at near stoichiometric conditions appears to be a viable renewable alternative to burning standalone HDO. The burning of a standalone waste cooking oil must be avoided. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of Platymiscium floribundum ethanolic and chloroform extracts on the oxidative stability of soybean biodiesel using the Rancimat and DSC methods. The soybean biodiesel was obtained by transesterification. The antioxidant activity of the extracts was also evaluated by the free radical scavenging (DPPH) method and the total phenolic content by the Folin-Ciocalteu method. Both extracts showed antioxidant activity, reducing the DPPH by about 90%, and the total phenolic content of the ethanolic and chloroform extracts were 2.87 and 3.10 mg GAE/100 mg of extract, respectively. The extracts showed to be very efficient in retarding the oxidation of soybean biodiesel since the induction period increased from 4.53 h to 18.09 h (PF–EtOH, 10000 mg/kg) and 17.58 h (PF–CHCl3, 10000 mg/kg). Both extracts showed high thermal stability with Ton-e of 405.76 °C (PF–CHCl3) and 396.79 °C (PF–EtOH). The presence of the extracts increased the activation energy of the samples between 12.3% and 37.0%. The increase of the activation energy represents an improvement of the oxidative stability of biodiesel. All results confirmed the action of the antioxidants present in the extracts on controlling the oxidation reactions in biodiesel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We investigate the use of rendered poultry fat, beef tallow, and soybean oil as ready sources of free fatty acids (FFAs) and triglycerides (TG) for conversion to renewable diesel. Laboratory scale saponification and decarboxylation experiments using trilaurin, lauric acid, protein, and water as a model compound representing rendered animal fat are reported and combined with chemical process simulations, and thermodynamic and kinematics equations to build energy and material balances where Ab Initio methods are used for estimating missing data to build a life cycle inventory model. Life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for producing renewable diesel from soybean oil, poultry fat, and beef tallow fall between −8.7 and 47.2 g CO2 equivalent/MJ even considering induced land use change when soybean oil is used as feedstock. Emissions vary depending on co-products and allocation rules used, which can affect compliance with energy policies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Herein we report the synthesis of Ru/Zr/Al-SBA-15 catalysts, their characterization by XRD, FT-IR, BET, ICP, FE-SEM, HR-TEM, HAADF-STEM, XPS, TPR, TPD, TGA/DTA and UV-DRS techniques and their catalytic activity towards the hydrogenation of levulinic acid (LA) at ambient H2 pressure under non-corrosive conditions. As the product 2-Methyl Tetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF) obtained in the hydrogenation of levulinic acid is a promising platform chemical having wide applications in the production of biofuels, fine chemicals and green solvents, this research work carries significance. The characterization studies revealed the presence of Zr species well dispersed on SBA-15 and upto 5% loading of Ru over Zr/Al-SBA-15 preserved the mesoporous structure of bare SBA-15. Among the different catalysts, 5% Ru/Zr/Al-SBA-15 (ISM) exhibited the highest catalytic activity with 97% conversion and 84% selectivity towards MTHF in the hydrogenation of levulinic acid without using any solvent. 5% Ru/Zr/Al-SBA-15 catalyst was also synthesized by other methods such as traditional impregnation method (TIM) and ultrasonication method (USM). 5% Ru/Zr/Al-SBA-15 (ISM) showed different morphologies depending on the preparative methods and their catalytic performances were found to be dependent on the method of synthesis. The recyclability of the best catalyst was tested upto five cycles and there was not much variation in terms of conversion and selectivity. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A clean and highly efficient catalytic system for the synthesis of ethyl levulinate (EL) from kitchen waste was developed. A heterogeneous catalyst (Sn/ZrP–SO3H) was prepared and the Brønsted and Lewis acid sites on the surface of the catalyst were evaluated by pyridine FT-IR. Other physicochemical properties were also characterized using XRD, SEM, FT-IR, XPS, BET, NH3-TPD. The yield of EL obtained was 49.27%, when glucose was used as the starting material and subjected to 170 °C for 10 h in the presence of the solid acid catalyst, Sn/ZrP–SO3H. The prepared catalyst was also combined with several metal triflates; (Al(OTf)3, Fe(OTf)3, Sm(OTf)3) to form a catalytic system for the efficient preparation of EL from kitchen waste. Sn/ZrP–SO3H/Al(OTf)3 had superior activity compare to other catalyst combinations. In single factor experiments, the yield of EL reached 52.52% after heating at 170 °C for 4 h. In addition, four-factor and three-level experiments were performed using response surface methodology (RSM) to analyze the interaction between each factor. The optimal reaction conditions predicted by the model (163 °C, 7.63 h, 20 mg Al(OTf)3, 40 mg Sn/ZrP–SO3H and 79.98 mg of kitchen waste) estimated a maximal yield for EL of 51.24%. The experimental yield of EL however was 52.03% which confirms the reliability of the model. This work provides a cleaner production technology for the synthesis of the high value-added chemical EL, and a sustainable route for the utilization of kitchen waste. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A novel solid acidic polymeric ionic liquid catalyst was synthesized for ethyl esters production via the esterification of oleic acid with ethanol, normally transesterification of Pistacia chinensis oil with diethyl carbonate. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy analysis was used to characterize the products and optimize the reaction conditions to provide P. chinensis oil derived ethyl esters in 93% yield. Kinetic studies performed at different temperatures revealed that the conversion of P. chinensis oil to an ethyl ester follows first order reaction kinetics. The properties of ethyl esters were determined, found to meet the ASTM D6751-02. Results revealed that the catalyst had perfect utility after several runs without much loss in activity. The mild conditions (1:5) P. chinensis oil:diethyl carbonate molar ratio, 300 wt% PIL loading, 120 °C, 400 rpm, 6 h, recyclability of the catalyst make the proposed synthesis a sustainable method for the development of ecofriendly, cost-effective biofuels. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, a novel p-toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) based deep eutectic solvent (DES) was prepared successfully for biodiesel production by one-pot method. The DES consisting of PTSA and tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) exhibited the best catalytic activity among the five prepared DESs. Central composite design (CCD) and response surface methodology were conducted to investigate reaction factors. The maximum oil extraction yield 90.33 % and fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) conversion yield 96.53 % were obtained under the optimal condition: microwave temperature 72 °C, microwave power 500 W, time 40 min, the ratio of liquid to seed weight 27:1 and DES amount 11 wt%. The chemical composition of FAMEs and main physical-chemical properties were investigated and the results demonstrated that the prepared biodiesel product possessed high quality. The study showed the prepared DES was a green and efficient catalyst for rapid and simultaneous extraction and transesterification seed oil for biodiesel production by one-pot method. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Demand for alternative energy is steadily increasing due to the depletion of fossil fuels. Converting biomass into alternative fuels has been proposed as a potential solution. Biofuel obtained from biomass through a pyrolysis process is called pyrolysis oil (PO). Because PO is difficult to use directly in conventional engines due to its inadequate fuel properties, various methods have been proposed to improve the fuel properties. Among them, using an alcohol fuel as an organic solvent has been proposed to mix PO with diesel to significantly improve fuel properties. In this study, a blend of diesel, n-butanol, and coffee ground pyrolysis oil (CGO) was applied to a diesel-powered generator. The experimental results showed that stable combustion was possible regardless of fuel type. Although, the fuel consumption rate of the blended fuels was about 20% higher than that of diesel, the efficiencies of all of the test fuels were comparable. NOx emissions decreased about 15–30% for the blended fuels than diesel due to high evaporating latent heat of n-butanol and water content of CGO. The blended fuels showed 70–90% lower PM mass emissions than diesel owing to the oxygen in n-butanol and CGO. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - It is highly desirable but challenging to develop a one-pot process for the transformation of fructose into 2,5-bis(isopropoxymethyl)furan (BPMF), a promising biofuel component, because a cascade sequence involving dehydration, reduction, and etherification requires multifunctional acid catalysts. Herein, we propose a facile and firm assembly of Zr/2-methylimidazole (2-MeIM) coordination polymer over USY zeolite (USY@ZrCP) through N-Al bonds formed by the condensation of 2-MeIM and the hydroxyls on USY surface at room temperature. USY@ZrCP possesses an abundance of strong Lewis acid sites with suitable amount of Bronsted acid sites, which are mainly attributed to the highly dispersed Zr(IV) species and the hydroxyls over USY@ZrCP, respectively. Unexpectedly, USY@ZrCP could offer BPMF yield up to 82.6% from fructose in isopropanol by the integration of dehydration, Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley reduction and etherification in a one-pot strategy. This work proposes a novel approach to prepare highly efficient and robust solid acid catalyst for the catalytic valorization of biomass-derived carbohydrates and their derivatives. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Hydrotreating of vegetable oils offers a green alternative to oil-derived fuels and raw hydrocarbon materials, usually obtained from oil. In contrast to sulfided catalysts, which contaminate the product with sulfur, carbide-based catalysts are able to produce clean hydrocarbons. A NiMo carbide-based catalyst, supported on nanometric γ-alumina was prepared, characterized by X-ray crystallography, Nitrogen physisorption, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The oxidation temperatures and acidity were also determined. Tests were performed in a batch-type reactor for the hydrotreatment of soybean oil at 360, 380, and 400°C and 4.5 MPa. Liquid samples were analyzed by gas chromatography with a mass spectra detector. The reaction rate was calculated showing that reactant concentration did not influence deoxygenation rates, nor did the catalyst revealed a significant change in the activity. The product composition was extensively characterized, proving that reaction temperature greatly influences the concentration of aromatic, unsaturated and saturated hydrocarbons, as well as chain size distributions. © 2020 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - The yield and quality of lipids extracted from microalgal biomass are critical factors in the production of microalgae-based biodiesel. The green microalga Chlorella homosphaera, isolated from Beira Lake, Colombo, Sri Lanka was employed in the present study to identify the effect of chlorophyll removal and cell disruption methods on lipid extraction yield, fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profile and quality parameters of biodiesel; including cetane number (CN), iodine value (IV), degree of unsaturation (DU) and high heating value (HHV). In the first section of this study, chlorophyll was removed from dry microalgae biomass prior to lipid extraction. Through the analysis of FAME profiles, it was observed that chlorophyll removal yielded biodiesel of enhanced quality, albeit with a lipid loss of 44.2% relative to the control. In the second section of the study, mechanical cell disruption strategies including grinding, autoclaving, water bath heating and microwaving were employed to identify the most effective method to improve lipid recovery from chlorophyll-removed microalgae biomass. Autoclaving (121 °C, 20 min sterilization time, total time 2 h) was the most effective cell disruption technique of the methods tested, in terms of lipid extraction yield (39.80%) and also biodiesel quality. Moreover, it was observed that employing cell disruption subsequent to chlorophyll removal has a significant impact on the FAME profile of microalgae-based biodiesel, and consequently served to increase HHV and CN although IV and DU did not vary significantly. © 2020 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan

AB  - In this work, HZSM-5, Al-SBA-15 and Al-SBA-15/HZSM-5 were adopted as supporting materials for the nickel-based catalysts used in hydrodeoxygenation process. Incipient wetness impregnation method was employed to load nickel species onto these materials. The physicochemical characterization was carried out using advanced instruments. The effect of composition of nickel-based catalysts on hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reaction was studied. Support materials of nickel-based catalyst have a significantly impact on HDO activity. The highest selectivity (67.9%) of propyl-cyclohexane was obtained over nickel based Al-SBA-15/HZSM-5 catalyst, and nearly all the eugenol was completely hydrodeoxygenated after reaction. The impact of light fractions existed in bio-oil on phenols upgrading process was investigated. The conversion of eugenol mixed with light fractions reached nearly 100% for all the reactions. Eugenol mixed with light fractions as reactant could reduce ring break reaction during hydrodeoxygenation process. The selectivity of alkanes remained nearly unchanged after adding ethylene glycol into the reactant. However, the selectivity of propyl-cyclohexane was significantly decreased by mixing furfural or acetic acid with eugenol as reactant. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of present study is to investigate the effect of different solvent on lipids extraction efficiency and biodiesel production under optimized process parameters from tannery sludge. Results have revealed that standard chloroform-methanol method has a higher lipid yield of 22.8% (w/v), corresponding to 98.5% (w/v) of lipid extraction efficiency at optimal conditions. The optimized conditions for in-situ transesterification procedure were: catalyst concentration of 3% (v/v), sludge solid to methanol ratio of 1: 25 (w/v), reaction temperature of 60 °C, and time of 12 h, achieving 89.7% yield of biodiesel. Further, the FAME profile of biodiesel analyzed by FT-IR, 1H and 13C NMR, and GC–MS showed the purity of higher than 97.12%. The physicochemical properties of 5% blended biodiesel were found to be within the ASTM standards. This work concluded the production of biodiesel from sludge could be techno-economically viable due to extremely high lipids yield and low-cost of this feedstock. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - BACKGROUND: Microalgae are considered a third–generation raw material for biofuel production. This work compared the conversion of the extracted oil from the freshwater microalgae Scenedesmus rubescens via transesterification for the production of biodiesel. Considering the cost of biodiesel production, heterogeneous catalysts present a significant advantage because of their stability and reusability. Biochar and modified biochar with H2SO4 were used as catalysts. RESULTS: Biochar (BC) was pyrolyzed at 850 °C, under limited oxygen conditions, and was activated by sulphuric acid (H–BC). The catalyst: oil mass ratios tested were from 0 to 0.7:1 for BC, and from 0 to 1:1 for H–BC. The biochar sample exhibited a strong buffer capacity in the pH range between 7 and 5.5, while the acid treated biochar was strongly acidic and could neutralize a significant amount of bases. The produced methyl esters are almost the same in all cases examined. BC samples gave better transesterification results, as far as it concerns the conversion, compared to H–BC. CONCLUSION: The enhanced activity of the BC with mass used may be correlated with the basic minerals presented on the biochar surface. Raw biochar gave better conversion results (47%) during transesterification compared to the modified biochar with H2SO4 (24%) with better catalyst to molar ratio, 0.7:1 and 0.1:1, respectively. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Abstract: Fast pyrolysis bio-oil (FPBO) is a liquid biofuel obtained from lignocellulosic residues. Moreover, biomass fly ashes (FAs) containing many minerals and micronutrients are obtained in the production process. Biomass ashes can be used as a lime substitute for amelioration of acid soils by increasing pH, providing nutrients for crop development and stimulating microbial activity. However, ash application might increase N-mineralization and induce nitrate losses via leaching. The main objective of this study was to investigate the applicability of FPBO-recovered FAs as soil amendment and their effects on soil microbial processes, plant development, and to evaluate the effects on soil leaching. In a greenhouse experiment, an acidic soil was amended with 2% of FAs and sown with a regional wheat variety. After 100 days, wheat was harvested and red clover was sown to simulate crop rotation. After 250 days, the soils were analysed microbiologically and physico-chemically. While no differences in plant yields were observed, FAs addition increased several soil chemical pools as well as certain microbiological parameters. Soil pH increased from 4.8 to 7.2, electrical conductivity from 89 to 407 µS cm−1, and the soil available P pool from 13.6 to 81.3 µg g−1 soil. Further, the nitrification rate, nitrate content in the soil leachates increased upon ash addition, in particular during the clover stage of the experiment. Summarized, despite not measurable effects on the plant growth, fly ash appears to enhance chemical and biological properties of soil cropped with wheat and clover without hinting towards negative environmental side-effects.

AB  - Soil pollution caused by petroleum hydrocarbons is a widespread environmental problem. Composting is one of the cost-effective solutions for petroleum hydrocarbons removal but limited by low efficiency of bioremediation, leading to high phytotoxicity. Given that biogas slurry as nutrients can alter the microbial activity, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of biogas slurry on the remediation of petroleum contaminated soils in composting. Herein, we added biogas slurry into the composting of hydrocarbon contaminated soil to investigate its effect on the biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons, humic acid (HA) transformation and the safety of product. The results showed that biogas slurry addition improved the degradation of organic matter and total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) (especially C > 16), but also increased 18.0% of germination index and the humification degree of HA. The estrone from biogas slurry was removed during composting and did not affect the phytotoxicity level of compost. Redundancy analysis and structural equation modeling indicated that TPH degradation was significantly related to the humification of HA components and total nitrogen from biogas slurry, which contributed to composting safety. Therefore, biogas slurry could be a possible activator for the remediation of petroleum contaminated soils through composting mediated by HA transformation, which is beneficial to obtain the composts with a lower phytotoxicity and higher maturity for soil application. © 2020

AB  - Biofuels are the most promising sustainable and renewable alternative to diesel fuel. In the present renewable energy world, alcohols are gaining prime importance due to their nature of production and fuel properties. The present work aims to investigate the impact of 1-Hexanol and exhaust gas recirculation (10% and 20%) on engine characteristics of the common rail direct injection compression ignition engine. The experiment is carried out on a bench engine. The fraction of 1-Hexanol is varied from 10% to 40% in a step of 10% by volume. The results demonstrate that the use of 1-Hexanol/diesel blends lowers the cylinder pressure and mean gas temperature, which is 4.25% and 1.88% lower at 60% load for 40% 1-Hexanol compared to neat diesel fuel operation. The combustion duration is increased by 2.66˚CA for 40% 1-Hexanol at 60% load compared to neat diesel fuel. However, an improvement in net heat release rate is noted which is 13.95% higher at 60% load for 40% 1-Hexanol, this increment is due to prolonged ignition delay. With the use of 1-Hexanol in the engine, there is a drastic reduction in nitrogen oxide emission is observed, this is the greatest impact of 1-Hexanol. However, a slight increment in the hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emission is also noted due to poor fuel properties like lower cetane number, higher viscosity and higher latent heat of evaporation of 1-Hexanol. Compared to all other blends in the test 10% 1-Hexanol shows comparable results with pure diesel fuel, which is only 2.37% lower in brake thermal efficiency, 3.6% higher in brake specific fuel consumption, 17.55% lower in nitrogen oxide emission, 18.18% higher in hydrocarbon and 33.33% higher in carbon monoxide emission is noted. The exhaust gas recirculation helps in reducing the NOx emission, 40% 1-Hexanol is less sensitive to exhaust gas recirculation. Up to 40% of 1-Hexanol can be used in the CI engine without any modification. It is concluded that 1-Hexanol is a sustainable renewable biofuel due to the reason that even though the use of 1-Hexanol lowers the performance which helps in reducing the NOx emission greatly; the performance can be improved by modifying the engine parameters. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A series of novel mixed metal oxide catalysts with the incorporation of copper as a dopant supported on zinc-alumina (Cu/Zn/γ-Al2O3) for biodiesel production have been synthesized and characterized. ZnO is a solid base catalyst, but its weak surface basic properties have limited the usage of ZnO in the transesterification reaction of refined used cooking oil to biodiesel. To further improve the catalytic activity, the copper dopant was loaded by the wetness impregnation method. Cu/Zn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst of 10:90 wt% dopant-to-based (ZnO) ratio with calcination at 800 °C exhibited the highest biodiesel yield (89.5%) at optimum reaction conditions (65 °C, 10 wt% catalyst loading, 1:20 oil-to-methanol mol ratio and 2 h reaction time). The N2 adsorption-desorption and CO2-temperature programmed desorption analyses indicated that the material possessed a high surface area (149 m2/g) and high basicity (3.7424 mmol/g). The mechanistic study confirmed the catalytic reaction followed the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) model, which involves the initial adsorption of reactants molecules on active sites of the catalyst surface. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Stringent emission norms impose challenges to original equipment manufacturer (OEM) in reducing diesel engine emissions. Implementing renewable fuels as alternative energy sources in diesel engines leads to increased emission levels particularly NOx. In this work, performance, combustion, and emission parameters from a diesel engine powered with grapeseed oil biodiesel (GSBD) was investigated. Nano additive emulsions of cerium oxide (CeO2) and zinc oxide (ZnO) at 100 ppm each were added to grapeseed oil biodiesel. To enhance the NOx reduction task further, an advanced technology called selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system was used. With easy availability of aqueous urea, careful injection, and distribution of the reductant solution, a paradigm change was brought about in NOx reduction technology. The experiments were carried out with and without SCR for better understanding and investigation. The percentage reduction of NOx emission by adding cerium oxide and zinc oxide emulsion blends were 4.19% and 13.13%, respectively. The overall reduction in NOx emission were 74.16% and 80.06% with SCR for cerium oxide and zinc oxide emulsion blends. The research conclusions make grapeseed oil biodiesel conceivable as an effective alternate fuel for diesel engines without any engine modifications. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The generation of large volumes of vinasse during the production of biofuel ethanol is a challenging problem since inappropriate application of the byproduct as an agro-fertigant can give rise to contamination of soil and watercourses and cause harm to aquatic life. The aims of the study were(i) to evaluate an alternative strategy involving the generation of biogas by anaerobic digestion of sugarcane vinasse in two-stage upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors (R1 and R2 connected in series), and (ii) to determine the ethanol content and fermentation efficiency of mashes prepared by diluting sugarcane molasses with deionized water, fresh vinasse and effluents from R1 or R2, both before and after submission to the Fenton reaction. The highest percentages of ethanol were obtained with fermentation mashes prepared from molasses diluted with Fenton-treated R1 (5.1%) or R2 effluents (5.7%) or with non-treated R2 effluent (5.7%). The corresponding fermentation efficiencies of these processes were 88.5, 92.1 and 89.3%. The proposed combination of biofuel and biogas production would provide a sustainable source of energy, contribute to the safe disposal of large quantities of vinasse and help to reduce the volume of freshwater employed by the sugarcane processing industry. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The n-butanol as a clear and renewable biofuel is considered an ideal alternative fuel for SI engines. Hydrogen as a partial alternative fuel can improve the combustion and emissions of SI engine because of its advantages of low ignition energy, fast flame propagation and so no. In order to decrease the additional NOx caused by hydrogen addition, the cooperative effect of EGR and hydrogen direct injection on combustion and emission in an SI n-butanol engine was investigated in this paper. Experiments are conducted at five hydrogen addition ratios (0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%), five EGR ratios (0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%) and three excess air ratios (1, 1.1, 1.2) with 1500 rpm of engine speed. The results indicate that Ttq, Pmax, dQmax and Tmax decrease with the increasing ηEGR and increase with the increasing φH2, while the APmax, AdQmax, θ0–10 and θ10–90 show the contrary tendency. The 15% EGR rate cooperate with 10%~15% hydrogen addition ratio can keep emissions (HC, CO, NOx) better than the original engine. Compared to the original pure butanol engine, the n-butanol engine with hydrogen direct injection and EGR could obtain better comprehensive performance through the coordinated control of φH2 and ηEGR. More speciﬁcally, 15% EGR rate cooperated with 10% hydrogen addition ratio can obtain better comprehensive performance of combustion and emission, but there is a little expense on combustion parameters compared to the original engine under λ = 1. So the 15% EGR ratio is considered a superior EGR ratio cooperated with hydrogen addition. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Rhodococcus strain IGTS8 is the most extensively studied model bacterium for biodesulfurization of fossil fuels via the non–destructive sulfur–specific 4S pathway. This strain was initially assigned to Rhodococcus rhodochrous and later to Rhodococcus erythropolis thus making its taxonomic status debatable and reflecting the limited resolution of methods available at the time. In this study, phylogenomic analyses of the whole genome sequences of strain IGTS8 and closely related rhodococci showed that R. erythropolis and Rhodococcus qingshengii are very closely related species, that Rhodococcus strain IGTS8 is a R. qingshengii strain and that several strains identified as R. erythropolis should be re-classified as R. qingshengii. The genomes of strains assigned to these species contain potentially novel biosynthetic gene clusters showing that members of these taxa should be given greater importance in the search for new antimicrobials and other industrially important biomolecules. The plasmid-borne dsz operon encoding fossil fuel desulfurization enzymes was present in R. qingshengii IGTS8 and R. erythropolis XP suggesting that it might be transferable between members of these species. © Copyright © 2020 Thompson, Cognat, Goodfellow, Koechler, Heintz, Carapito, Van Dorsselaer, Mahmoud, Sangal and Ismail.

AB  - Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is a crucial process for the synthesis of biofuels from renewable biomass. Here, several bimetallic Ni-M/Nb2O5 catalysts (M = Fe, Co, Cu) were synthesized and evaluated in the HDO of biofuel precursors (aldol adduct of furfural with acetone) to liquid alkane and it was found that Ni-Cu/Nb2O5 has the best performance (86.5% yield of octane and 5.1% yield of heptane). Various characterization techniques show that Ni-Cu alloy is formed over the Ni-Cu/Nb2O5 catalyst, which may have the main active metal sites. Moreover, the Ni-Cu alloy has more sites for the adsorption-activation of H2, leading to the high activity. During the HDO process, the ring-opening of the intermediate butyl-tetrahydrofuran (BTHF) and the conversion of octanol are two rate-determining steps. The kinetic study confirms that the ring-opening of BTHF over Ni-Cu/Nb2O5 is more favorable than that over Ni/Nb2O5. More importantly, the Ni-Cu alloy significantly restrained the undesirable decarbonylation due to the weak adsorption of carbonyl, which was key for the efficient production of Cn alkanes. This work provides an in-depth understanding of the role of Ni-Cu alloys and new insights into the design of non-noble metal catalysts for the HDO of biofuel precursors. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - As to metallosilicate zeolites, ions with larger size such as Ta5+ in the gels greatly retarded their crystallization during the hydrothermal synthesis, affording long-winded synthesis periods, up-limited framework-substituted metal contents, or even frustrated outcome. An efficient hydrothermal synthesis strategy for metallosilicate, in this case of Ta framework-substituted *BEA zeolite, via structural reconstruction was proposed to stride the gap. The Ta content in our developed Ta-Beta-Re-50 zeolite achieved up to 5.48 % (Si/Ta = 52), breaking through the limitation of Ta contents for conventional method (Si/Ta &gt; 100). Additionally, this Ta-Beta-Re zeolite possessed nanosized crystals (20–40 nm) and short crystallization time (8 h), significantly improving space-time yields of practical zeolite production. Through spectroscopic study, it was confirmed that the existence of zeolite structural units intensively facilitated the formation of nucleation and crystal growth. This innovative Ta-Beta zeolite demonstrated high catalytic performances for oxidation desulfurization, far outperforming traditional fluoride-mediated Ta-Beta-F, which was ascribed to its excellent diffusion properties and incredible high isolated Ta contents. Additionally, the catalytic performance of Ta-Beta-Re could be regenerated after simple calcination and the deactivation may be caused by pore blocking of organics. This work provides a new method for rationally design and construction of metallosilicate materials with high activity for catalytic oxidation applications, which can bridge the conceptual and technical gap between periodic trends and zeolite material synthesis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A series of nickel–alumina catalysts promoted by copper containing 1, 2, and 5 wt. % Cu and 59, 58, and 55 wt. % Ni, respectively, (symbols: 59Ni1CuAl, 58Ni2CuAl, 55Ni5CuAl) and a non-promoted catalyst containing 60 wt. % Ni (symbol: 60NiAl) were prepared following a one-step co-precipitation method. They were characterized using various techniques (N2 sorption isotherms, XRD, SEM-EDX, XPS, H2-TPR, NH3-TPD) and evaluated in the selective deoxygenation of sunflower oil using a semi-batch reactor (310 ◦C, 40 bar of hydrogen, 96 mL/min hydrogen flow rate, and 100 mL/1 g reactant to catalyst ratio). The severe control of the co-precipitation procedure and the direct reduction (without previous calcination) of precursor samples resulted in mesoporous nano-structured catalysts (most of the pores in the range 3–5 nm) exhibiting a high surface area (192–285 m2 g-1). The promoting action of copper is demonstrated for the first time for catalysts with a very small Cu/Ni weight ratio (0.02–0.09). The effect is more pronounced in the catalyst with the medium copper content (58Ni2CuAl) where a 17.2% increase of green diesel content in the liquid products has been achieved with respect to the non-promoted catalyst. The copper promoting action was attributed to the increase in the nickel dispersion as well as to the formation of a Ni-Cu alloy being very rich in nickel. A portion of the Ni-Cu alloy nanoparticles is covered by Ni0 and Cu0 nanoparticles in the 59Ni1CuAl and 55Ni5CuAl catalysts, respectively. The maximum promoting action observed in the 58Ni2CuAl catalyst was attributed to the finding that, in this catalyst, there is no considerable masking of the Ni-Cu alloy by Ni0 or Cu0. The relatively low performance of the 55Ni5CuAl catalyst with respect to the other promoted catalysts was attributed, in addition to the partial coverage of Ni-Cu alloy by Cu0, to the remarkably low weak/moderate acidity and relatively high strong acidity exhibited by this catalyst. The former favors selective deoxygenation whereas the latter favors coke formation. Copper addition does not affect the selective-deoxygenation reactions network, which proceeds predominantly via the dehydration-decarbonylation route over all the catalysts studied. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - With an ongoing interest in displacing petroleum-based sources of energy with biofuels, there is a need to measure and model the formation and composition of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from organic compounds present in biofuels. We performed chamber experiments to study SOA formation from four recently identified biofuel molecules and mixtures and commercial gasoline under high NOx conditions: diisobutylene, cyclopentanone, an alkylfuran mixture, and an ethanol-to-hydrocarbon (ETH) mixture. Cyclopentanone and diisobutylene had a significantly lower potential to form SOA compared to commercial gasoline, with SOA mass yields lower than or equal to 0.2%. The alkylfuran mixture had an SOA mass yield (1.6%) roughly equal to that of gasoline (2.0%) but ETH had an average SOA mass yield (11.5%) that was six times higher than that of gasoline. We used a state-of-the-science model to parameterize or simulate the SOA formation in the chamber experiments while accounting for the influence of vapor wall losses. Simulations performed with vapor wall losses turned off and at atmospherically relevant conditions showed that the SOA mass yields were higher than those measured in the chamber at the same photochemical exposure and were also higher than those estimated using a volatility basis set that was fit to the chamber data. The modeled SOA mass yields were higher primarily because they were corrected for vapor wall losses to the Teflon® chamber. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - This research has developed a soap-derived biokerosene (SBK) production process to produce hydrocarbons for use as an aviation alternative fuel. The SBK production process was developed in keeping with the conditions of the available technologies and investment while leveraging the advantage of an abundant national feedstock resource that is found in Indonesia in particular, and tropical emerging countries in general. The production of SBK comprises two main processes: saponification and thermal decarboxylation to convert coconut oil into hydrocarbons. The composition of SBK was analyzed and compared to that of Jet A1. Additionally, the critical properties of SBK and several of its blends with Jet A1 were measured and collated with the established jet fuel standard. The results show that SBK can be blended directly with Jet A1 at up to 10 vol.% to meet selected properties: distillation temperature, flash point, density, net heating value, viscosity, freezing point, smoke point, and oxidation stability. From this study, it can be concluded that SBK is feasible for use as a drop-in aviation fuel when blended with conventional jet fuel. Thus, the SBK production is highly promising for use in tropical countries to produce aviation biofuels, given the appropriate technologies and feedstock resources. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Medium-chain esters are versatile chemicals with broad applications as flavors, fragrances, solvents, and potential drop-in biofuels. Currently, these esters are largely produced by the conventional chemical process that uses harsh operating conditions and requires high energy input. Alternatively, the microbial conversion route has recently emerged as a promising platform for sustainable and renewable ester production. The ester biosynthesis pathways can utilize either lipases or alcohol acyltransferase (AAT), but the AAT-dependent pathway is more thermodynamically favorable in an aqueous fermentation environment. Even though a cellulolytic thermophile Clostridium thermocellum harboring an AAT-dependent pathway has recently been engineered for direct conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into esters, the production is not efficient. One potential bottleneck is the ester degradation caused by the endogenous carbohydrate esterases (CEs) whose functional roles are poorly understood. The challenge is to identify and disrupt CEs that can alleviate ester degradation while not negatively affecting the efficient and robust capability of C. thermocellum for lignocellulosic biomass deconstruction. In this study, by using bioinformatics, comparative genomics, and enzymatic analysis to screen a library of CEs, we identified and disrupted the two most critical CEs, Clo1313_0613 and Clo1313_0693, that significantly contribute to isobutyl acetate degradation in C. thermocellum. We demonstrated that an engineered esterase-deficient C. thermocellum strain not only reduced ester hydrolysis but also improved isobutyl acetate production while maintaining effective cellulose assimilation. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - As the effects of climate change become apparent, metabolic engineers and synthetic biologists are exploring sustainable sources for transportation fuels. The design and engineering of microorganisms to produce gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel compounds from renewable feedstocks can significantly reduce our dependence on fossil fuels as well as lower the emissions of greenhouse gases. Over the past 2 decades, a considerable amount of work has led to the development of microbial strains for the production of advanced fuel compounds from both C5 and C6 sugars. In this work, we combined two strategies—adaptive laboratory evolution and rational metabolic engineering—to improve the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae’s ability to utilize d-xylose, a major C5 sugar in biomass, and produce the advanced biofuel isobutanol. Whole genome resequencing of several evolved strains followed by reverse engineering identified two single nucleotide mutations, one in CCR4 and another in TIF1, that improved the yeast’s specific growth rate by 23% and 14%, respectively. Neither one of these genes has previously been implicated to play a role in utilization of d-xylose. Fine-tuning the expression levels of the bottleneck enzymes in the isobutanol pathway further improved the evolved strain’s isobutanol titer to 92.9 ± 4.4 mg/L (specific isobutanol production of 50.2 ± 2.6 mg/g DCW), a 90% improvement in titer and a 110% improvement in specific production over the non-evolved strain. We hope that our work will set the stage for an economic route to the advanced biofuel isobutanol and enable efficient utilization of xylose-containing biomass. © 2020, Society for Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology.

AB  - This study focuses on the mechanical extraction of Jatropha curcas L. oil using a screw press type expeller. The extraction process was carried under different operating conditions to assess the impact on oil yield, oil recovery, extraction capacity, energy intensity, and the required properties as drop-in biofuel or as biodiesel feedstock. The studied variables were the extraction temperature (50 °C, 70 °C and 90 °C), rotational speed of the screw (40 rpm, 50 rpm and 60 rpm), and nozzle diameter at the end of the press (11 mm, 12 mm and 13 mm). The highest oil yield was obtained at the highest temperature, the lowest rotational speed, and using the smallest nozzle diameter. As expected, throughput of the screw press decreased when oil yield increased, nevertheless power consumption barely changed within the evaluated range of operating conditions. Preferred extraction conditions were 90 °C, 40 rpm and cake outlet nozzle diameter of 11 mm. Under these conditions, extraction pressure was 15.35 MPa with a specific energy consumption of 0.09 kW h/kgSeed. The corresponding oil yield, oil recovery, and extraction capacity were 25.40%, 56.8% and 8.93 kg/h, respectively. By preheating the seeds at 60 °C during 30 min increases oil recovery 15.7% but reduces extraction capacity 16.9%. According to fuel standards, the extracted oil is suitable as drop-in fuel for diesel engines without further refining. Furthermore, it was experimentally demonstrated that the extracted crude oil can be directly transformed into biodiesel using a traditional alkali-based process. © 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - A lot of studies were conducted in recent years to improve of biodiesel performance. It has been stated that the addition of additives in biodiesel reduces emissions of unburned hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (PM). It makes a significant improvement in thermal efficiency (BTE) and heat dissipation rate (HRR). The additives are attractive in automotive applications due to their excellent phase stability and clean combustion ability. Engine performance and exhaust emissions are mainly based on air-fuel ratio, cetane number, oxygen content of fuel, fuel atomization and the other features. In this study, two different additives were added to the biodiesel to change the number of cetane. In addition, engine performance and emission changes were investigated experimentally. The viscosity and density of fuels were reduced by additives. Compared to R0 fuel, torque increased by 9.74% and 7.22% in RHD20 and RHX20 fuels respectively. While specific fuel consumption decreased by 9.58% and 6.50% respectively. The ignition delay and combustion times decreased due to combustion quality. Maximum cylinder pressure and heat release rate values increased after additives adding in fuels. With the increase of the additive rate, HC (RHD20 23.68%, RHX20 21.05%), CO (RHD20 16.89%, RHX20 15.81%), and soot (RHD20 34.35%, RHX20 26.19%) emissions reduced while NOx (RHD20 2.26%, RHX20 3.21%) emissions increased. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Large-scale commercialization of drop-in biofuel technologies requires a deeper understanding of the molecular structure of biocrude oils and their compatibility with fossil crudes in terms of molecular interactions that govern miscibility. For the first time, the compatibility of hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) derived biocrude obtained from pinewood with straight-run gas oil (SRGO) was comprehensively investigated by theoretical prediction using Hansen double sphere plots and experimental confirmation from miscibility studies to achieve a biofeed compatible for coprocessing at refineries. The Hansen solubility parameters (HSPs) for biocrude, biocrude components (residue and light and heavy distillate fractions), and SRGO were determined by plotting a three-dimensional Hansen solubility sphere plot based on the experimental solubility data obtained on their solubility studies in 38 different solvents. The compatibility of HTL biocrude oil with SRGO was verified from the solubility distance (Ra) and relative energy difference (RED) values obtained from the center of their Hansen spheres and difference in HSPs, respectively, in a Hansen double sphere solubility plot. The experimental data obtained on miscibility studies confirmed that pyridine, cyclohexanone, and a pyridine-cyclohexanone solvent mixture (1:1) occupy a well-defined Hansen space and show fitting to HSPs of the biocrude-SRGO blend, improve the overall compatibility of the blending mixture, and display a maximum miscibility of 72%. To correlate the compatibility with the molecular structure, the compatibility of light, heavy, and residual fractions obtained by fractional distillation of HTL biocrude (pinewood) was also evaluated with SRGO using the Hansen double sphere plot, and a close agreement with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results as well as the experimental data on miscibility studies was verified. Furthermore, the comprehensive estimation of the detailed composition and chemical nature of biocrude and light, heavy, and residual fractions by the means of elemental (CHN/O), GC-MS, and GC × GC analysis was also presented. Additionally, the correlation between compatibility and interactions within chemical functionalities of blend components was established by analyzing the contribution of aromatic, aliphatic, and oxygen containing functional groups to the miscibility using quantitative 13C NMR spectroscopy. The present study reports a mixing strategy to assess the compatibility of biocrudes, heavy distillate fractions, asphaltenes, residues, and polymers with existing petroleum infrastructure for the cost-effective biorefinery process to balance economic and environmental considerations.

AB  - The present paper investigates the feasibility of using acetone (ACE) in triple blends with fossil diesel (D) and straight vegetable oils (SVOs) as alternative fuel for diesel engines. In this respect, ACE is selected as an oxygenated additivedue to its favorable propertiesto be mixed with vegetable oils and fossil diesel. In fact, the very low kinematic viscosity allows reduces the high viscosity of SVOs. ACE’s oxygen content, low autoignition temperature, and very low cloud point and pour point values highlight its possibilities as an additive in D/ACE/SVO triple blends. Moreover, ACE can be produced through a renewable biotechnological process, an acetone–butanol–ethanol (ABE) fermentation from cellulosic biomass. The SVOs tested were castor oil (CO), which is not suitable for human consumption, and sunflower oil (SO), used as a standard reference for waste cooking oil. The viscosity measurement of the ACE/SVO double blend was considered crucial to choose the optimum proportion, which better fulfilled the specifications established by European standard EN 590. Moreover, some of the most significant physicochemical properties of D/ACE/SVO triple blends, such as kinematic viscosity, cloud point, pour point, and calorific value, were determined to assess their suitability as fuels. The blends were evaluated in a conventional diesel generator through the study of the following parameters: engine power, smoke emissions, and fuel consumption. Despite the low calorific value of ACE limits its ratio in the mixtures due to engine knocking problems, the experimental results reveal an excellent performance for the blends containing up to 16-18% of ACE and 22-24% of SVO. These blends produce similar engine power as to fossil diesel, but with slightly higher fuel consumption. Considerable reductions in emissions of air pollutants, as well as excellent cold flow properties are also obtained with these triple blends. In summary, the use of these biofuels could achieve a substitution of fossil diesel up to 40%, independently on the SVO employed. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The present experimental study aims to examine the impacts of various fueling modes of operation on the particle-phase polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and n-alkanes (C16–C30), and volatility and oxidation reactivity of particulate matter (PM) emitted from a diesel engine fueled with a ternary fuel (80% diesel, 5% biodiesel and 15% ethanol (D80B5E15, volume %)) under four engine operating conditions. Four fueling modes, including diesel, blended, fumigation and combined fumigation + blended (F + B) modes were tested using pure diesel fuel for diesel mode and a constant fuel content of D80B5E15 for the blended, fumigation and F + B modes to create the same condition for comparing their impacts on the parameters investigated. The average results illustrate that both blended and fumigation modes can reduce the PAHs (−78.4% and −31.3%), benzo[a]pyrene equivalent (−81.7% and −38.9%), n-alkanes (−46.5% and −21.5%) and non-volatile substance fraction (−25.1% and −11.1%), but increase the high-volatile substance fraction (12.8% and 6.9%) and oxidation reactivity rate (34.0% and 4.9%), respectively compared to those of the diesel mode. While the effect of the blended mode on the parameters investigated is stronger than the fumigation mode. And the F + B mode has the effects in between the results of the blended and fumigation modes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The thermal and oxidation stability of fatty acids methyl esters (FAME) is arousing attention in the transport industry, since they are the main components present in biodiesel products used in the market. Low FAME stability can induce easy fuel degradation and produce oxidation products that can form sticky deposit causing serious malfunctioning and failures of engine and turbines components. We have focused the present work on the study of fuel oxidation process and the characterization of oxidation products in order to identify the main levers to avoid deposit formation. Soy and Rapeseed biodiesels were oxidized using an autoclave Parr reactor and characterized by FTIR, density and viscosity measurements. After oxidation, two different liquid phases were clearly observed. These two phases tend to form complex oil-oil emulsions after remixing as evidenced by optical microscopy. The separation behavior of the different liquid phases remixed after oxidation were studied using Multiple Light Scattering (TurbiscanTM). A comparison was made between the chemical functions of deposit obtained in the liquid phase after demixing (sedimented phase) and the solid deposit obtained on hot metallic surfaces. Results showed a that a complex oil-oil dispersion seems to form during the oxidation process. The phase separation rate of the oil-oil emulsified systems formed from oxidized fuels seems strongly related to the differences of polarity (e.g. oxygenates content) of both sedimented and supernatant phases. The understanding of this sedimentation or “demixing” process leading to deposit can be a key feature to develop strategies to prevent deposit formation in real systems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Taking into consideration the quality of air, it is necessary to ensure a continued reduction of the gaseous emissions that are produced by the maritime transport. The most effective solution of this serious worldwide problem is application of a suitable fuel mixture, which contains a bio-component, i.e. the biofuel. The presented scientific study is focused on influence of the biofuels on production of the gaseous emissions in the case of a diesel auxiliary engine, which is used in the ship transport. There were created various fuel mixtures with different content of the bio-component in order to investigate their emission characteristics. The individual experimental measurements were performed at the different engine loading levels and using a variable engine speed spectrum. The obtained results demonstrated a significant influence of the fuel mixtures on the whole combustion process, on the heat release process, on the pressure time behaviour as well as on the engine emission characteristics. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The background for this paper was a wish to extend the understanding of how sustainable transitions in sociotechnical systems come about, especially the characteristics of processes and the role of actors. The empirical context was the case of developing biogas production and improving transport in the Trondheim region in Norway. The case consisted of two connected units; establishment of a biogas plant (production side) and development of a sustainable public transport system (use side). As a template for the analysis, the Multilevel Perspective (MLP) on sociotechnical transitions was applied. The core in this perspective is the (sociotechnical) regime level, where changes have to occur in order for sustainable transitions to take place. Central at the regime level is the interaction between actors, technologies and institutions. Transitions can take place if actors experience threats from the external world and have access to niche innovations. Analysis of the case showed that the development first went through a transformation phase (ca. 1990–2009) where R&D actors developed basic technical innovations. In the next phase (2009–2019) there was a reconfiguration process were politicians and market actors engaged. Over the years, this process resulted in significant sustainability outcomes (increased production of biogas and exchange of fossil for biofuels in transport). Three major lessons can be drawn: 1) the crucial role of leadership when it comes to interpreting external changes, timing of actions and coordination of resources, 2) the necessity of new technological innovations and their adoption on regime level, and 3) differentiated state support can develop demand for renewable products and is necessary for compensating extra costs for niche actors. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, engine operating conditions which given the best result in terms of performance, exhaust emission and combustion characteristics in a thermal barrier coated (TBC) diesel engine, which was covered with ceramic on combustion chamber elements, were determined by multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method. It was also included in the optimization of the data obtained from the uncoated (standard) engine (STD) in order to better evaluate the TBC engine. In the experimental study, diesel, pure biodiesel derived from cotton oil frying waste and biodiesel/diesel blend fuels (5, 20 and 50% by volume) were used as fuel. In optimization, operational competitiveness rating (OCRA) was preferred as a MCDM. The experimental data, which included a total of six hundred data, in TBC and STD engines fueled biodiesel and its blends were used in optimization. According to the optimization result, the best results in terms of engine performance, exhaust emission and combustion characteristics were generally obtained from the TBC engine. According to the optimization sequence, the ranking obtained from the TBC engine were observed to be ahead of the STD engine at all engine speeds. It was also found that the best results were concentrated at engine speeds of 1800 rpm and 2100 rpm. The best result was achieved by using B20 (20% biodiesel + 80% diesel) in TBC engine at 1800 rpm. The performance, emission and combustion characteristics obtained under these optimum operating parameters (OOP) were also compared with those of the STD engine fueled with B0 and B100. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The catalytic deoxygenation of biomass to produce renewable carbon energy addresses major concerns of limited energy sources. In particular, the second-generation biodiesel by selective deoxygenation possesses a higher cetane number, lower cloud point, and higher oxidation stability compared to the fatty acid ester-based biodiesel, and therefore, can be fed directly to the current diesel engines. In present work, we address the significant concerns of cost-effectiveness, high hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) selectivity, modest hydrogen environments, and solvent-free condition using high surface area silica-alumina-supported cobalt oxide nanoparticles as a catalyst to produce fuel-grade hydrocarbons from fatty acid-based feeds that are palm oil and jatropha oil. The catalytic performance is tested for methyl stearate to achieve the best conversion efficiency with remarkable deoxygenation selectivity. The HDO selectivity was as high as 87% at 250 °C and 30 bar H2 pressure, whereas moderate HDO selectivity with relatively higher cracking was observed at 300 °C and 2 bar H2 pressure. Remarkably, the HDO selectivity was comparable in the absence of solvent. The catalyst is recyclable with low metal leaching during the deoxygenation. The use of non-noble metal catalysts under solvent-free conditions offers facile production of fuel-grade hydrocarbons. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Wide-scale screening of naturally occurring algal strains has been conducted all over the world for nutrient removal and biofuel production. However, very few studies have been carried out in the region of Saudi Arabia, especially related to high-yielding oleic acid strains. The current study is focussed on the isolation of indigenous microalgae strains that were analyzed for N/P removal and biofuel production. Three strains were isolated, and identified as Chlorella kessleri (S1), Chlorella vulgaris (S2) and Nanochloropsis oculata (S3). The S2 strain showed the highest dry weight as compared to S1 and S3. All of the isolated strains showed greater than 90% nitrate and phosphate removal. Lipid contents of 19, 27 and 14% were found in S1, S2 and S3, respectively. Fatty acid profiles using Gas Chromatography Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID) showed 18, 22 and 16% yield of palmitic and 6, 4 and 5% yield of stearic acid in S1, S2 and S3, respectively. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This paper evaluates supply, operational- and market-risk reduction opportunities for the case where management at a cellulosic biorefinery adopts a supply chain design based on a distributed depot concept. In contrast to the conventional feedstock-supply system, a supply chain based on a network of depots providing feedstock to a biorefinery employs geographically distributed depots where feedstock undergoes preprocessing into densified pellets, thus allowing feedstock to be transported a greater distance. This study used simulation methods to show that distributed depots may work as a risk absorber for a cellulosic biorefinery. Compared to a base case, a distributed depot supply system reduced the operational and market risk by 17.5% and 5%, respectively. Moreover, when contract management and alternatives markets were considered, a reduction of supply, operational, and market risk, by approximately 48%, 69%, and 35%, respectively, were observed. The expected return on investment (ROI) increased from −4% to 33%. However, this positive ROI largely depends on assuming commoditization and the creation of intermediate markets for alternative, merchandisable products. © 2019

AB  - The production of biodiesel from Scenedesmus algal oil is one of the best alternative forms of liquid fuel production from biomass to petrol diesel. Biodiesel plays a significant role in the carbon sequestration process during cultivation. Scenedesmus algal species was isolated and cultured in a bold basal medium by using nonheat releasing white florescence (2500 lx) for a 12:12-h dark and light cycle. Algae oil was extracted from dried microalgae biomass through a microwave digester–assisted solvent extraction method. Consequently, about 20.8% algal oil per gram was obtained. A waste-based calcium oxide (CaO) nano-catalyst prepared from goat bone was used in the transesterification process. The catalyst was calcinated at 900 °C and characterized using FTIR, SEM, EDX, and XRD techniques. The results revealed a mean particle size of 43.96 nm with an irregular shape, porous structure, and possession of many active sites. The optimized transesterification process offers an optimum biodiesel yield of 92% at the experimental conditions, i.e., at a reaction temperature of 60 °C, 2% (Wt.) catalyst loading and 11:1 methanol to algal oil molar ratio, 1500 rpm stirring speed, and 3 h reaction duration. The physicochemical properties of the produced biodiesel were tested according to ASTM D6751 standards and are in good agreement. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This paper presents the results of research on the preparation and use for energy purposes of three reed herbaceous energy plants: reed (Phragmites australis) and bulrush (Typha); both grown in local vicinities on lakes and riverbanks and reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea L.). The physical-mechanical characteristics (density, moisture, and ash content) of chopped and milled reeds were investigated. The investigation of mill fractional compositions determined the largest amount of mill-reed mill, collected on the sieves of 0.63 mm (40.0%). The pellet moisture ranged from 10.79% to 6.32%, while the density was 1178.9 kg m−3 for dry matter (DM) of reed. The ash content of reed, bulrush and reed canary grass pellets was 3.17%, 5.88%, and 7.99%, respectively. The ash melting temperature ranged from 865 to 1411 ◦C; these temperatures were high enough for ash melting. The determined pellet calorific value varied from 17.4 to 17.9 MJ kg−1 DM. The disintegration force, indicating pellet strength, ranged from 324.25 N for reed canary grass to 549.24 N for reed. The determined emissions of harmful pollutants-CO2, CO, NOx, and unburnt hydrocarbons (CxHy)-did not exceed the maximum permissible levels. The assessment of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from technology showed that the CO2 equivalents ranged from 7.3 to 10.1 kg CO2-eq. GJ−1 for reed and reed canary grass, respectively. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Nannochloris atomus (QUCCCM31) is a local marine microalga showing potential to serve as renewable feedstock for biodiesel production. The investigation of the impact of temperature variation and nitrogen concentrations on the biomass and lipid productivities evidenced that biomass productivity increased with the temperature to reach an optimum of 195 mgL-1 d-1 at 30 °C. Similarly, the lipid content was strongly influenced by the elevation of temperature; indeed, it increased up to ~3 folds when the temperature increased from 20 to 40 °C. When both stresses were combined, triacylglycerols and lipid productivity reached a maximum of 45% and 88 mgL-1 d-1, respectively at 40 °C. Cultures under high temperatures along with Nitrogen-Depleted (ND) favored the synthesis of Fatty Acids Methyl Ester (FAMEs) suitable for high quality biodiesel production, whereas cultures conducted at low temperature coupled with Nitrogen-Limited (NL) led to a production of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Our results support the feasibility of cultivating the thermotolerant isolate QUCCCM31 year-round to meet the sustainability challenges of algal biomass production by growing under temperature and nitrogen variations. The presence of omega 3 and 9 fatty acids as valuable co-products will help in reducing the total process cost via biorefinery. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Environmental regulations motivate the industries to replace conventional fuels and chemicals by those produced from biomass. In this regard, hydrodeoxygenation of lignin compounds is of a great deal of attention. Synthesis gas could be utilized instead of pure hydrogen for the cleavage of oxygen-containing chemical bonds through hydrodeoxygenation. Following this, the utilization of synthesis gas is investigated in the present contribution. A wide range of commercial alumina-supported catalysts is investigated. The experimental results of cyclohexanone hydrodeoxygenation in the presence of pure hydrogen and synthesis gas at 573 K and 20 bar of total pressure are presented and discussed. The whole investigated catalysts show good activity toward the hydrodeoxygenation of cyclohexanone. Methylatedbenzene derivatives are produced from cyclohexanone hydrodeoxygenation for the first time. The catalysts composed of platinum showed the best performance. By utilizing a chlorinated platinum catalyst, 89.6% cyclohexanone conversion, 100% total hydrocarbon selectivity, and 44.6% total hydrocarbon yield are obtained. In the case of syngas-assisted hydrodeoxygenation, 80.1% cyclohexanone conversion, 100% total hydrocarbon selectivity, and 29.6% total hydrocarbon yield are obtained by utilizing the same catalyst. The presence of methylated aromatics proves the accomplishment of methanation or direct aromatization reactions in the presence of carbon oxides and hydrogen. © 2020 Curtin University and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Comprehensive gas chromatography (GC) has emerged in recent years as the technique of choice for the analysis of volatile and semivolatile compounds in complex matrices. Coupling it with high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) makes a powerful tool for identification and quantification of organic compounds. The results obtained in this study showed a significant improvement by using GC×GC-EI-MS in comparison with GC-EI-MS; the separation of chromatogram peaks was highly improved, which facilitated detection and identification. However, the limitation of Orbitrap mass analyzer compared with time-of-flight analyzer is the data acquisition rate; the frequency average was about 25 Hz at a mass resolving power of 15.000, which is barely sufficient for the proper reconstruction of the narrowest chromatographic peaks. On the other hand, the different spectra obtained in this study showed an average mass accuracy of about 1 ppm. Within this average mass accuracy, some reasonable elemental compositions can be proposed and combined with characteristic fragment ions, and the molecules can be identified with precision. At a mass resolving power of 7.500, the scan rate reaches 43 Hz and the GC×GC-MS peaks can be represented by more than 10 data points, which should be sufficient for quantification. The GC×GC-MS was also applied to analyze a cellulose bio-oil sample. Following this, a highly resolved chromatogram was obtained, allowing EI mass spectra containing molecular and fragment ions of many distinct molecules present in the sample to be identified. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Pyrolysis oil produced from forestry residues is used as a low-grade fuel in applications such as heating oil. However, the high water and acid content can lead to fuel instability, phase separation, poor lubrication, and corrosion. In this work, pervaporation has been studied as a process to simultaneously upgrade a pyrolysis oil produced from Canadian softwood bark to meet a boiler fuel standard and extract value-added chemicals. Commercial polyacrylonitrile-supported polyvinyl alcohol membranes from DeltaMem AG were used at temperatures of 60 and 80 °C to separate water and volatile organic components, including methanol, acetic acid, and acetol. A design of experiment study was used to define the range of operating conditions. A temperature of 80 °C and a low feed flow rate of 0.1 mL min−1 resulted in the highest quality oil. The upgraded pyrolysis oil (pervaporation retentate) showed an increased heating value from incomplete combustion to 16.07 MJ kg−1 and the water content was lowered from 70.2 wt% in the feedstock to 21.4 wt%, demonstrating the potential for this process on a larger scale. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The production of biodiesel from fatty acid distillates (FAD) is a technically viable route but the assessment of engine performance and environmental impact are non-well researched issues. The scope of this contribution is to develop a characterization of the FAD obtained as a waste product from the vegetable oil refining industry and to evaluate the biodiesel performance and exhaust emissions on a diesel engine. A physicochemical characterization is also developed. The gas chromatography results show the fatty acids profile, indicating 50.56% of linoleic acid. Acidity level indicated that the FAD must be converted to biodiesel before its use on a diesel engine. The conversion of FAD to biodiesel reaches 92% yield. Combustion of biodiesel from FAD shows 80% increase in the specific fuel consumption and 5.6% in NOx, shorter ignition delay and hydrocarbons and CO reductions in 22% and 46%, respectively. The results demonstrate the viability to produce biofuels from FAD, which also leads to a reduction of environmental pollutants. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - During the last three decades, hydroprocessed fuels, biodiesel, and hybrid fuels derived from vegetable oils and animal fats were emerging as the prominent biofuels for compression ignition engine. A comparative analysis of production, chemical structure, fuel properties, and cost estimation of waste cooking oil-based biodiesel, hybrid fuel, and hydroprocessed fuels was carried out and reported in this article. Biodiesel was produced by transesterification process; hybrid fuel was prepared by three-phase microemulsion process, while hydroprocessed fuels were produced via hydro-processing followed by true boiling point distillation as per ASTM D2892 and ASTM D5236 specifications. The principal fuel properties of the biodiesel, hybrid fuel, and hydroprocessed fuels were measured as per ASTM/EN standards and compared with those of petro-diesel. The production cost per liter (L) of each of the biofuel was computed at the lab scale level. Moreover, the initial capital cost estimation for 400 L/batch/day pilot plant has been estimated on the basis of land, infrastructure, instruments, laboratory glassware, feedstock, chemicals, and workers. It is anticipated that more than 0.28 million USD are needed for the complete setup of pilot plant, which can get an approximate revenue of 0.1 million USD per annum, besides the environmental benefits. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This paper addresses the application of MCDM in the selection of biofuel as discussed elaborately here which encompasses different aspects like fuel properties, engine performances, and emissions. Selection of the right kind of biofuel is essential in so far as technical, social, environmental and economic benefits are concerned. The authors here opine that selection of biofuel is strategically as well as inevitably important when different biofuel performances exhibit a conflicting scenario or performances of different blends of biofuel(s) seem almost the same. Further, it is also stated that the selection of any biofuel arbitrarily can call for erratic performances. The highest beneficial effect of biofuel has been explored here by taking a strategic decision. The authors also highlight here the importance of applying decision-making method under the fuzzy environment using the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method. Five types of biofuels have been examined here for the present studies together with petrodiesel as a reference one. Real life experimental data have been taken into consideration for this present decision making calculation excluding analysis of experimental results in case of each biofuel under experiment. Ranking of the alternatives obtained has been further studied through sensitivity analysis here keeping an eye on finding out of the most robust biofuel. Fuzzy TOPSIS method applied here helps selects decisively that the neem-petrodiesel blend is the most preferred one and also establishes by applying sensitivity analysis that this blend is the most robust one. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The integrated production of biodiesel and biogas has been explored by using N. gaditana, I. galbana and A. platensis as substrate. Three fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) production approaches were assessed, namely an indirect process with previously extracted lipids (IPPEL), an indirect process with extracted lipids as free fatty acids (IPELFFA) and a direct process (DP) without a previous lipid extraction stage. Besides de FAEE production, these approaches are considered as pre-treatments of the microbial biomasses evaluated in this study with the objective of increasing the methane yield during the anaerobic digestion. Biogas yields of the residues generated under the three FAEE production methodologies were compared to the biogas yield of the raw feedstock. In all cases, the biodiesel and biogas yields were higher after the FAEE production process from the previously extracted lipids as free fatty acids (IPELFFA). Therefore, this constitutes an interesting and promising route in the joint production of biodiesel and biogas. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Amano lipase from Pseudomonas fluorescens (L-AK) was covalently immobilized on various carbon nanomaterials (functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes and graphene oxide) and tested for biodiesel production. Using the most active lipase preparation (covalently immobilized L-AK on SwCNTNH2 derivatized with glycerol diglycidyl ether) under optimal conditions, quasi-complete conversion (>99%) of sunflower oil was obtained after only 4 h reaction time. Moreover, the biocatalyst maintained more than 99% of its initial activity in the batch system after multiple recycling experiments. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The life cycle human health (HH) impacts related to aviation biofuels have been understood in a limited way. Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) methods for assessing HH are often associated with a high level of uncertainty and a low level of consensus. As a result, it remains challenging to perform a robust assessment of HH impacts with a suitable LCIA method. This study aims to systematically compare six commonly used LCIA methods for quantifying HH impacts, in order to empirically understand the potential impacts of aviation biofuel production on HH and how the results are affected by the choice of methods. Three aviation biofuel production pathways based on different feedstocks (sugarcane, eucalyptus, and macauba) were analyzed and compared to fossil aviation biofuels, on the basis of a functional unit of 1 MJ aviation fuel. The majority of the LCIA methods suggest that, in respect to midpoint impacts, macauba-based biofuel is associated with the lowest impacts and eucalyptus-based biofuel the highest; whereas at endpoint level, the results are more scattered. The LCIA methods agree that biomass conversion into aviation biofuel, H2 production, and feedstock cultivation are major contributors to life cycle HH impacts. Additionally, we provide a guideline for determining an appropriate method for assessing HH impacts. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Miscanthus x giganteus (Mxg) is a promising second-generation biofuel crop with high production of energetic biomass. Our aim was to determine the level of plant stress of Mxg grown in poor quality soils using non-invasive physiological parameters and to test whether the stress could be reduced by application of plant growth regulators (PGRs). Plant fitness was quantified by measuring of leaf fluorescence using 24 indexes to select the most suitable fluorescence indicators for quantification of this type of abiotic stress. Simultaneously, visible stress signs were observed on stems and leaves and differences in variants were revealed also by microscopy of leaf sections. Leaf fluorescence analysis, visual observation and changes of leaf anatomy revealed significant stress in all studied subjects compared to those cultivated in good quality soil. Besides commonly used Fv/Fm (potential photosynthetic efficiency) and P.I. (performance index), which showed very low sensitivity, we suggest other fluorescence parameters (like dissipation, DIo/RC) for revealing finer differences. We can conclude that measurement of leaf fluorescence is a suitable method for revealing stress affecting Mxg in poor soils. However, none of investigated parameters proved significant positive effect of PGRs on stress reduction. Therefore, direct improvement of soil quality by fertilization should be considered for stress reduction and improving the biomass quality in this type of soils. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Most on-road vehicles today are powered by internal combustion engines, which are, in most cases, burning petroleum-derived liquid fuels mixed with bio-components. The power to weight ratio of internal combustion engines combined with the high energy content of conventional fuels, which can be refilled easily in matter of minutes, makes them ideal for all kinds of road transportation. Since the introduction of EURO emissions norms, the emissions from the Transport sector in the European Union have undergone significant reduction. There are several alternatives to fossil fuels with similar properties, which can replace their usage in the transport sector. The production of biofuels is usually energy more intensive than production of fossil fuels, but their usage can contribute to emission reduction in the transport sector. In recent years, a lot of effort was also put into promotion of electric vehicles as zero emissions vehicles. With the decrease of greenhouse gas emissions in the electricity production sector, and with the increase of battery capacity, the role of electric vehicles in the transport sector will probably increase. Despite significant research and financial investments in electric vehicles development, the transport sector in near future will be mostly powered by internal combustion engines and petroleum-derived liquid fuels. The amount of pollution from transport sector will be further regulated with stricter emission norms combined with smaller amount of alternative fuel usage.

AB  - The increased wastes in the agricultural sector is a domino effect of population growth and the growing demand for food that have put pressure on the agricultural and livestock farming sectors for more production. Biomass is currently a major source for replacing fossil fuels driven by their future depletion and current environmental impacts as a result of their unbridled consumption. Anaerobic digestion of biomass is a known technology effective in producing gaseous biofuels. The study comprehensively reviews the potential of producing gaseous biofuels from agricultural residues including sugarcane, apple, sugarbeet, wheat, potato, rice, barley, alfalfa, grapes, corn, and dates and also from animal wastes including livestock and poultry manure and slaughterhouse wastes (e.g., blood and rumen) in Khuzestan Province, as the hub of Iranian agriculture. These wastes are a known concern of farmers and cannot be put to proper use. One of the best ways to use the above-mentioned wastes is to turn them into biofuels such as biogas. The study results revealed that agricultural wastes could produce over 830 million m3 of biogas, 400 million liters of biobutanol, and 345 million m3 of biohydrogen. The livestock farming sector of Khuzestan is also capable of producing 6 million tons of livestock feces and 0.34 million tons of chicken manure that can be the feedstock for producing 380 million m3 of gaseous biofuel. In addition, slaughterhouse wastes are also another source that can produce around 1030 million m3 of biogas. According to the results, by managing wastes both from the agricultural and livestock sectors in this province, the potential of biogas production can be used for generation of more than 4 TW/year of electricity. The findings of the present investigation could assist policy-makers in making decisions aimed at taking advantage of these renewable resources. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Transnational private sustainability governance, such as eco-certification, does not operate in a regulatory or jurisdictional vacuum. A public authority may intervene in private governance for various reasons, including to improve private governance's efficient functioning or to assert public regulatory primacy. This article argues that to properly understand the nature of public-private governance interactions—whether more competitive or complementary—we need to disaggregate a public authority's intervention. The article distinguishes between four features of private governance in which a public authority can intervene: standard setting, procedural aspects, supply chain signaling, and compliance incentives. Using the cases of the European Union's policies on organic agriculture and biofuels production, the article shows that public-private governance interaction dynamics vary across these private governance features as well as over time. Furthermore, the analysis highlights the importance of active lobbying by private governance actors in influencing these dynamics and the resulting policy outputs. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd

AB  - In order to partially replace the use of fossil fuels in the aeronautical sector, it is proposed to produce FAMEtype biofuels from palm kernel oil. Short chain methyl esters can be used so that the FAME biodiesel have no significant effects on the cold properties of the Jet Fuels when these are mixtures. In this sense, a study of the production of biodiesel FAME from palm kernel by transesterification oil at bench scale was carried out using a batch reactor with the optimal value of the process conditions that were obtained in a previous work but at laboratory level. In that research, the input variables were the methanol-oil ratio, the temperature and the amount of catalyst (% KOH). In this work, the response variable was on the production yield of methyl esters, which were analysed by GC. Physicochemical characterization of the generated biodiesel and an economic analysis of the bank-scale process was carried out to envision a future implementation in the Colombian Air force. Using additives, the improvement of the cold flow properties (such as freezing point and cloud point) of mixtures of FAME of Palm Kernel Oil with Jet Fuel A1 can be contemplated. © 2020, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - The biomass-to-liquid (BtL) process is a promising technology to obtain clean, liquid, second-generation biofuels and chemicals. The BtL process, which comprises several steps, is based upon the gasification of biomass and the catalytic transformation of the syngas that is obtained via the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) reaction, producing a hydrocarbon pool known as syncrude. The FTS process is a well-established technology, and there are currently very large FTS plants operating worldwide that produce liquid fuels and hydrocarbons from natural gas (NG) (gas-to-liquids, GtL process) and coal (coal-to-liquids, CtL process). Due to the limited availability of local biomass, the size of the BtL plants should be downscaled compared to that of a GtL or CtL plant. Since the feasibility of the XtL (X refers to any energy source that can be converted to liquid, including coal, NG, biomass, municipal solid waste, etc.) processes is strongly influenced by the economies of scale, the viability of small-scale BtL plants can be compromised. An interesting approach to overcome this issue is to increase the productivity of the FTS process by developing reactors and catalysts with higher productivities to generate the desired product fraction. Recently, by integrating membrane reactors with the FTS process the gas feeding and separation unit have been demonstrated in a single reactor. In this review, the most significant achievements in the field of catalytic membrane reactors for the FTS process will be discussed. Different types of membranes and configurations of membrane reactors, including H2O separation and H2-feed distribution, among others, will be analyzed. ©2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020.

AB  - Biodiesel is a clean and renewable fuel, which is considered as the best alternative to diesel fuel, but the feedstock contributes more than 70% of the cost. The most important constituent essential for biodiesel development is to explore cheap feedstock with high oil content. In this work, we found novel non-edible plant seeds of Koelreuteria paniculata (KP) with high oil contents of 28-30 wt.% and low free fatty acid contents (0.91%), which can serve as a promising feedstock for biodiesel production. KP seed oil can convert into biodiesel/fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) by base-catalyzed transesterification with the highest biodiesel production of 95.2% after an optimization process. We obtained the optimal transesterification conditions, i.e., oil/methanol ratio (6:1), catalyst concentration (0.32), reaction temperature (65 °C), stirring rate (700 rpm), and reaction time (80 min). The physico-chemical properties and composition of the FAME were investigated and compared with mineral diesel. The synthesized esters were confirmed and characterized by the application of NMR (1H and 13C), FTIR, and GC-MS. The biofuel produced from KP seed oil satisfies the conditions verbalized by ASTM D6751 and EN14214 standards. Accordingly, KP source oil can be presented as a novel raw material for biofuel fabrication. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Managing of wastes rich in lignocellulose creates the opportunity to produce biofuels that are in full compliance with the principles of sustainable development. Biomass, as a suitable base for the production of biofuels, does not have to be standardized, and its only important feature is the appropriate content of lignocellulose, which assures great freedom in the selection of input. Biobutanol, obtained from this type of biomass, can be used as fuel for internal combustion engines, including diesel engines. In the era of strict environmental protection regulations, especially concerning atmospheric air, any new fuel, apart from good energetic properties, should also show beneficial ecological effects. This study investigates the carbon dioxide emissions from biobutanol powered diesel engine by means of use of the simulation model. The parameters of a real passenger car powered by a diesel engine were used for simulation carried out accordingly to the WLTP (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure) approval procedure as the current test for newly manufactured cars. The results obtained for biobutanol were compared with simulated exhaust emissions obtained for conventional diesel and with FAME (fatty acid methyl esters)—the most popular biofuel. Biobutanol, in spite of its higher consumption, showed lower direct carbon dioxide emissions than both: the conventional diesel and FAME. In addition, a LCA (life cycle assessment) was carried out for the fuels and vehicles in question using the SimaPro package. Therefore, the implementation of butyl alcohol as a fuel provides favorable environmental effects. This result gives arguments towards biofuel production management indicating that implementation of biobutanol production technology mitigates carbon dioxide emission, as well as promotes lignocellulosic resources rather than edible parts of the plants. © 2020 by the authors

AB  - Thermal conductivity of two types of nanobiodiesels (NBs) was investigated theoretically and experimentally. The first type of NBs (C4-Au) was composed of C4 biodiesel (purchased from Biofuels of Mexico) filled with Au nanoparticles (Au-NPs) and the second type (SB-Ag) was composed of soybean biodiesel (SB) filled with Ag nanoparticles (Ag-NPs). It has been demonstrated in the literature that the addition of Au-NPs or Ag-NPs to biodiesel can lead to a significant increase in thermal properties. The photothermal techniques were used to determine the thermal diffusivity (D), thermal effusivity (e), and thermal conductivity (k) of biodiesel filled with Au-NPs or Ag-NPs for different concentrations. For about two decades, researchers have made the effort to predict the enhancement of the thermal conductivity of nanofluids based on experiments and several theoretical models have been proposed. One of these analytical models, which have allowed researchers to calculate the thermal conductivity of the nanofluids, is the Hamilton–Crosser Model. This model is based on the classical theory of compounds and mixtures containing particles in the order of millimeters or micrometers and fails dramatically in predicting the thermal conductivity of nanofluids. In that sense, the Hamilton–Crosser model (H–C) cannot represent adequately the enhancement in k as a function of NP’s concentration. Then, the artificial neural network (ANN) modeling method was used to predict the thermal conductivity of the two NBs studied in this work. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - High-quality bio-fuel (low oxygen content and acid value, high calorific value) was produced by catalytic pyrolysis of clay oil over calcined clay. Both feedstock (clay oil) and catalyst (calcined clay) were obtained from spent bleaching clay (SBC) deriving out of edible oil plants. The calcined clay was characterized with inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), N2 adsorption/desorption analyses, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), temperature programmed desorption of ammonia and carbon dioxide (NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD). Catalytic pyrolysis experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of several parameters on the product distribution, including pyrolysis temperature, weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) and residence time. The optimal conditions for produce high quality bio-fuel were 550 °C with WHSV of 2.5 h−1 and residence time of 1.65 s. The low heating value of bio-oil was increased by 13%–46.36 kJ/g, as long as the acid value was decreased by 97% to 1.16 mg/g KOH. The calcined clay catalyst showed slight deactivation after 4 cycles. Therefore, fast pyrolysis process is a rapid and efficient method of valorising spent bleaching clay from waste oils for high quality bio-fuel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

Spectrophotometric methods can be used for the quantification of mixtures of oils, associated with chemometric tools, enabling the analysis of overlapping signals. The aim of this work was to apply the multivariate calibration with PLS (partial least squares) and artificial neural network (ANN), to estimate the concentration of esters in the transesterification of soybean oil using molecular absorption spectrophotometry as analytical technique. The absorbance measurements were performed in a spectrophotometer UV/VIS. Synthetic solutions were prepared with standards of the five major compounds of soybean biodiesel and the real samples were obtained by the reaction of transesterification of soybean oil with two types of catalysts: NaOH and enzymatic method using Lipozyme® IM (Novozymes). According to the results, all components of the reaction medium absorb in the wavelength range of 190-280 nm. The reactions of the basic catalysis reached conversions close to 100%, whereas the enzymatic reactions reached lower conversion values. For both methods, the calibration and validation groups were composed, respectively, by the synthetic and the real samples. Results showed that the concentrations of esters estimated by the ANN model in the real samples are more accurate (R2 of 0.93), showing the great ability of the ANN in estimating the data. © 2020, Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana Iztapalapa.

AB  - Oil extraction from kernels requires an appreciable amount of energy that could be decreased when the purpose of this oil is to produce biodiesel by intensifying the oil extraction and transesterification steps. The qualities of biodiesels obtained from Calophyllum inophyllum oilseeds resulting from variation in the seeds drying process under optimized conditions in an in situ acid catalyzed transesterification of the oil using n-hexane and methanol was evaluated in the present study. Oils of freshly pulverised seeds that were dried under different conditions were used for biodiesel productions through extractive reaction method. The drying process/condition is observed to have influenced the quantity and quality of the biodiesel obtained with parameters such as the free fatty acids (FFA) content, cloud and pour points of the oil considerably affected. Biodiesel from oven-dried kernels at 75 °C and 105 °C without removal of their husks met both ASTM and EN specifications. The study concluded that the optimized conditions adopted yielded biodiesel of very high quality from Calophyllum inophyllum seeds that could serve as a better non-edible oil substitute for biodiesel fuels production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The reduction of energy sources, environmental and destructive pollution caused by the combustion of fossil fuels and urban sewage wastes, has created a situation that researchers are thinking about a solution to two problems simultaneously. There are several processes for converting sewage sludge to energy. Pyrolysis is considered one of the processes of interest. The products obtained and the characteristics of each product depend on the pyrolysis operating factors, such as temperature, residence time, heating rate, specifications of the reactor, and the catalyst. The amount of oxygen and water in bio-oils is high and its viscosity is high, therefore are unstable in terms of oxidation. Therefore, it is necessary to improve it. Most liquid bio-oil products are obtained when the bio-char production is minimized. This is done at high temperatures and heating rate temperatures around 1000 °C/S with rapid cooling. Fluidized bed reactors are the most economically suitable reactors for rapid pyrolysis of sewage sludge with high bio-oil production efficiency. The cost of raw materials is 80% of the total cost of bio-oil production, so, the use of sewage sludge as feed for the pyrolysis process to produce bio-oil reduces its cost and makes its production economically competitive with fossil diesel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study demonstrated a novel approach of lipids extraction with simultaneous biofuels conversion on microalgae Chlorella sorokiniana CY-1 cultivation using waste molasses as culture medium. The lipid extraction process was based on a hybrid liquid biphasic system (HLBS) which comprises of disruptive and extractive solvents in a single system. The microalgae cultivation with waste molasses showed a reduction in the chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solid (TSS) and nitrate content on the waste medium (61.48 %, 63.94 % and 63.79 %, respectively). Additionally, a prompt lipids extraction with a recovery of 92.84 % and a cell disruption enhancement of 8.3-fold in the organic solvent phase was attained. The acid-treated C. sorokiniana CY-1 biomass showed a composition of carbon at 61.3 %, oxygen at 33.2 %, nitrogen at 5.5 % and potassium at 0.12 %. Sulphur content was not detected in the microalgae biomass and this had aided the production of fatty acids methyl ester (FAME) which was observed by a gas chromatographic-flame ionisation detector (GC-FID) profile. A disruptive-extraction method using acid assisted phase on HLBS showed potential for direct conversion of lipids into FAME to produce biofuels for engine combustion. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, the effect of hydrogen addition to a compression ignition (CI) engine fueled with the diesel fuel-waste cooking oil biodiesel (WCOB) blend (B25) on the engine performance, and exhaust emissions was examined experimentally. In the tests, a four-cylinder, four-stroke, water-cooled, 1.461-L, turbocharged CI engine was used. The engine tests were performed at the fixed engine speed of 1750 rpm and at the diverse engine loads of 40, 60 and 80 Nm. The hydrogen was added to the intake air at the flow rates of 10, 20, 30 and 40 lpm. According to the results obtained, hydrogen had a positive effect on break specific fuel consumption (BSFC) for all test conditions. The increase occurred at the exhaust gas temperatures (EGTs) and cylinder pressures (CPs) with hydrogen addition. The NOx and total hydrocarbon (THC) emissions decreased with the hydrogen addition until 30 lpm at 40 and 60 Nm engine loads. On the other hand, they increased at 80 Nm engine load for all hydrogen additions. While CO2 and O2 emissions decreased with the hydrogen addition, the smoke emissions increased. It was found that the value of 30 lpm was the optimum condition of the hydrogen addition rates. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Due to its substantial lipid content, leather tanning waste (LTW) is regarded as a potential feedstock for the waste-derived biodiesel. To promote the valorization of LTW, one-pot synthesis of biodiesel via supercritical ethanol method was investigated. The influence of the three independent reaction variables, namely reaction time t (10, 20, 30, 40, 50 min), temperature T (300, 350, 400 °C) and ethanol to LTW molar ratio reo (35, 40, 45), on the yield of fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) YF was studied. The multilevel factorial design combined with the response surface methodology and three-way analysis of variance was employed to design and optimize the experiment in regards to the three independent variables. Based on the optimization results, the highest FAEE yield was predicted at 99.68% when t = 47.4 min, T = 374.6 °C, and reo = 40.02. The actual FAEE yield was experimentally obtained at 98.91 ± 0.31% using the optimized reaction conditions. A deviation of 0.77% in the experimental verification shows a satisfactory agreement between the actual and predicted YF. All reaction variables were also found to give a significant effect on the yield of FAEE. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae as an alternative feedstock for biodiesel production has achieved attention because of increasing fuel demand, climate change as well as global warming. For this purpose, 41 local microalgae strains belonging to 5 different phyla having the capability of best survival in climatic conditions were isolated from aquatic sources. The selection of most robust strains (C. vulgaris, S. dimorphus, S. obliquus, Selenastrum sp, and C. humicola) was based on biomass and lipid productivity. The microalgae C. vulgaris had highest performance in terms of biomass in BG-11 medium (1.86 ± 0.1 g/L) as compared to wastewater (1.14 ± 0.3 g/L) followed by S. obliquus. Moreover, the highest lipid contents were obtained in heterotrophic conditions (35.1 ± 1.0%) in C. vulgaris and the overall lipid productivity was high in mixotrophic condition because of high biomass contents. The extracted oil was analyzed for fatty acid contents and the strains S. dimorphus and S. obliquus have high contents of saturated fatty acids (SFA, 63.67% and 63.60%, respectively). Whereas, C. vulgaris has high amount of monounsaturated fatty acids, saturated ones and (MUFA 81.28%) as well as low polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA 18.72%) are the factors that make this high quality biodiesel a strong competitor of fossil fuels. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biobutanol produced by acetone-biobutanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation process has been revisited in the light of its use as “drop in” liquid biofuel to be blended with gasoline. In this study, renewable feedstock like rice straw, sugarcane bagasse and microalgal hydrolysate were used in ABE fermentation via separate hydrolysis and fermentation. Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 was used as the fermenting organism. Alkali pretreatment followed by enzymatic hydrolysis was used for rice straw and sugarcane bagasse. In batch fermentation, a biobutanol titer and yield of 9.10 g/L and 0.42 mol/mol glucose (0.17 g biobutanol/g glucose), respectively was obtained from rice straw, while sugarcane bagasse achieved a biobutanol titer and yield of 8.40 g/L and 0.40 mol/mol glucose (0.16 g biobutanol/g glucose), respectively. Higher microalgal biomass loading with 3% acid pretreatment severely inhibited fermentation performance. Unhydrolyzed microalgal biomass at a loading of 180 g/L in ABE fermentation resulted in 4.32 g/L biobutanol and 0.09 g biobutanol/g microalgae as yield. C. acetobutylicum was immobilized in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) for improving the cell loading in fermentation and protect the cells from biobutanol toxicity. With rice straw hydrolysate as a feedstock and in the absence of yeast extract, a biobutanol titer, yield and productivity of 13.80 g/L, 0.90 g/L/h, and 0.58 mol biobutanol/mol glucose (0.23 g biobutanol/g glucose), respectively were obtained. Hence, rice straw is a potential feedstock for biobutanol production for fuel use. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Compared with bioethanol, biobutanol with higher energy density and lower vapor pressure is more suitable as a fuel for motor engines. However, the typical low acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) concentration hinders the competitiveness of biobutanol because of 1-butanol tolerance. In addition, the dehydration of 1-butanol involves the separation of 1-butanol + water heterogeneous azeotrope, which was usually achieved in a two-column distillation + decantation system. A new process based on the determination of the salt + 1-butanol + water system was proposed to separate biobutanol from a 1-butanol + water system. The salting out resulted in the formation of an organic solvent-rich phase and an aqueous phase. All the 1-butanol in the water-rich phase was recovered to the organic phase, and most of the water in the 1-butanol-rich phase was attracted to the aqueous phase by the salting-out effects of the electrolytes, namely potassium carbonate, dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, tripotassium phosphate, and potassium pyrophosphate. This effect produces a top phase containing greater than 97% salt-free 1-butanol. The salting-out effect, the solubility, and the solvation effect of an electrolyte play essential roles in the separation of 1-butanol. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The mitigation of climate change poses a major challenge to the legal framework which aims to stimulate the development of renewable energy sources. The European Union’s direction for the use of renewable energy is distributed generation and an increased use of by-products and organic waste, especially in the production of next-generation biofuels. The main aim of this study is to evaluate the production potential of straw in Poland and the possibility of its use for energy purposes, including a forecast for 2030, on the assumption that the management of this resource is in accordance with the provisions of the Polish Code for Good Agriculture Practice. In Poland, in the years 1999–2018, the average annual surplus of straw harvested over agricultural consumption equalled 12.5 million tons (4.2 Mtoe). Its largest surpluses were in the Dolno´ slaskie, Kujawsko-Pomorskie, Lubelskie, Wielkopolskie, and Zachodniopomorskie voivodeships (NUTS2). Based on the developed panel models, forecasts for straw surpluses in Poland are presented in three perspectives: realistic, pessimistic, and optimistic. The forecasts show regional differentiation until 2030. Each of the three perspectives indicate a slow increase in these surpluses, and depending on the adopted version, it will range from 10.6% to 21.9%. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Scenedesmus obliquus, a green microalga of the class Chlorophyceae, has been used to produce biofuels. However, limited research has been reported on platform chemicals that use microalgae as biomass to replace fossil sources. This paper reports on the investigation of levulinic acid (LA) production from lipid-extracted S. obliquus with an acid-catalyzed thermochemical conversion using a statistical experimental approach. For the reaction factors, the highest effect on LA yield resulted from catalyst concentration. The optimized LA yield of 45.63 wt% (70.7 mol%) was achieved with 5 wt% lipid-extracted microalgae and reaction factors of 0.85 M HCl as a catalyst at 180 °C for 10 min. Also, the LA yield as a function of the combined severity factor followed a sigmoid curve. High LA yield resulted from combined severity factors greater than 3.4. These results indicate that the production of platform chemicals may be possible using microalgae feedstocks and thermochemical conversion. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The need for thermal regulation in microalgal photobioreactors is a significant impediment to their large-scale adoption. The energy costs associated with thermal regulation alone can easily result in a negative energy balance. Self-sustaining photovoltaic powered photobioreactors that do not require cooling systems provide an opportunity to maximize biomass productivity, generate local electricity, reduce thermal regulation requirements, and significantly improve the energy balance of the system. Net energy analysis of a spectrally-selective, insulated-glazed photovoltaic photobioreactor (IGP) with an integrated capability for renewable electricity generation used to cultivate Nannochloropsis sp. without freshwater-based cooling resulted in a net energy ratio of 2.96, a figure comparable to agricultural bio-oil crops such as Jatropha and soybean. Experimental data from pilot-scale operation of this novel photobioreactor producing Nannochloropsis biomass under outdoor conditions was extrapolated to a 1-ha IGP installation. Annual biomass productivity reached 66.0-tons dry weight ha−1, equivalent to overall energy output of 1696.2 GJ ha−1. The integrated semi-transparent photovoltaic panels generated an additional 1126.8 GJ ha−1 yr−1 (313.0 MWh ha−1 yr−1). Energy demands from plant building materials, machinery, fertilizers, plant operations, and biomass harvesting constituted total energy input with a combined value of 707.3 GJ ha−1 yr−1. Comparison with a conventional photobioreactor requiring passive evaporative cooling showed novel photobioreactor had a 73% greater net energy ratio. Nannochloropsis cultivation in IGP system ensured co-production of lipid and protein of 34.7 and 25.7-tons ha−1 yr−1, respectively. These results suggest that this novel photobioreactor could be a viable and sustainable biomass production technology for mass microalgal cultivation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Rubber (Hevea brasilienis) is a plantation crop grown in various regions of India. It is a non-edible oil source and has excellent potential for being a biodiesel feedstock. The major problem with crude rubber seed oil is its high free fatty acid (FFA) content (37.46%). The present study has used the Box-Behnken response surface method to minimize the FFA content of the oil. FFA content of 1.31% was obtained with alcohol to oil molar ratio of 6.652:1 and 0.5 wt% of H2SO4 catalyst at a reaction temperature of 63.75 °C in 50 min. The results of engine testing indicated a decrease in fuel consumption by 50.23% for RB10 and 47.74% for RB20 when compared with neat diesel. The thermal efficiency was reduced by 12.16% for RB10 and 14.74% for RB20. The emission analysis revealed that HC emissions were increased by 22.3% for RB10 and by 41.72% for RB20. There was a decrease in NOx emissions by 21.5% for RB10 and by 21.7% for RB20 while the CO2 emissions were reduced by 46.3% for RB10 and 49.54% for RB20 at full loading. The CO emissions were increased by 25% and 37.5% for RB10 and, respectively, when compared with diesel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Presently, sugarcane bagasse (SB) and oat hulls (OH) have a distinctive potential as a renewable source of biomass, due to its global availability, which is advantageous for producing liquid and gaseous fuels by thermochemical processes. Thermo-Catalytic Reforming (TCR) is a pyrolysis based technology for generating energy vectors (char, bio-oil and syngas) from biomass wastes. This work aims to study the conversion of SB and OH into fuels, using TCR in a 2 kg/h continuous pilot-scale reactor at different pyrolysis temperatures. The pyrolysis temperatures were studied at 400, 450 and 500 °C, while the subsequent reforming temperature remained constant at 500 °C. The bio-oil contained the highest calorific value of 33.4 and 33.5 MJ/kg for SB and OH, respectively at 500 °C pyrolysis temperature, which represented a notable increase compared to the raw material calorific value of SB and OH (16.4 and 16.0 MJ/kg, respectively), this was the result of deoxygenation reactions occurring. Furthermore, the increment of the pyrolysis temperature improved the water content, total acid number (TAN), viscosity and density of the bio-oil. The syngas and the biochar properties did not change significantly with the increase of the pyrolysis temperature. In order to use TCR bio-oil as an engine fuel, it is necessary to carry out some upgrading treatments; or blend it with fossil fuels if it is to be used as a transportation fuel. Overall, TCR is a promising future route for the valorisation of lignocellulosic residues to produce energy vectors. © 2020 Energy Institute

AB  - Medium-chain fatty alcohols (MCFOHs, C6 to C12) are potential substitutes for fossil fuels, such as diesel and jet fuels, and have wide applications in various manufacturing processes. While today MCFOHs are mainly sourced from petrochemicals or plant oils, microbial biosynthesis represents a scalable, reliable, and sustainable alternative. Here, we aim to establish a Saccharomyces cerevisiae platform capable of selectively producing MCFOHs. This was enabled by tailoring the properties of a bacterial carboxylic acid reductase from Mycobacterium marinum (MmCAR). Extensive protein engineering, including directed evolution, structure-guided semirational design, and rational design, was implemented. MmCAR variants with enhanced activity were identified using a growth-coupled high-throughput screening assay relying on the detoxification of the enzyme’s substrate, medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs). Detailed characterization demonstrated that both the specificity and catalytic activity of MmCAR was successfully improved and a yeast strain harboring the best MmCAR variant generated 2.8-fold more MCFOHs than the strain expressing the unmodified enzyme. Through deletion of the native MCFA exporter gene TPO1, MCFOH production was further improved, resulting in a titer of 252 mg/L for the final strain, which represents a significant improvement in MCFOH production in minimal medium by S. cerevisiae. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Sulfur-free Ni–W/Al2O3 catalysts synthesized through incipient wetness impregnation technique were investigated in deoxygenation of methyl palmitate and ethyl caprate blend at 300 °C and P = 1 MPa (PH2 = 0.25 MPa) in a fixed-bed continuous flow reactor. Modification of Ni/Al2O3 catalysts by W (0.4–4.4 wt%) was found to give rise to higher both conversions of the feedstock and deoxygenation degree. In addition, this also resulted in a change in the selectivity of deoxygenation towards alkanes formed via direct hydrodeoxygenation route, compared to alkanes formed through decarboxylation/decarbonylation. Selectivity by alkanes with carbon chain length equal to those of an initial fatty acid formed via hydrodeoxygenation was found to increase with W content increasing. The synthesized catalysts were investigated by XRD, XPS, TEM, BET and H2-TPR techniques. According to XPS study of the reduced samples, tungsten was in 6+ oxidation state on the sample surface and W6+ content increased in the near-surface layer of samples with tungsten content increasing in catalysts. © 2020

AB  - In the present work, biofuels produced from agricultural waste have been proposed as a substitute for petroleum-based fuel. Biodiesel produced from waste vegetable oil has been used alongside hexanol in a reactivity controlled compression ignition engine. The waste vegetable oil biodiesel was prepared by trans-esterification and was directly injected inside the cylinder. Hexanol was injected into the port during early suction stroke. A modified 1-cylinder water-cooled diesel engine was used for the tests. The modified engine was tested at medium load and rated load for injection pressures of 400, 500 and 600 bar. The proportion of hexanol to waste vegetable oil biodiesel was also varied to find the optimal combination. The results were mapped and analyzed with diesel operation at similar conditions. A maximum increase of 1.5% in thermal efficiency was observed compared to Diesel. Oxides of nitrogen and smoke emissions reduced simultaneously for biodiesel-hexanol combinations compared to diesel. Injection pressure of 500 bar and hexanol proportion of 30% at medium load and 60% at rated load were found to be optimum concerning lowest emissions. This study proposes that waste vegetable oil biodiesel and hexanol combination in reactivity controlled compression ignition mode can be an effective replacement for conventional fossil fuel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Three advanced biofuels, namely HVO (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil), a glycerol-derived biofuel (Mo·bio) and biodiesel from oil industry wastes, were tested in a Euro 6 diesel vehicle equipped with a Lean NOx Trap under the worldwide harmonized light-duty vehicles test cycle (WLTC) at warm (24 °C) and cold (−7 °C) ambient temperature. HVO was tested pure, biodiesel was used both pure and blended at 20% (v/v) with a reference diesel fuel and Mo·bio was also blended with the diesel fuel at the same ratio. In order to analyse the sensitivity of the gaseous emissions and the aftertreatment efficiency to the type of fuel, emissions were measured upstream and downstream of the aftertreatment system and fuel-associated effects were isolated from those of the engine operating conditions (EGR rate, injection strategy and equivalence ratio). The energy consumption was not very different between fuels, although HVO led to a higher engine efficiency while biodiesel behaved oppositely at the low speed phase. Regarding NOx emissions, no differences were found between fuels while cold temperature led to higher NOx because of the lower EGR rate and the use of only high pressure EGR. Biodiesel and Mo·bio improved CO and THC engine-out emissions at warm temperature, but these compounds were deteriorated at low ambient conditions because of the poorer viscosity and volatility of these fuels. The DOC efficiency was higher for CO than for THC excepting the low speed phase, for which deposition of high molecular weight hydrocarbons could mask the results. The LNT efficiency was lower at cold conditions because of the high NOx engine-out emissions. Differences between fuels were only observed in the case of the DOC and during the engine warm-up period. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Different titanium (Ti) sources modified HZSM-5 coupled with dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) were applied to upgrade biomass-derived vapors to prepare bio-fuels. Four objectives were included: (I) effects of different Ti species on active radicals were investigated, (II) effects of Ti sources on bio-fuel yield and properties were analyzed, (III) the availabilities of bio-fuels were evaluated from different composition angles, and (IV) the catalyst stabilities were characterized on different scales. The results showed that the interaction between low-valent titanium species and DBD could increase radicals. The rutile modification (TiRH5) had no positive effect on bio-fuel production, while the anatase modification (TiAH5) could induce photo-catalysis by coupling with DBD to increase both the yield (17.26%) and high heating value (HHV) (35.56 MJ/kg). The low-valent Ti modification (Ti3H5) further increased the yield to 17.77% and HHV to 36.47 MJ/kg, benefiting from the MAHs increase and the integration of more hydrogen-radicals under multiple interactions, while the conventional titanium dioxide (TiO2) modification (Ti4H5) lacked the catalytic effects. The bio-fuel from TiAH5 catalysis had potential for producing gasoline additives or substitutes, while the bio-fuel from Ti3H5 catalysis tended to become diesel additives or substitutes. The induced photo-catalysis and multiple interactions improved the stabilities of TiAH5 and Ti3H5, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Despite the increasing interest in upgrading biomass-derived molecules to value-added products, the electrochemical conversion of biomass platform chemicals to highly valuable biofuels, such as jet fuel, has not yet received wide attention. Herein, we report a catalyst-free electrochemical route for the production of a jet fuel precursor, hydrofuroin, from the electrohydrodimerization of furfural, which can be readily derived from lignocellulose and already has an industrial production of 300 000 tons per year. Detailed electrochemical studies using carbon and copper electrodes at various pH values enabled us to probe the reduction mechanism of furfural and obtain the kinetic details, such as the diffusion constant and electron transfer rate. Preparative electrolysis in a batch electrolyzer achieved a high yield of hydrofuroin (94%) with an excellent faradaic efficiency of 93%. Finally, a flow electrolyzer was employed to demonstrate the great promise of large-scale production of hydrofuroin from the electrohydrodimerization of furfural.

AB  - The production of biofuels in Sweden has increased significantly in the past years in order to reduce fossil fuel dependence and mitigate climate impacts. Nonetheless, current methodological guidelines for assessing the GHG savings from the use of biofuels do not fully account for benefits from by-products and other utilities (e.g. waste heat and electricity) from biofuel production. This study therefore reviews the aggregated environmental performance of these multi-functional biofuel systems by assessing impacts and benefits from relevant production processes in Sweden in order to improve the decision base for biofuel producers and policymakers in the transition to a bio-based and circular economy. This was done by (1) conducting a mapping of the Swedish biofuel production portfolio, (2) developing future production scenarios, and (3) application of life cycle assessment methodology to assess the environmental performance of the production processes. Special focus was provided to review the potential benefits from replacing conventional products and services with by-products and utilities. The results provide evidence that failure to account for non-fuel-related benefits from biofuel production leads to an underestimation of the contribution of biofuels to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts when replacing fossil fuels, showing the importance of their multi-functionality. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The evaporation and micro-explosion characteristics of biodiesel/n-propanol blended droplets at 573, 673 and 773 K ambient temperatures are studied using high-speed backlight imaging technique. The results show that the droplet evaporation is relatively stable at 573 K. However, micro-explosions occur at 673 and 773 K, the micro-explosion intensity increases with ambient temperature. The calculated superheat limit of n-propanol is 490 K. The blended droplet micro-explosion occurrence time is associated with the n-propanol concentration. The lower content of n-propanol, the earlier blended droplet micro-explosion occurs, and vice versa. The micro-explosion intensity and evaporation rate of the blended droplet first increase and then decrease as the n-propanol concentration increases. The micro-explosion delay time of the blended droplet first decreases and then increases with the increase of n-propanol concentration. Interestingly, the micro-explosion intensity, evaporation rate and micro-explosion delay time of droplet all reach the optimum value when the n-propanol concentration is 50%. Moreover, the oil membrane formation mechanisms of the soluble blended droplet with two different blended structures (n-propanol in biodiesel and biodiesel in n-propanol) are proposed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel has been widely considered as an alternative fuel for aircraft and power generation turbine engines, but experimentation in literature is mostly limited to microturbines and technological challenges remain open regarding its sustainability. The present study publishes the experimental methodology and the obtained results of testing a full-scale turbojet engine J69-T-25A using blends of JetA1 and palm oil biodiesel with volume contents from 0% to 50%. An increased biodiesel FAME substitution and extended data analysis yields new findings. Biodiesel substitution up to 50% v/v drops the thrust force by 26,6% and raises the fuel consumption by 10,8%, causing a detriment in the efficiency near 76,3%. Albeit poor atomization is noticed, the rise in the excess air of combustion diminishes the CO and HC emissions. An optimum trade-off value of 15,8% of biodiesel volume content is found to avoid a significant reduction of efficiency and acceleration time, driving to a slight reduction in the GHG-emissions and a raise of 25% in the fuel costs. The employment of a biodiesel content above 30% harms the ignition at the start-up procedure of the engine and fosters cloudiness development at the exhaust gases during the shutdown. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The commercial cultivation of microalgae began in the 1960s and Chlorella was one of the first target organisms. The species has long been considered a potential source of renewable energy, an alternative for phytoremediation, and more recently, as a growth and immune stimulant. However, Chlorella vulgaris, which is one of the most studied microalga, has never been comprehensively profiled chemically. In the present study, comprehensive profiling of the Chlorella vulgaris metabolome grown under normal culture conditions was carried out, employing tandem LC-MS/MS to profile the ethanolic extract and GC-MS for fatty acid analysis. The fatty acid profile of C. vulgaris was shown to be rich in omega-6,-7,-9, and-13 fatty acids, with omega-6 being the highest, representing more than sixty percent (>60%) of the total fatty acids. This is a clear indication that this species of Chlorella could serve as a good source of nutrition when incorporated in diets. The profile also showed that the main fatty acid composition was that of C16-C18 (>92%), suggesting that it might be a potential candidate for biodiesel production. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed carotenoid constituents comprising violaxanthin, neoxanthin, lutein, β-carotene, vulgaxanthin I, astaxanthin, and antheraxanthin, along with other pigments such as the chlorophylls. In addition to these, amino acids, vitamins, and simple sugars were also profiled, and through mass spectrometry-based molecular networking, 48 phospholipids were putatively identified. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - This study tried to optimize the solar collector working fluid by hybrid nanoparticles in order to increase efficiency and decrease costs of biodiesel production following the fabrication of the parabolic trough solar collector and formation of the hybrid system of solar collector/desalination/conversion reactor by deploying biomass conversion reactor along with the solar collector. Therefore, after designing the experiment based on the nanoparticle concentration in the fluid, the hybrid nanoparticles weight ratio and the collector fluid flow rate, the nanofluid containing carbon nanotube and MgO (with 25:75 wt ratio) and nanoparticle mass percentage of 0.336 in the base fluid with flow rate of 2.5 L/min were selected as the optimum nanofluid. Under optimum condition, the operating cost of the collector improvement was $169 and 81 cents per year, and its thermal efficiency was 56.59%. Then, we used transesterification and produced biodiesel by heating the parabolic solar collector and using palm/rapeseed biomasses and chlorella microalgae at 60 °C. The conversion percentage of biomass into biodiesel for each of the palm, rapeseed and, chlorella species were 76.31, 74.54, and 81.4, respectively. Moreover, the cost of biomass conversion into biodiesel for palm, rapeseed, and chlorella species was $0.73, $0.54, and $1.27, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Carbon mitigation options have been measured neglecting the role that fossil fuels play as energy sources. For instance, producing wood or storing carbon would not have a cyclical effect on energy supply. This study suggests an approach to measure the carbon offset of biofuels, regarding the concept of exergy on carbon mitigation and the area required to provide the equivalent amount of exergy from fossil fuels. Sugarcane and eucalyptus were considered as mitigation alternatives within five distinct scenarios for biofuel production in a broad technological range. All scenarios were compared with four fossil fuels: diesel oil, pure gasoline, and two gasoline-ethanol blends. In general, sugarcane presented smaller specific exergy, but higher exergy output than eucalyptus, on average for all scenarios, mainly due to its higher yearly crop yield. On average, both crops require from 20% to 30% more area to synthesize the same amount of exergy than the required area to mitigate the mass of carbon dioxide emitted from commercial fuels. Higher efficiency can be reached with higher crop yields, such as collecting remaining biomass after harvest rather than leaving it in the field. Another option is to reduce moisture content on solid fuels, such as wood and straw. On average, each Mg ha−1 increased in yield would result in an additional output of 4.5 GJ ha−1. Besides, for each percentage of moisture content reduced in solid fuels, there would be an increase of exergy output of 1 GJ ha−1. © 2020

AB  - Production of biodiesel from lipids of Serratia sp. ISTD04 by lipase of Pseudomonas sp. ISTPL3 immobilised on biocomposite materials to increase the enzyme stability and reusability was studied. Lipase extracted, partially purifiedand immobilized onto activated biochar, impregnated with calcite obtained from biomineralization-based conversion of CO2 from ISTD04, and bioactive ceramics materials, Na2Ca2Si3O9 prepared by chemical process. The composition, structure and texture of biocomposite materials determined by SEM and EDS methods. The composition of synthesized biodiesel was determined by GC–MS. The results imply that the immobilized lipase on activated biochar impregnated with calcite gave the maximum yield of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME:97.41%) followed by immobilized lipase on biochar (FAME:94.91), immobilized lipase on glass-ceramic (FAME:91.50%) and NaOH (FAME:85.63%). The reusability of lipase immobilized on activated biochar impregnated with calcite retained 75.11%and 50% catalytic activity after 5 and 10 cycles of transesterification reaction, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Conventional synthesis of monolith-supported zeolite catalysts is based on a hydrothermal strategy. Here, we report a solvent-free crystallization process to coat ZSM-5 zeolite crystals on a monolithic SiC foam with a honeycomb structure (ZSM-5/SiC). Characterizations of the ZSM-5/SiC by scanning electron microscopy, N2 sorption, and X-ray diffraction indicate that the zeolite sheath has been ideally coated on the surface of the SiC foam with high purity and crystallinity. Fixing Pd nanoparticles within the ZSM-5 zeolite crystals delivers a bifunctional Pd@ZSM-5/SiC catalyst, which exhibits high activity and selectivity toward diesel range paraffins in the hydrodeoxygenation of methyl oleate, a model molecule for biofuel. In comparison to the powder Pd@ZSM-5, the Pd@ZSM-5/SiC monolith catalyst shows more efficiency, which is attributed to the fast mass transfer and high heat conductivity on the honeycomb SiC structure. The durability test indicates that the Pd@ZSM-5/SiC catalyst is stable under the reaction and high-temperature regeneration conditions. © 2020 Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, the Chinese Academy of Sciences

AB  - Liquid fuels are likely to remain the main energy source in long-range transportation and aviation for several decades. To reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, liquid biofuels can be blended to fossil fuels – or used purely. In this paper, coconut methyl ester, standard diesel fuel (EN590:2017), and their blends were investigated in 25 V/V% steps. A novel turbulent combustion chamber was developed to facilitate combustion in a large volume that leads to ultra-low emissions. The combustion power of the swirl burner was 13.3 kW, and the air-to-fuel equivalence ratio was 1.25. Two parameters, combustion air preheating temperature and atomizing air pressure were adjusted in the range of 150–350 °C and 0.3–0.9 bar, respectively. Both straight and lifted flames were observed. The closed, atmospheric combustion chamber resulted in CO emission below 10 ppm in the majority of the cases. NO emission varied between 60 and 183 ppm at straight flame cases and decreased below 20 ppm when the flame was lifted since the combustion occurred in a large volume. This operation mode fulfills the 2015/2193/EU directive for gas combustion by 25%, which is twice as strict as liquid fuel combustion regulations. The 90% NO emission reduction was also concluded when compared to a lean premixed prevaporized burner under similar conditions. This favorable operation mode was named as Mixture Temperature-Controlled (MTC) Combustion. The chemiluminescent emission of lifted flames was also low, however, the OH* emission of straight flames was clearly observable and followed the trends of NO emission. The MTC mode may lead to significantly decreased pollutant emission of steady-operating devices like boilers, furnaces, and both aviation and industrial gas turbines, meaning an outstanding contribution to more environmentally friendly technologies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is the most abundant renewable resource existing, and presently it is considered as a promising feedstock for the synthesis of green chemicals and biofuels for reducing transportation emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. In this research, a TCR (thermo-catalytic reforming) reactor is used to transform lignocellulosic biomass into high quality bio-oils, biochar and syngas. Sugarcane bagasse (SB) and oat hulls (OHS) were processed in the TCR (2 kg/h) at 450 °C in the intermediate pyrolysis reactor (kept constant) and varying reforming temperature between 500 and 700 °C. This paper studies the conversion potential of SB and OHS into sustainable bioproducts at different reforming temperatures. TCR oils contained the highest calorific value of 34.9 MJ/kg from SB and 35.0 MJ/kg from OHS at 700 °C which makes the bio-oil suitable to be applied as fuel for engines when compared to bio-oils produced from other pyrolysis technologies. SB and OHS pyrolysis gas at 700 °C contained higher H2 yield 30.9 vol% and 31.6 vol%, respectively. The highest gas caloric values of SB and OHS were 18.4 MJ/kg and 18.8 MJ/kg at the same reforming temperatures, respectively. Overall, the TCR results of SB and OHS are promising for waste conversion into sustainable fuels. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Rhodococcus sp. HX-2 could degrade diesel oil in the presence of 1%–10 % NaCl. The compatible solute betaine accumulated in cells with increasing NaCl concentration, and this was found to be the main mechanism of resistance of HX-2 to high salt concentration. Exogenously added betaine can be transported into cells, which improved cell growth and the percentage degradation of diesel oil in the presence of high [NaCl] in solution and in soil. Scanning electron microscopy data suggested that addition of exogenous betaine facilitated salt tolerance by stimulating exopolysaccharide production. Fourier-transform infrared analysis suggested that surface hydroxyl, amide and phosphate groups may be related to tolerance of high-salt environments. Four betaine transporter-encoding genes (H0, H1, H3, H5) and the betaine producer gene betB were induced in Rhodococcus sp. HX-2 by NaCl stress. The maximal induction of H0, H1, H3 and H5 transcription depended on high salinity plus the presence of betaine. These results demonstrate that salt tolerance is mediated by accumulated betaine in Rhodococcus sp. HX-2 cells, and the potential of this strain for application in bioremediation of hydrocarbon pollution in saline environments. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Catalytic conversion of 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfuraldehyde (HMF, a biomass-derived platform chemical) into ethyl levulinate (EL) is an attractive approach for producing renewable transport fuels for mitigating global warming. We report here the application of hierarchical zeolites (DZSM-5 and MZSM-5 synthesized by desilication and mesoporous templating approaches, respectively) as solid acid catalysts for this transformation. Hierarchical structure of these zeolites was confirmed by X-ray diffraction, nitrogen-physisorption and electron microscopy, and acidity was determined by temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia. HMF conversion of 94.2% with EL selectivity of 90.8% was achieved over the MZSM-5 catalyst. Acidity, pore size and surface properties affected the catalytic activity. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel derived from biomass is a renewable source of fuel, and global application of biodiesel in the transport sector has rapidly expanded over the last decade. However, effort has been made to overcome its main shortcoming, i.e., efficiency and exhaust emission characteristics (NOx emissions) in unmodified diesel engines. Biodiesel combustion generally results in lower unburned hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate matter (PM) in exhaust emissions compared to fossil diesel. In this study, various biodiesel blends (Chlorella vulgaris, Jatropha curcus, and Calophyllum inophyllum) were investigated for fuel characteristics, and engine performance with exhaust emission compared to diesel. Chlorella vulgaris, Jatropha curcus, and Calophyllum inophyllum biodiesel were synthesized by the acid–base transesterification approach in a microwave reactor and blended with conventional diesel fuel by volume. The fuel blends were denoted as MB10 (90% diesel + 10% microalgae biodiesel), MB20 (80% diesel + 20% microalgae biodiesel), JB10 (90% diesel + 10% jatropha biodiesel), JB20 (80% diesel + 20% jatropha biodiesel), PB10 (90% diesel + 10% polanga biodiesel) and PB20 (80% diesel + 20% polanga biodiesel). Experiments were performed using these fuel blends with a single-cylinder four-stroke diesel engine at different loads. It was shown in the results that, at rated load, thermal efficiency of the engine decreased from 34.6% with diesel to 34.1%, 33.7%, 34.1%, 34.0%, 33.9%, and 33.5% with MB10, MB20, JB10, JB20, PB10, and PB20 fuels, respectively. Unburned hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide and smoke emissions improved with third-generation fuels (MB10, MB20) in comparison to base diesel fuel and second-generation fuels (JB10, JB20, PB10 and PB20). Oxides of nitrogen emissions were slightly increased with both the third-and second-generation fuels as compared to the base diesel. The combustion behavior of microalgae biodiesel was also very close to diesel fuels. In the context of comparable engine performance, emissions, and combustion characteristics, along with biofuel production yield (per year per acre), microalgae biodiesel could have a great potential as a next-generation sustainable fuel in compression engine (CI) engines compared to jatropha and polanga biodiesel fuels. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Bio-oil has several undesired fuel properties such as high viscosity, high acidity, high molecular weight, instability, and phase separation upon aging. Further, the high oxygen content (typically 45–50 wt%) and the water content (typically 15–30 wt%) of pyrolysis oil result in a lower energy density than conventional fuel oils. Whole bio-oil from the fast pyrolysis of birch bark is phase separated at room temperature, probably because of the high extractive content of the bark. It prevents the application of bio-oil derived from birch bark as a fuel. Therefore, the main objective of this research is to investigate the application of fractional condensation of pyrolysis vapors as a promising method to obtain bio-oils that are more resistant to aging. Bio-oil vapors were separated into three cuts: a hard solid in the first condenser, a viscous oily cut (“second condenser cut”) in the second condenser/electrostatic precipitator, and a water-rich acidic liquid in the third condenser. It was found that fractional condensation is an effective method to separate water, acids and other low molecular weight reactive components from bio-oil and is a promising downstream approach to control the quality of bio-oils, making it more suitable for further upgrading and/or direct application. Performing fractional condensation and mixing the second condenser oil fraction with 25% isopropanol yields a very stable liquid fuel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel was prepared at laboratory scale via transesterification reaction from waste cooking oil using Sr-Ti mixed metal oxide as a heterogeneous base catalyst. The solid base catalyst was synthesized by polymer precursor method. The most efficient active phase of catalyst was explored by varying the Sr/Ti atomic ratio in mixed metals oxides. The synthesized catalyst underwent for TGA, Powder XRD, SEM, EDX, FT-IR, XPS, and BET surface area analysis to assess its physicochemical characteristics. Additionally, basicity which has been observed as the most process governing factor was also evaluated through Hammett indicator-benzoic acid titration method. The Sr-Ti mixed metals oxide with 4:1 was observed with highest catalytic activity for methanolysis reaction. Its potency was facilitated by fairly acquired BET surface area (43.6 m2/g) and basic strength (2.89 mmol/g). The appreciable values of both the parameters imparted the high catalytic activity in Sr-Ti mixed metals oxide with atomic ratio 4:1. Onward, transesterification reaction was optimized for the maximum FAME conversion through RSM using CCD. The confirmatory tests showed the consistency with the conclusions drawn from RSM study regarding optimized values of concerned process variables. Transesterification reaction turned out 98% FAME conversion exerting catalyst dose (1.0 wt%), methanol to oil molar ratio (11:1), and reaction time (80 min) at reaction temperature (65 °C) and agitation speed (600 rpm) featured by RSM study. The closeness in optimized value of anticipated and confirmatory results perceived the efficiency of CCD and approving its potency as successful tool to estimate the highest FAME conversion. Next, a pseudo-first-order kinetic model of transesterification reaction was established. In addition to this, the thermodynamic functions were also computed through Eyring plot dictating the non-spontaneity and endergonic nature of transesterification reaction. The Environment-factor (E-factor) and Turn Over Frequency (TOF) were enumerated and they approved the prepared Sr-Ti mixed metals oxide as an efficient and sustainable catalyst for biodiesel production through transesterification. Finally, all the important fuel properties of prepared biodiesel from waste cooking oil was discerned within the range laid by ASTM D-6751 standards for biodiesel which coined the compatibility of prepared methyl ester with CI engines as a substitute of diesel fuel. © 2020

AB  - Orange peel waste (OPW), the primary byproduct of the juice extraction process, is annually generated in massive amounts (21 Mton), and its aqueous extraction in biorefining operations yields a liquid fraction, referred to as orange peel extract (OPE). Although OPE contains significant amounts of easily assimilable carbohydrates, such as fructose, glucose, and sucrose, no investigations have been conducted yet to assess its possible use in biodiesel production by oleaginous yeasts. Consequently, the objective of the present study was to assess whether OPE might act as the basis of a liquid medium for microbial lipid production. A screening conducted with 18 strains of oleaginous yeasts in shaken flask on the OPE-based medium showed that Rhodosporidium toruloides NRRL 1091 and Cryptococcus laurentii UCD 68-201 gave the best results in terms of lipid production (5.8 and 4.5 g L−1, respectively) and accumulation (77 and 47% on a dry matter basis, respectively). The subsequent scale transfer of the process to a 3-L STR operated in batch mode halved the time required to reach the lipid peak with the ensuing increase in volumetric productivities in R. toruloides NRRL 1091 (3646 mg L−1 day−1) and C. laurentii UCD 68-201 (2970.7 mg L−1 day−1). The biodiesel yields from the lipids of the former and the latter strain were 36.9 and 31.9%, respectively. Based on multivariate analysis of fatty acid methyl ester compositions, the lipids from the former and the latter strain were highly resembling those of Jatropha and palm oils, two commonly used feedstocks for biodiesel manufacturing. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The objective of the present study is the assessment of the environmental impact of a bivalent (bi-fuel) vehicle, running either on gasoline or compressed natural gas (CNG). To that aim, a Euro 6 passenger car was tested under various real-world driving conditions. In order to cover the full range of conventional powertrains currently in the market, the tests were also repeated on a Euro 6 diesel passenger car. Both cars were driven in two routes, the first complying with the regulation limits and the second going beyond them. Carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particle number (PN) emissions were recorded using a Portable Emissions Measurement System (PEMS). Apart from the aggregated emission levels, in g/km, the exact emission location along the route was also assessed. Natural gas proved beneficial for CO and PN emissions, the level of which always remained below the respective legislation limits. On the other hand, under the dynamic driving conditions with gasoline, the relevant limits were exceeded. Cold start, occurring at the beginning of the urban part, and motorway driving were identified as major contributors to total emissions, especially in gasoline mode. However, the application of natural gas was associated with a penalty in NOx emissions, which were significantly increased as compared to gasoline. Local peaks within the urban part were identified in CNG mode. In any case, the diesel vehicle was by far the highest NOx emitter. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.) is a winter annual oilseed crop with relatively high seed oil content (25-36%-wet basis), which can be planted as cover crop in corn-soybean rotation in the Midwestern U.S., to provide both economic benefits and ecosystem services. Pennycress oil has adequate quality for conversion to renewable jet fuel (RJF); however, the technical feasibility and cost of pennycress supply at the commercial scale have not been evaluated; so, the objective of this study was to evaluate techno-economics of the production, harvest and post-harvest logistics of pennycress as an RJF feedstock. In addition, an uncertainty analysis was performed to address the inherent variability of the parameters used for this evaluation. This study considered the feedstock supply for a biorefinery with RJF production capacity of around 19 million liters per year (i.e., 5 million gallons per year) in Ohio. Technical feasibility included the assessment of resources (land, infrastructure, machineries, fuel, labor, and consumables) for the production (i.e., planting, fertilizer and pesticide applications), harvest and post-harvest logistics (i.e., grain handling, transportation, drying and storage). Economic analyses included estimation of pennycress production and logistics costs. Annual pennycress seed requirement for the selected biorefinery capacity was estimated to be 90–115 thousand t (90% central range - CR), which would require pennycress plantation in 41–63 thousand ha (90% CR) land in corn-soybean rotation. The direct fossil fuel use ratio (i.e., fossil fuel use per liter of RJF produced) for pennycress production and logistics was estimated to be 0.06–0.09 L/L (90% CR). Estimated total cost for the production and logistics was 170–230 $/t (90% CR); and it was identified to be highly sensitive to pennycress seed yield. The outcomes of this research contribute to identifying the bottlenecks and hotspots for establishment of pennycress at the commercial scale in corn-soybean rotation in Ohio and Midwestern U.S. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate algal growth, lipid production, and nutrient removal in chicken farm flushing wastewater (CFFW). The excessive ammonia nitrogen (EAN) content in the CFFW wastewater represented a major factor limiting the algal growth. A strategy of mixing CFFW with municipal wastewater (MW) that contained less ammonia nitrogen was adopted. The results showed that the mixed wastewaters reduced ammonia nitrogen content, balanced nutrient profile, and promoted biomass production. The residual nutrients in mixed wastewaters were significantly reduced due to the algal absorption. Furthermore, alga grown on mixed wastewaters accumulated a higher level of total lipids and monounsaturated fatty acids that can be used for biodiesel production. The key issue of low biomass yield of algal grown on CFFW due to the inhibition of EAN was efficiently resolved by mitigating limiting factor to algal growth basing on mixing strategy, and accordingly the nutrients in the wastewater were significantly removed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - One of the current methods of converting pyrolysis oil and its aqueous phase into more useful biofuels with higher heating value is by the steam reforming technique. In this study, a thermodynamic model for the steam reforming of the aqueous phase of biomass bio-oil was developed. The optimal values of the process parameters for the steam reforming of the aqueous phase of biomass bio-oil are reforming temperature of 773 °C, reforming pressure of 1 atm and steam-to-oil ratio of 20 kg/kg. The synthesis gas obtained at optimal conditions has a hydrogen gas content of 76%, carbon dioxide content of 22%, carbon monoxide content of 2% and only trace quantities of methane. For a theoretical feed of 100 kg/h bio-oil, a water flow rate of 2000 kg/h will be required. Simulation showed that overall gas yield under such feed rate at optimal conditions will generate 131.3 kg/h synthesis gas (with 76% H2 content) and 1968.7 kg/h of condensate water. The interaction of the factors with regard to all chemical species was also extensively investigated. © 2019, Institute of Chemistry, Slovak Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The transportation sector faces a big energy challenge as it looks for more advanced technologies and renewable sources, in which pre-chamber ignition systems and bioethanol have gained worldwide recognition. In this manuscript, a homogenous torch ignition (HTI) system was experimentally analyzed in a commercial four-cylinder engine equipped with port-fuel injection and fueled with a gasoline-bioethanol blend with 25% of bioethanol by volume (E25). Tests were performed at a wide range of speeds and loads for stoichiometric and lean mixtures. Through in-cylinder pressure measurement, a combustion analysis was carefully carried out. Results show that the HTI system leads to a much faster combustion rate and low engine cycle-to-cycle variation due to enhanced ignition energy and turbulence levels in the main chamber, and is able to extend the lean combustion limit with acceptable combustion covariance up to λ = 1.30. Moreover, improved combustion phasing combined with reduced pumping losses and lower heat transfer to the cooling system decreased fuel consumption. BSFC was improved up to 8.4%, 12.1% and 10.2% for engine speeds of 2500, 3500 and 4500 rpm, respectively, for the 3.5 and 4.6 BMEP conditions at λ = 1.20, while the higher load (5.8 bar BMEP) was improved up to 8.6% at λ = 1.30. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Binary mixtures of ionic liquids (ILs) have been used for developing one-pot systems suitable for the direct extraction and biocatalytic transformation of algal oil to biodiesel without prior isolation. These mixtures were based on the combination of sponge-like ionic liquids (e.g. 1-hexadecyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(triﬂuoromethylsulfonyl)imide, [C16mim][NTf2]) with the IL 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([Bmim][Cl]), taking into account the excellent suitability to carry out the biocatalytic synthesis of biodiesel of the first one, and the ability for dissolving cellulosic biomass of the second. The extraction of oils was carried out by incubating the dry microalgae (Chlorella vulgaris or Chlorella protothecoides) in the appropriated IL binary mixture at 110 °C, which after being cooled at 60 °C allowed to be transformed to biodiesel by an immobilized lipase. This resulted in a fast and efficient biodiesel synthesis, e.g. up to 100% yield in 2 h at 60 °C. The subsequent cooling until room temperature and the iterative centrifugation of the resulting semi-solid systems at 20 and 18 °C led to the separation of the liquid algae biodiesel from the solid IL mixture, which was recovered and reused for further operation cycles. © 2019

AB  - Substitution of fossil energy sources for bio-based ones will require development of efficient processes that can convert inedible and preferably low-value fractions that currently are not used into high-value products. It is desirable that such processes are developed so that both current logistics and infrastructure can be used. Bark, which is the outer layer of woody biomass, is currently burnt in a low-value process or left in the forests to decay and is therefore considered waste. In this work, birch (Betula pendula) bark was converted to hydrocarbons suitable for use in both road and aviation fuels in two efficient steps. Development of an efficient, recyclable, salt- A nd metal-free solvent-based system to solubilize birch bark under benign reaction conditions was a key outcome. The obtained gum was composed of organosolv lignin and suberin oligomers and was fully characterized. This gum had unique properties and could be directly processed in a conventional hydroprocessing unit set-up to afford hydrocarbons in the road and aviation fuel ranges. Life cycle assessment was applied to evaluate different scenarios for implementing this technology. When using bark generated as a forestry by-product and current infrastructure in a pulp mill, the process had a favorable low carbon dioxide footprint for biofuel generation.

AB  - Camelina sativa is a promising oilseed crop used for dietary oil and as a biofuel feedstock. C. sativa is a highly adaptable, cool season crop that can be grown on marginal lands with minimal inputs, making it potentially suitable for growth in Northern Nevada and other cooler and drier semi-arid regions of North America. A five-year (2011 to 2015) field trial was conducted to evaluate the seed yield, oil content, and oil and biodiesel production potential of eight C. sativa cultivars in semi-arid regions of Northern Nevada. Columbia, Cheyenne, Calena, and Blaine Creek were ranked as the top four varieties based on the five-year study of mean seed yield, oil content, and estimated oil and biodiesel production values, although none of the cultivars were significant (p &gt; 0.05). Overall, Columbia displayed the highest seed yield, harvest index, oil yield and potential biodiesel production of 910 kg ha−1, 0.147, 273.4 kg ha−1, and 86.4 L ha−1, respectively, across five growing seasons. For each individual year across the eight cultivars, seed yield, oil content, oil and potential biodiesel production was highest in 2015, and lowest in 2012 and 2013 (the drier years). The seed yields of this study fall within the ranges of yields reported in both the irrigated and rainfed locations of the Western United States. Based on the seed yield, oil, and the estimated oil and biodiesel productivity reported in this study, C. sativa can be grown successfully with supplemental irrigation in semi-arid environments like Nevada. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - In this study, bioethanol produced from sugar beet and biodiesel produced from waste cooking oils was blended with each other in the volumetric rates to be 20% and 80%, respectively. Cetane improver (di-tert-butyl peroxide) was added into blend fuel in 1–2–3% as volumetric. The obtained blends were used as a fuel in the diesel engine which is single-cylinder, direct-inject, four-stroke. The tests were conducted under four different engine loads (25%, 50%, 75% and 100%) and 1400 rpm engine speed. The test results showed that brake-specific fuel consumption was decreased up to 15.5% thanks to the addition of cetane improver, although biodiesel and bioethanol increased brake-specific fuel consumption by 16.1% and 27.54%, respectively. However, brake thermal efficiency values were increased up to 9.44% with both biodiesel and cetane improver added blend fuels, while brake thermal efficiency was decreased by 3.88% with bioethanol addition. The more compatible combustion characteristics with that of diesel fuel have been obtained due to especially the increase in cetane number. The use of biofuels increased both maximum cylinder pressure and heat release rate. While, with the cetane improver addition, a decrease in CO, HC and smoke opacity values was observed up to 22.5%, 17.44% and 24.44%, respectively, CO2, NOX and exhaust gas temperature values were increased up to 19.55%, 5% and 15.22%, respectively, according to bioethanol blend fuel. © 2020, The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering.

AB  - In this study, the effects of bioethanol mixing with gasoline on the emission of particulates and gaseous emissions at ultra-high pressure injection up to 50 MPa were investigated in a gasoline direct-injection (GDI) engine. A 398 cc single-cylinder engine fueled with bioethanol blends was used for the experiment. The gaseous emission was measured by an emission bench, and particle number (PN) was counted by a PPS-M device. Experiments were carried out under the conditions of maximum injection pressure of 50 MPa and constant intake flow rate with various injection conditions. Gasoline and bioethanol-blended fuel was used, with the blending ratio varied from 10% to 50% by volume. The results indicated that, as the injection pressure and bioethanol content increased, the PN decreased by 93.6% and 78.9%, respectively. PN emission is proportional to bioethanol contents in case of PN emitted from wall film. Effect of bioethanol addition with ultra-high pressure injection over 35 MPa is not significant on PN, since atomization enhancement due to the increased injection pressure is saturated. Total hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide emissions decreased up to 34.5% and 35.6% with increasing oxygenated fuel, bioethanol, contents at ultra-high pressure injection over 35 MPa and were remarkably influenced by injection timing. © 2019

AB  - This paper describes the application of chromium(III) terephthalate (Cr-Tp) and cobalt(II) terephthalate (Co-Tp) metal organic frameworks, as heterogeneous acid catalysts to avoid the yield reduction caused by saponification during the process of biodiesel production using Calophyllum inophyllum oil. The catalysts were mainly characterized using spectroscopic (FTIR), microscopic (SEM, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) and X-ray diffractive techniques. The surface acidity and the thermal stability of the catalysts were determined using Hammett indicator and thermo-gravimetric methods, respectively. The catalysts were employed for the pre-esterification of free fatty acid content of the oil before subjecting the oil for the transesterification of its triglyceraldehyde content. The pre-esterification was performed through a couple of successive catalytic cycles under milder conditions [25°, 1 atm, and 2/1 MeOH/oil (w/w) ratio] than the conditions reported so far. The study revealed that the successful pre-esterification required these catalysts in very small amount (&lt; 2.5% by oil weight) and occurred within very short time (2 h for the 1st cycle and 2–4 h for the 2nd cycle), reducing the acid value of C. inophyllum oil significantly (88%) from 56.91 to ~ 6.5 mg KOH g−1. The catalytic activity of these catalysts remained unchanged even after the 10th cycle of catalyst reuse. More importantly, the yield of biodiesel obtained from C. inophyllum oil in this way was significantly high (~ 93%) and free from saponification. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The increasing global demand for biofuels for energy security and to reduce the effects of climate change has created an opportunity to explore new sources of biomass, of which, microalgae is the most promising one. The Laboratory of the Biomass Research Centre (CRB, University of Perugia) is equipped with a photobioreactor that is used to cultivate microalgae under batch conditions. Tests were carried out a temperature of 22 °C and a Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density of 140 μEm-2s-1. Cultures were characterized in terms of biomass produced and lipid fraction distribution. The novelty of this paper is the measure of the fuel properties of Selenastrum capricornutum, a new strain for biodiesel production. In particular, after the microalgae have been collected and oil has been extracted, this has been transesterified using a methanol/NaOH solution. The resulting biodiesel has been analyzed with a high-resolution gas chromatograph to determine the concentration of the different methylesters. © 2020 MDPI AG. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climate change necessitates the development of CO2 neutral or negative routes to chemicals currently produced from fossil carbon. In this paper we demonstrate a pathway from the renewable resource glucose to next generation biofuel isopentanol by pairing the isovaleryl-CoA biosynthesis pathway from Myxococcus xanthus and a butyryl-CoA reductase from Clostridium acetobutylicum. The best plasmid and Escherichia coli strain combination makes 80.50 ± 8.08 (SD) mg/L of isopentanol after 36 h under microaerobic conditions with an oleyl alcohol overlay. In addition, the system also shows a strong preference for isopentanol production over prenol in microaerobic conditions. Finally, the pathway requires zero adenosine triphosphate and can be paired theoretically with nonoxidative glycolysis, the combination being redox balanced from glucose thus avoiding unnecessary carbon loss as CO2. These pathway properties make the isovaleryl-CoA pathway an attractive isopentanol production route for further optimization. Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: Biodiesel and flavor compound production using enzymatic transesterification by microbial lipases provides mild reaction conditions and low energy cost compared to the chemical process. SGNH-type lipases are very effective catalysts for enzymatic transesterification due to their high reaction rate, great stability, relatively small size for convenient genetic manipulations, and ease of immobilization. Hence, it is highly important to identify novel SGNH-type lipases with high catalytic efficiencies and good stabilities. Results: A promiscuous cold-adapted SGNH-type lipase (HaSGNH1) from Halocynthiibacter arcticus was catalytically characterized and functionally explored. HaSGNH1 displayed broad substrate specificity that included tert-butyl acetate, glucose pentaacetate, and p-nitrophenyl esters with excellent stability and high efficiency. Important amino acids (N83, M86, R87, F131, and I173F) around the substrate-binding pocket were shown to be responsible for catalytic activity, substrate specificity, and reaction kinetics. Moreover, immobilized HaSGNH1 was used to produce high yields of butyl and oleic esters. Conclusions: This work provides a molecular understanding of substrate specificities, catalytic regulation, immobilization, and industrial applications of a promiscuous cold-adapted SGNH-type lipase (HaSGNH1) from H. arcticus. This is the first analysis on biodiesel and flavor synthesis using a cold-adapted halophilic SGNH-type lipase from a Halocynthiibacter species. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Crop residue (CR) based-technology has several benefits, including renewable energy production and improvement in the environment and waste biomass management. However, the quantitative assessment of different CR based-technologies in terms of these benefits is limited. In this study, three typical CR-based technologies, CR biochar (CR-BC), CR direct-fired power (CR-DFP), and CR briquette biofuel (CR-BB), were assessed in terms of energy- and environment-related performances using a mixed-unit input-output life cycle assessment method. The results indicated that CR-BB performed better in energy production and air pollution mitigation than the other two technologies. Energy conversion efficiency was suggested as a key factor in determining the potentials of bioenergy production and environmental improvement. Furthermore, based on the energy demand from the Chinese agricultural sector and CR supply in 2012, the energy supply capacity (ESI) of CR-BC, CR-DFP, and CR-BB was estimated to be 24.3, 2.89, and 53.0, respectively, and their total greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction potential (TRGHG) was estimated to be 1.41 × 106, 4.81 × 106, and 1.68 × 106 t CO2e (CO2 equivalent), respectively. Overall, the CR-DFP and CR-BC are recommended for the high-value utilization of CR resources. The findings of this study could provide a basis for the development of CR-based technologies and CR management policy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study developed a new catalyst-free process for producing ethyl levulinate, a biofuel additive. Noncatalytic levulinic acid esterification with ethanol using microwave irradiation (MW) was compared with that using traditional heating (TH) under different reaction conditions. The results demonstrated that the esterification process using MW was more effective than that using TH. A reaction conversion of 90.38% was obtained for the esterification using MW at 473 K and reaction time of 3 hours. Moreover, this study established a model for depicting the kinetics of levulinic acid esterification using MW and TH. A good fit to the data (R2 of &gt;.9999) was achieved, indicating the validity of the developed model. The rate constants and pre-exponential factor obtained for the esterification using MW were greater than those obtained using TH. Consequently, the microwave-assisted noncatalytic synthesis is a green and promising method for preparing ethyl levulinate. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - In this work, the experimental conditions for the transesterification reaction of sunflower oil, over commercial calcium oxide (CaO) as heterogeneous catalysts, have been optimized employing a multi-factorial design based on the response surface methodology (RSM). Hence, the effects of temperature, methanol/oil molar ratio and have been considered. The partial transesterification of sunflower oil produces one mol of monoglyceride (MG) and two moles of fatty acids methyl esters (FAME). This blend constitutes a new type of biofuel called Ecodiesel which can be applicable to diesel engines. This Ecodiesel integrates the glycerol as MG removing by-products and increasing the lubricity of the biofuel. Thus, the reaction conditions, obtained by Response surface methodology (RSM), that promote the highest values of selectivity to Ecodiesel are 65 °C of reaction temperature, 0.7 g of CaO and methanol/oil molar ratio of 5.3. On the other hand, in order to get a biofuel with lower viscosity, 65 °C and 0.7 g of CaO were also employed, although a lower methanol/oil molar ratio of 2 was employed. Operating under these selected experimental conditions, a high conversion value (70 %), a selectivity value to Ecodiesel of 35 % and a viscosity value around 15 cSt can be achieved. The biofuel thus obtained can be used in blends with diesel because in order to accomplish the viscosity limits stablished in the EN 14214. Consequently, this methodology could represent an advance in the technical and economic feasibility in the process of replacing fossil fuels by renewable fuels. © 2020

AB  - Air pollution is a major issue affecting the health of millions of citizens, notably in cities where pollutants are concentrated. Low-temperature combustion is a promising route to reduce nitrogen oxides and smoke emissions from compression ignition engines. Reduction in emissions during low-temperature combustion is known, yet emissions using oxygenated biofuels are poorly known. Therefore, I tested the potential reduction in emissions using oxygenated biofuels during low-temperature combustion, in the reactivity-controlled compression ignition mode. Ethanol, a low-reactivity fuel, was inducted in the intake manifold at 10% and 20% levels on energy basis, whereas waste cooking oil biodiesel, a high-reactivity fuel, was injected directly inside the cylinder. Results show a reduction in emission of nitrogen oxides up to 60%, and of smoke up to 29%. Nonetheless, unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide emissions increased up to 2% at full load for biodiesel with 20% ethanol induction, compared to neat diesel and biodiesel. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The United States biofuel mandate might be the largest operating program to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This paper uses regulatory information about abatement and compliance cost estimates to measure the greenhouse gas abatement cost curve of the mandate. Historical compliance costs per unit of biofuel appear readily available, yet findings here show that using these data along with observed biofuel quantities biases biofuel mandate abatement cost estimates upward. Unbiased estimation requires that related biofuel mandate costs and emissions are estimated along with associated market effects, including on fuel use, using an economic model. Moreover, this approach relates greenhouse gas abatement to the implications for crop prices and land use, taking account of interactions within the crop sector. Results show that the United States biofuel mandate causes up to 20 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent abatement for compliance costs that are equivalent to carbon prices ranging up to $20 per ton, with a large part coming from reductions in petroleum product use as the mandate encourages substitution to biofuels. Abatement costs are reduced if ethanol is made at new facilities with fewer emissions or if petroleum output expansion causes greater emissions than the historical average. Findings also indicate that GHG abatement via the mandate is initially costly due to the nature of biofuel demand, there can be a trade-off between corn price increase and GHG reduction, and the increase in total area planted to crops in the U.S. is less important than the reallocation of land among crops. © 2019

AB  - Project decisions are currently decided primarily on initial costs and neglect environmental and social aspects. In this study, a new optimization algorithm has been developed based on the three-legged stool of sustainability, namely technical, environmental, and socioeconomic aspects. The new algorithm, entitled the sustainability-based optimization algorithm, will minimize the average of normalized values of life-cycle costs, environmental impacts, and social objections subject to the constraint that all options will be acceptable. The optimal combinations of input variable values are found by optimization. The algorithm is demonstrated on algal biofuel production and is adapted from the model described in the greenhouse gases, regulated emissions, and energy use in transportation model. The indicators that are practical and widely applicable in algal production were based on previous studies. The results show the minimum objective function occurs at the combination of input variables that minimizes each component of sustainability, namely CO2-reduction, environmental, and economic aspects. The minimum objective considering only the social aspects occurs at the water-recycling reduction scenario. Considering the optimal solution with the focus only on one of the environmental, social, or economic terms could potentially lead to a solution that is not robust. The advantage of this algorithm is that by considering all active and effective indicators together the most sustainably robust result is found. The new algorithm is potentially applicable for various types of projects involved in resilient infrastructure such as bridges, roads, electrical grids, water distribution systems, sewer systems, water and wastewater treatment plants, and renewable energy. © 2019, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - To improve the performance and emission characteristics in the diesel/CNG dual-fuel combustion mode, bio-fuel of n-butanol as the additive in the pilot fuel was investigated by sweeping a wide range of CNG substitution rates. The experiments were conducted at fixed CA50s of 4.5 and 5.5 °CA ATDC for approximately 5 bar IMEP (low load) and 7.5 bar IMEP (medium load). At low load, the pilot fuel with n-butanol can shorten the combustion duration for each CNG substitution rate, and D90B10 (90% diesel/10% n-butanol by volume basis as the pilot fuel) can improve the indicated thermal efficiency (ITE) with the relatively high CNG substitution rates and reduce CO emission. D80B20 (80% diesel/20% n-butanol by volume basis as the pilot fuel) can reduce both the NOx and CO emissions simultaneously compared to pure diesel as the pilot fuel. At medium load, the pilot fuel with n-butanol can improve ITE with the relatively low CNG substitution rates. It can also reduce the CO emission but slightly increase the NOx emissions. It can be found that the THC emissions are more sensitive to the CNG substitution rate. In addition, the pilot fuel with n-butanol can reduce the CO2 emission at most CNG substitution rates. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The current study aims to explore the opportunities of using the high viscous biofuel namely Wheat Germ oil (WGO) in a twin cylinder CI engine. High viscous fuels suffer from improper atomization leading to poor combustion and higher smoke emission. To address this problem, various techniques namely transesterification, fuel ionization and hydrogen induction were studied. WGO was converted to its ester which reduced the viscosity. Fuel ionization increases the vibrational frequency of the molecules, weakens the bonds and converted to ions, which increases the dispersion rate during injection and improves the combustion subsequently. Hydrogen is having faster flame speed and higher calorific value aids in combustion enhancement at its knock limited levels. The twin cylinder tractor engine selected for this experiment runs at a constant speed of 1500 rpm. The engine was run using diesel to achieve the preferred warm-up condition in order to use WGO, which hada cold starting problem. Tests were conducted with wheat germ biodiesel (WGBD), WGO with permanent magnet (PM), electromagnet (EM) and the combination of PM and EM-based fuel ionization system and finally WGO with hydrogen induction rates of 2%, 4.3%, 6.7% and 10.3% at maximum engine load condition. It is observed that all the techniques improved the performance of WGO. Among the techniques tested, hydrogen induction displayed better results in terms of performance and emission characteristics with a slight penalty in NO emission. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - The aim of this study was to discover a method for testing the quality of agricultural feedstocks (Monodora myristica and Moringa oleifera) for biodiesels production. The quality of the biodiesel was tested using UV absorption spectroscopy, regression analysis of the absorption index and error analysis. It was observed that the chromophore in the feedstock influences the quality of the biodiesel. The best sampling method to determine the quality of the biodiesel from Monodora myristica is within wavelength combination 600 nm/500 nm and 700 nm/600 nm while the best sampling method for testing biodiesel from Moringa oleifera is within wavelength combination 800 nm/500 nm and 800 nm/700 nm. Results showed that regression and error analysis of UV absorption spectroscopy is reliable in determining both the structure of the chromophore and the quality of the biodiesel. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Increasing demand of fossil fuel and its depleting stock across the globe have necessitated a search for potential alternative sources of renewable energy. Recently focus has shifted to production of diesel from bio-oils derived from plant biomass as a potential source. However, it has been an endeavour to shift the exploration to non-edible oils produced by non-crop plants. Hiptage benghalensis is one such unexplored plant which stores ricinoleic acid in its seeds. In this report, analyses of various biochemical and biophysical parameters of H. benghalensis seed oil have been undertaken in order to explore the potential of this oil for biodiesel production. The plant was sourced from three different geographic regions of India. The total lipid and ricinoleic acid contents of seeds obtained from three locations varied from 54 to 69% and 69–87 %, respectively. Properties of various parameters of the H. benghalensis seed oil (HbSO), besides being non-edible prove its potential as a biodiesel feedstock. In order to test this potential, the seed oil was converted into biodiesel through the process of transesterification with an efficiency of ∼93 %. Analysis of various fuel properties like acid value, calorific value, viscosity, density, ash content, flash, pour and cloud point of the biodiesel in accordance with ASTM-D6751 standard and a comparison with the properties of other reported biodiesels showed its reasonable quality. Thus, this non-edible oil from H. benghalensis seeds has a potential to be utilized as an alternate green energy source for biodiesel production. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In a reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI) engine, when the ratio of premixed low-reactively fuel is high, unacceptable high pressure rise rate (PRR) always occurs. The objective of this study is to find effective ways of mitigating the high PRR in and biodiesel and gasoline fueled RCCI engine. Coupled KIVA4-CHEMKIN code was used to mimic the combustion process of RCCI engine with 70% of premixed gasoline. At first, parametric studies were conducted to investigate the effects of intake valve close (IVC) timing and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rate, respectively. Results indicate that delaying IVC timing and increasing EGR rate could mitigate the maximum PRR. Then, a two-stage optimization was undertaken by considering IVC timing and EGR rate at one time. To guide the optimization, contour maps on indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) and emissions were generated. It was found that high EGR rate with advanced IVC timing would lead to satisfying results. Finally, two optimal cases were identified. Comparing with the cases of varying IVC timing and EGR rate individually, while resulting same acceptable maximum PRR, the optimal cases emit much lower NO, soot and CO emissions, and achieve slightly higher thermal efficiency. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Stable neat oil emulsions were prepared and tested in a multi-cylinder engine to assess the exhaust emission and performance characteristics. The heating value of the biofuel-diesel blend emulsion was 16.8% higher than neat rapeseed oil and 6.7% lower than neat diesel fuels. The density of the biofuel emulsions were increased by up to 11% as compared to neat fossil diesel. The engine produced similar power output when emulsified fuels were used instead of fossil diesel. At full load, the thermal efficiency of neat biofuel emulsion was 12% higher than that of fossil diesel. At higher loads, the bsfc of the biofuel blend emulsion was very close to that of fossil diesel. Compared to fossil diesel, emulsified fuels gave slightly higher CO2 emissions. Biofuel and biofuel-diesel blend emulsions produced up to 15% lower NOx emissions. At 100% load, the smoke intensity of biofuel blend emulsion was about 29% lower than neat fossil diesel operation. Emulsified fuels combusted well, and at higher loads produced similar exhaust gas temperatures to those in neat fossil diesel operation. The study concluded that neat oil - diesel - water emulsion fuel could be used in an unmodified diesel engine for increased thermal efficiency and decreased emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The highly selective conversion of furanic molecules to biofuels was achieved on the hierarchical catalysts, which were prepared through modifying the commercially microporous zeolites with sequential alkali and acid post-synthesis treatments. The characterization results indicated that the post-synthesis treatment could successfully introduce the mesopores into the microporous ZSM-5 sample as well as adjust its acidity. The yield of three furanic ethers i.e. 2,5-bis(ethoxymethyl)furan, 5-ethoxymethyl-furfural, and ethyl furfuryl ether on the AT(0.50)-OT catalyst were 94.7%, 90.6%, and 58.2%, respectively. The excellent performance could be attributed to the synergic effect of mass transfer efficiency and surface acidity. This work provides a simple route to prepare high-performance catalysts for the production of biofuels from biochemical. © 2019

AB  - This study evaluated the IC50 value of cadmium against four different strains of microalgae. Chlorella sorokiniana was able to tolerate 300 mg/L of cadmium. The lipid productivity increased by 6% at 50 mg/l of Cd (II) stress. The decrease in biomass productivity was recorded with increasing concentration of Cd. The results showed that chlorophyll contents, chlorophyll a (Chl a) and chlorophyll b (Chl b) gradually decreased on increasing the concentration of Cd over 100 mg/l. The FAME composition of C. sorokiniana cultivated under Cd (II) stress and control medium were analyzed to determine the quality of the biodiesel produced. The major fatty acids present in the TAGs of the treated microalga were C10:0, C12:0, and C15:0. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Energy security and environmental problems are important factors behind the increasing biomass consumption around the world including the lower-income countries such as Pakistan. To utilize local biomass reserves more efficiently in the context of future energy demand, the possession of knowledge about recent energy system in different sectors of the country has become interestingly important. A few initiatives and technologies are currently under process in order to move towards renewable resources from non-renewable resources and minimizing dependency on fossil fuels and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In recent past, some ideas have been developed for sustainable biofuel production which will make sure a rapid shift from an unsustainable attitude towards a potentially sustainable approach. Hence, in this review, detailed data about the potential of biomass for the production of renewable energy in Pakistan have been presented, keeping in view the recent energy mix and future perspectives. The feasibility of local/indigenous biomass reserves and important conversion methods to transform such biomass reserves to bioenergy has also been discussed. Here, we also highlighted the drivers for consumption of local/indigenous biomass reserves in future energy system along with the challenges related to energy systems among various stakeholders. Finally, the suggestions/recommendations on the government policies and future directions for successful implementation of the energy production from local/indigenous biomass resources have been given which could be sufficient to meet increasing energy demands of Pakistan. © 2020, Saudi Society for Geosciences.

AB  - The raw Jojoba oil is utilized to produce biodiesel via a transesterification process, which is optimized using smoke point, yield, and viscosity of produced biodiesel, as well as the final product, is characterized utilizing GC-MS and FTIR. Then, the combustion and emission characteristics of Jojoba oil biodiesel-Jet-A1 blends are performed utilizing a lean premixed pre-vaporized combustion (LPP) approach. The JME with two blending ratios of 10% and 20% by volume and jet fuel of 90% and 80% by volume, as well as the pure jet fuel, are burned in an LPP combustor at two different equivalence ratios of 0.87 and 0.95 to investigate the suitability of using the JME-jet A1 fuel blends as an alternative energy resource. The LPP combustor is designed precisely regarding a comprehensive survey of the main parameters affecting on it, and its combustion results show that it has an acceptable and stable flame. The results indicate that the NOx emission decreases with enlarging the volume fraction of JME, while the CO and UHC formation increase. The flame temperature distributions are similar for the different tested fuels. It can be deduced that Jojoba biodiesel can be used up to 20% by volume as an alternative fuel with jet fuel in a commercial application. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, iron sources and their optimum concentrations for high-quality biodiesel production were determined on Auxenochlorella protothecoides microalgae. Three iron compounds—ferrous sulfate, ferric ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and ferric chloride—were assessed regarding concentration, specific growth rate, lipid, and lipid quality in relation to fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) composition of microalgal biomass. Auxenochlorella protothecoides demonstrated high resistivity to high concentrations of iron species, still showing an ability to grow in the presence of iron concentrations as high as 21.60 mM. The highest saturated fatty acid (SFA), at 78.5% of FAME, was observed at 1.15 mM ferric chloride, and the highest biomass generation was observed at 1.08 mM ferrous sulfate. In addition, biodiesel and diesel fuel qualities were satisfactory with microalgae cultivated at 0.2 and 14.4 mM ferrous sulfate, 7.19 mM ferric EDTA, and 0.07–21.58 mM ferric chloride concentrations. The former may be more practical, since the use of this iron compound gives the desired result in a broader range. Overall, it can be inferred that high-quality lipid and biodiesel production can be obtained by changing the concentrations and sources of iron compounds. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper compares the cost and life cycle environmental performance of renewable diesel produced from upgraded catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) and fast pyrolysis (FP) bio-oils produced from forest residues. Integrating zeolite catalyst into the pyrolysis reactor in CFP requires upgrading in one catalytic hydrocracking step, whereas FP requires upgrading by multiple catalytic hydrotreating and hydrocracking steps, raising capital costs. The FP system considers hydrogen production from co-produced biochar, further raising capital costs but eliminating the large external hydrogen need. Despite lower capital costs, due to higher operating costs from catalyst replacement and purchased hydrogen, the estimated minimum selling price of CFP fuel ($2/L) is greater than FP fuel ($1.68/L). Utilities, hydrogen and catalyst contributions to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, exergy and annual cost are sizeable for CFP. However, GHG emissions for CFP (−72 to 32 g CO2e/MJ) are low and negative when considering credits for biochar due to a high biochar to fuel product ratio (2:1). In contrast, FP with catalytic upgrading maintains a high biofuel yield and low GHG emissions (8–13 g CO2e/MJ) that meet energy policy objectives with more favorable economics compared to CFP. Neither fuel is cost competitive with petroleum-diesel even with renewable fuel credits. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Upgrading the inferior properties of Calophyllum inophyllum oil via catalytic cracking into biofuel required a porous heterogeneous acid catalysts. Hierarchical ZSM-5 (Hi-ZSM-5(K)) produced from desilication of kaolin-derived ZSM-5 was employed as catalyst and the activity was compared with hierarchical ZSM-5 obtained from templating method (Hi-ZSM-5(T)). Catalytic cracking of Calophyllum inophyllum oil was carried out in one-pot reaction at 475 °C for 120 min under the flow of H2 and the products analysed using GC-MS were consisted of the mixtures of alkane, alkene, oxygenated carbon and aromatics compound. The advantages of desilication method for the formation of highly selective hierarchical ZSM-5 was observed when the catalyst exhibited enhanced acidity with mesopores diameter of 2–5 nm to give 93% conversion and high selectivity towards light C7–C9 hydrocarbons. However, Hi-ZSM-5(T) showed low acidity to give only 43% conversion, and selectivity towards C11–C12 hydrocarbons due to the mesopores diameter of 3–12 nm. The activity of hierarchical ZSM-5 was also compared with microporous ZSM-5 that produced biofuel with approximately equal distribution of C5–C18 hydrocarbons. The role of hierarchical structures was further discussed on the composition of aromatics compound, oxygenates content and alkene/alkane ratios of the biofuel. © 2020 Energy Institute

AB  - Dimethyl ether (DME) is an advanced second-generation biofuel produced via methanol dehydration over acid catalysts such as γ-Al2O3, at temperatures above 240 °C and pressures above 10 bar. Heteropolyacids such as tungstosilicic acid (HSiW) are Brønsted acid catalysts with higher DME production rates than γ-Al2O3, especially at low temperatures (140–180 °C). In this work, we show that the performance of supported HSiW for the production of DME is strongly affected by the nature of the support. TiO2 and SiO2 supported HSiW display the highest DME production rates of ca. 50 mmolDME/h/gHSiW. Characterization of acid sites via 1H-NMR, NH3-isotherms and NH3-adsrobed DRIFT reveal that HSiW/X have Brønsted acid sites, HSiW/TiO2 showing more and stronger sites, being the most active catalyst. Methanol production increases with T until 200 °C where a rapid decay in methanol conversion is observed. This effect is not irreversible, and methanol conversion increases to ca. 90% by increasing reaction pressure to 10 bar, with DME being the only product detected at all reaction conditions studied in this work. The loss of catalytic activity with the increasing temperature and its increasing with reaction pressure accounts to the degree of contribution of the pseudo-liquid catalysis under the reaction conditions studied. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Ammonia (NH3) is considered a promising carbon-neutral fuel, with a high hydrogen content, that can diversify the global energy system. Blending ammonia with a highly reactive fuel is one possible strategy to enhance its combustion characteristics. Here, an investigation of blends of NH3 and dimethoxymethane (DMM), a biofuel with high fuel-born oxygen content and no carbon-carbon bonds, is reported. Unstretched laminar burning velocity (SL) and Markstein length of different NH3/DMM blends were experimentally determined using spherically propagating premixed flames. The DMM mole fraction was varied from 0.2 to 0.6 while measuring SL at 298 K, 0.1 MPa, and equivalence ratios (φ) over the range of 0.8-1.3. The addition of DMM was found to immensely enhance the combustion characteristics of ammonia. DMM 20% (by mole fraction) in the NH3/DMM blend increased SL by more than a factor of 3 over neat ammonia; such enhancement was found to be comparable to 60% CH4 in NH3 (φ = 0.9-1.1) blends. Increasing φ was found to significantly decrease the burned gas Markstein length for lean cases, whereas a negligible effect was observed for rich mixtures. A composite chemical kinetic model of DMM/NH3, aimed at interpreting the high-temperature combustion chemistry, was able to reliably predict SL for neat NH3 and DMM flames. Also, the predictive capability of the kinetic model to describe SL for DMM/NH3 blends is reasonably good. Sensitivity analysis and reaction path analysis indicated that the NH3/DMM blends could be understood as dual oxidation processes of the individual fuels that are competing for the same radical pool. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Considering the depletion of fossil fuel, alternative energy resources have been continuously investigated. Microalgae-derived biofuel can be a solution to replace traditional fuel; however, biofuel contains much nitrogen-containing compounds (NCCs) such as carbazole (CBZ) and benzonitrile (PhCN). In this work, effective denitrogenation of biofuel was investigated by using MOFs, especially having multi-functional groups and high porosity. MIL-101-NH2 was modified with oxalyl chloride (OC) to have a MOF called M101-OC. The M101-OC showed remarkable performance in adsorptive denitrogenation from biofuel. Or, M101-OC had 3.8- and 19.6-times adsorption capacity for CBZ and PhCN that of activated carbon, respectively; and showed the highest adsorption capacity, compared with any known adsorbent. The noticeable performances of M101-OC could be explained with hydrogen bonding due to ample hydrogen donor and hydrogen acceptor sites on the M101-OC. Finally, the investigated MOF was also easily recycled via simple ethanol washing. Therefore, M101-OC might be a promising adsorbent for the purification of microalgae-derived biofuel having much NCCs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector of New Zealand have increased rapidly over the last two and half decades despite various policy initiatives by the government. This raises questions over the acceptability and effectiveness of various policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from this sector. This study therefore investigates the mitigation potential of various transport policies while considering their costs, benefits and ethical aspects. A multi-criteria analysis technique is adopted to understand how experts (including policy advisers) perceive the costs, benefits, emissions reduction potentials and ethical priorities of New Zealand's transport policies. A total of 26 policy options are identified, and they are categorized under six mitigation policy pathways. The perspectives of experts are sought and aggregated using the Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) technique to compare and evaluate the mitigation policy pathways and policy options. Results demonstrate that increasing active and public transport investment is the most acceptable option followed by travel demand management, a carbon price, electric vehicle support, and support for fuel-efficient vehicles and biofuels. However, in terms of emissions reduction potential, ceasing the import of petrol and diesel cars into New Zealand by 2030 is found to be the strongest policy option. It is expected that the findings of this study will help illuminate the costs, benefits, mitigation potential and ethical aspects of various transport emissions reduction measures and assist policy advisers in identifying the most attractive policies and projects for investment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this research, a thermodynamic zero-dimensional model has been done to predict performance characteristics (in-cylinder pressure, heat released, and the thermal efficiency) of a diesel engine with the use of biodiesel–diesel fuel blends (B0, B20, B50, B80, and B100) at different compression ratios (14, 15, 16, 17, and 18). The corresponding mathematical and thermodynamic relationships have been solved in MATLAB. Based on the experimental tests, it was found that the developed model can predict the engine variables sufficiently. According to the results, the heat release rate and the cylinder pressure increased for all fuel blends by an increase in the compression ratio. Moreover, with the increasing biodiesel amount in the fuel blend (up to 50%) heat release rate and the cylinder pressure increased but these variables have a reduction when biodiesel percentage increases from 50 to 100 due to the lower heating value of waste cooking oil methyl ester in comparison with neat diesel fuel. Moreover, according to the experimental tests, carbon monoxide emission was reduced when biodiesel proportion increased in the fuel blend but the nitrogen oxides emitted from the engine enhanced when biodiesel amount in the fuel mixture increased. According to the results, it can be concluded that B50 has better combustion characteristics among all fuel blends. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Blending biomass feedstock is a promising approach to mitigate supply chain risks that are common challenges for large-scale biomass utilization. Understanding the potential environmental benefits of biofuels produced from blended biomass and identifying driving parameters are critical for the supply chain design. Herein, a cradle-to-gate life cycle analysis model for fast pyrolysis biorefineries converting blended feedstocks (pine residues and switchgrass) with traditional centralized and alternative decentralized preprocessing sites, so-called depots, is explained. Different scenarios are developed to investigate the impacts of parameters such as feedstock blending ratios, biorefinery and depot capacities, preprocessing technologies, and allocation methods. The life-cycle energy consumption and global warming potential (GWP) of biofuel production with depots vary between 0.7–1.1 MJ MJ−1 and 43.2–76.6 g CO2 eq. MJ−1, respectively. The results are driven by biorefinery processes and depot preprocesses. A decentralized design reduces the energy consumption of the biorefinery but increases the overall life-cycle energy and GWP. Such increases can be significantly mitigated by increasing switchgrass content as the energy consumption at the depot is driven largely by the higher moisture content of pine feedstocks. Allocation methods also have a large impact on the results but do not change the major trends and overall conclusions. © 2019 The Authors. Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - This study aimed to investigate co-torrefaction followed by co-combustion of intermediate waste epoxy resins and fir in the form of mini-pellet to evaluate the potential of industrial wastes as biofuels for alternatives of coals. Co-torrefaction and co-combustion of the materials were analyzed through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) coupled with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. The results suggested that most of the torrefaction had a slight influence on the wastes due to their thermal resistance properties. Conversely, fir was markedly affected by torrefaction, and the corresponding volatiles were the chemicals stripped or reacted from its components (hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin). By introducing an index, both antagonistic and synergistic effects were discovered in the two-stage reaction because new compounds formed during the co-torrefaction and co-combustion processes, as a consequence of catalytic and blocking effects. Overall, co-torrefaction could make the quality of the biofuel from intermediate waste epoxy resins more homogeneous and is a promising route to transform waste epoxy resins into alternative fuels for industrial applications. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the Paris Agreement (PA) submitted so far do not put the world on track to meet the targets of the Agreement and by 2020 countries should ratchet up ambition in the new round of NDCs. Brazil’s NDC to the PA received mixed reviews and has been rated as “medium” ambition. We use the Brazil Land Use and Energy System (BLUES) model to explore low-emission scenarios for Brazil for the 2010–2050 period that cost-effectively raise ambition to levels consistent with PA targets. Our results reinforce the fundamental role of the agriculture, forest, and land use (AFOLU) sectors and explore inter-sectoral linkages to power generation and transportation. We identify transportation as a prime candidate for decarbonization, leveraging Brazil’s already low-carbon electricity production and its high bioenergy production. Results indicate the most important mitigation measures are electrification of the light-duty vehicle (LDV) fleet for passenger transportation, biodiesel and biokerosene production via Fischer-Tropsch synthesis from lignocellulosic feedstock, and intensification of agricultural production. The use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) as well as netzero deforestation make significant contributions. We identify opportunities for Brazil, but synergies and trade-offs across sectors should be minded when designing climate policies. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Biodiesel, as an alternative fuel for petroleum-derived fuel, has gained significant attention from society. In this research work, biodiesel is produced via simultaneous esterification and transesterification of chicken fat and skin oil (CFSO) over Ce supported sulfated activated carbon derived from coconut shell (ACcs-S). Details of a study on the effect of Ce concentrations in the range of 5–15 wt% were also investigated. The results showed that 5 wt% Ce was an optimum concentration for the esterification and transesterification of CFSO with approximately 93% free fatty acid (FFA) conversion. High FFA conversion by 5Ce/ACcs-S is attributed to it having a sufficient amount of acid-base and noticeable pore structures. The effect of four variables (i.e., methanol to chicken fat oil, catalyst loading, reaction time, and temperature) on the FFA conversion was studied via the one-variable–at-a-time method. Optimum FFA conversion (93%) was achieved at a temperature of 90 °C, 12:1 MeOH to oil ratio, 3 wt % catalyst loading, and 1 h reaction time. 5Ce/ACcs-S shows high chemical stability by maintaining the FFA conversion at up to 90% within five consecutive reaction cycles. © 2020

AB  - Microalgae has received overwhelming attention worldwide as a sustainable source for energy generation. However, the production of biofuel from microalgae biomass consists of several steps, of which lipid extraction is the most important one. Because of the nature of feedstock, extraction needs special attention. Three different methods were studied to extract algal oil from two different algae variant, Chlorella sp. and Spirulina sp. The highest percentage oil yield was obtained by ultrasonication (9.4% for Chlorella sp., 6.6% for Spirulina sp.) followed by the Soxhlet and solvent extraction processes. Ultrasonication and Soxhlet extraction processes were further optimized to maximize oil extraction as solvent extraction was not effective in extracting lipid. For ultrasonication, an amplitude of 90% recorded the highest percentage yield of oil for Spirulina sp. and a 70% amplitude recorded the highest percentage yield of oil for Chlorella sp. On the other hand, for Soxhlet extraction, a combination of chloroform, hexane, and methanol at a 1:1:1 ratio resulted in the highest yield of algal oil. Afterward, the crude algae oil from the ultrasonication process was transesterified for 5 h using an immobilized lipase (Novozyme 435) at 40 °C to convert triglycerides into fatty acid methyl ester and glycerol. Thus, ultrasonic-assisted lipid extraction was successful in producing biodiesel from both the species. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The global campaign to minimise greenhouse gas emissions and reduce fossil fuel dependency has led to the consideration of crop residue as feedstock for various bioenergy technologies. In this study, the extent to which various crop residues in the ten administrative regions of Ghana can contribute to the specific heat and electricity demands of each region was assessed. The conversion of residues from 22 crops to briquettes, biomethane and bioethanol-based electricity were examined using resource modelling to determine their potential contribution to wood fuels, Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and electricity demand respectively. The results indicate that, the Eastern Region generated the highest amount of crop residues at 2.3 Mt, mainly from cassava stalks while the Greater Accra Region generated the least amount of crop residue from the ten regions at 52.3 kt. The conversion of selected crop residues to briquettes would contribute to 53.6% of the national wood fuel demand, with Eastern and Brong Ahafo Regions recording the highest individual contributions of 27.7 and 20.5% respectively. Biomethane would contribute to 11.7% of LPG demand in all the ten regions. Electricity generated from bioethanol would supplement 91.2% of the national electricity demand. Overall, the prospects are highest for the production of electricity from bioethanol produced from crop residue to support regional energy demands. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Four types of green alkali modified clinoptilolite (K, Na, Ca, and Mg) were prepared using green tea extracts as novel types of eco-friendly heterogeneous basic catalysts in the transesterification of commercial waste cooking oil into biodiesel. The modified products displayed significant enhancement in the total basicity, surface area, ion exchange capacity, and the morphological properties. The modified samples of K/clinoptilolite (K/Clino), Na/clinoptilolite (Na/Clino), Ca/clinoptilolite (Ca/Clino), and Mg/clinoptilolite (Mg/Clino) showed promising catalytic activities achieving biodiesel yields of 93.6%, 95.2%, 96.4%, and 98.7%, respectively. The best yields were recognized using 4 wt, % as catalysts loading, 16:1 as methanol-to waste oil molar ratio, and at 70 °C as temperature. The best transesterification intervals were identified at 120 min, 120 min, 180 min, and 150 min for K/Clino, Na/Clino, Ca/Clino, and Mg/Clino, respectively. The modified products also demonstrated high reusability properties and the resulted biodiesel in their transesterification systems are of technical properties within the accepted limits of EN 14214 and ASTM D-6751 standards. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The study explores the potential of the Croton macrostachyus seed, a non-edible feedstock found in abundance in the southeastern parts of Ethiopia, for the production of biodiesel. Soxhlet extractor was used to extract, 53.34% of the oil from the Croton macrostachyus seed. This oil was further purified and the resulting product was known as the purified Croton macrostachyus seed (P-CMS) oil. After obtaining the P-CMS oil, biodiesel was produced by the transesterification process. Focus was made on the optimization of biodiesel production by varying the identified process parameters, through the Box- Behnken Design using response surface methodology (RSM) (Design-Expert ® Version 11 software). The crude biodiesel was purified, characterized and complied with the ASTM D6751, United States and the EN 14214, European Union standards. The optimum conversion efficiency of the P-CMS oil to fatty acid methyl ether (FAME) was 96% at the optimal conditions (6:1, methanol to oil ratio; 1%, catalyst loading; 50 °C, reaction temperature). A plan for the environmental impact assessment and life cycle assessment were provided to evaluate the sustainability of this new feedstock and the biodiesel produced from it. Results of these studies indicated the prospective of Croton macrostachyus seed as a new biodiesel feedstock. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrogen fuel offers a cleaner fuel alternative to fossil fuel due to more efficient burning as well as reduces the environmental and health issues brought by fossil fuel usage. In engine application, regardless of either pure hydrogen or in combination with air or/and other biofuel, all the moving parts are exposed to friction and wear, and lubricant is used to minimize friction and wear for optimum operation. Thus, in this study, the use of microalgae oil as an alternative biolubricant is evaluated from the physicochemical and tribological aspects. It is found that modified microalgae oil (MMO) has demonstrated great anti-friction and anti-wear potential, particularly the 10% modified microalgae oil blend (MMO-10). The coefficient of friction is reduced (up to 10.1%) and significant reductions of wear loss and surface roughness are obtained in comparison to pure poly-alpha-olefin. Lubricant's heat dissipation is also enhanced with MMO addition, demonstrating great prospect for MMO for hydrogen-powered engine utilization. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - The goal of the study was to establish the optimal condition for the transesterification process for Hevea brasiliensis oil (HBO) conversion into H. brasiliensis oil methyl esters (HBOME) using a novel base heterogeneous catalyst synthesized from a biowaste (kola nut pod husk). Thus, the influence of concentration of catalyst, MeOH:HBO molar ratio, reaction time and reaction temperature on the HBOME yield was identified using Taguchi orthogonal array design approach. Also, the overall reaction rate constant (k) and reaction order (n) for the process was determined as a way to develop a kinetic model. The results showed that HBOME yield of 96.97 wt% could be achieved using catalyst amount of 3.5 wt%, MeOH:HBO molar ratio of 6:1, reaction time of 75 min and reaction temperature of 65 °C. Performance evaluation of the process input variables suggests reaction time had the highest influence on the HBOME yield. The values of n and k were determined to be 1 and 0.0034 min−1, respectively via kinetic modeling of the transesterification process. The cetane number, kinematic viscosity and acid value of the HBOME produced were 59.54 ± 0.15, 4.98 ± 0.12 mm2/s and 0.22 ± 0.00 mg KOH/g oil, respectively, which compared well with the standard specifications for biodiesel. Thus, HBO and kola nut pod husk could serve as cheap bioresources for biodiesel production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The carbon intensity (CI) of biofuel's well-to-pump life cycle is calculated by life cycle analysis (LCA) to account for the energy/material inputs of the feedstock production and fuel conversion stages and the associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during these stages. The LCA is used by the California Air Resources Board's Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) program to calculate CI and monetary credits are issued based on the difference between a given fuel's CI and a reference fuel's CI. Through the Tier 2 certification program under which individual fuel production facilities can submit their own CIs with their facility input data, the LCFS has driven innovative technologies to biofuel conversion facilities, resulting in substantial reductions in GHG emissions as compared to the baseline gasoline or diesel. A similar approach can be taken to allow feedstock petition in the LCFS so that lower-CI feedstock can be rewarded. Here we examined the potential for various agronomic practices to improve the GHG profiles of corn ethanol by performing feedstock-level CI analysis for the Midwestern United States. Our system boundary covers GHG emissions from the cradle-to-farm-gate activities (i.e. farm input manufacturing and feedstock production), along with the potential impacts of soil organic carbon change during feedstock production. We conducted scenario-based CI analysis of ethanol, coupled with regionalized inventory data, for various farming practices to manage corn fields, and identified key parameters affecting cradle-to-farm-gate GHG emissions. The results demonstrate large spatial variations in CI of ethanol due to farm input use and land management practices. In particular, adopting conservation tillage, reducing nitrogen fertilizer use, and implementing cover crops has the potential to reduce GHG emissions per unit corn produced when compared to a baseline scenario of corn-soybean rotation. This work shows a large potential emission offset opportunity by allowing feedstock producers a path to Tier 2 petitions that reward low-CI feedstocks and further reduce biofuels' CI. The prevalence of significant acreage that has not been optimized for CI suggests that policy changes that incentivize optimization of this parameter could provide significant additionality over current trends in farm efficiency and adoption of conservation practice. © UChicago Argonne, LLC.

AB  - In the current scenario of climate change, the search for alternative energy sources is very important to reduce the use of fossil fuels. Undesired biomass (weed) from agricultural fields can be used to produce biofuels through nano catalysts enhanced gasification and process. Lignocellulosic part of weedy plants represents a potential alternative feedstock for economic production of bioethanol. Large numbers of weedy plant species are growing all over the world. However, high energy requirements and poor-quality biofuel products are the major constraints for utilization of this technology. Nanomaterials could be used as a catalyst to enhance the energy use efficiency and product quality. So, present study was conducted to produce bio-gas, bio-diesel and bio-char from mixed weed biomass of weeds like Carthamous oxyacantha, Asphodelus tenuifolius and Chenopodium album through gasification process using nano-materials as catalysts. Nickel and cobalt nano-particles were used as nano-catalysts to expedite the bio-chemical reactions for the generation of these products at lower temperatures i.e. (400 C°) in a muffle furnace. Further, these products were characterized using GC-MS analysis. It was observed that biodiesel contained 65.47% esters, which indicates its better quality than the normally produced biodiesel having 15–20% esters contents. Similarly, GC-MS analysis of biogas produced from mixed weed biomass showed 3.76% Methane, 8.32% Propane, 50.16% Ethene, 3.12% Propyne and 34.64% Methanol. The present results clearly exhibited the improved product quality and better energy use efficiency in gasification of weed biomass for bioenergy production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The developing approaches in the recovery of resources from biowastes for the production of renewable value-added products and fuels, using microbial cultures as bio-catalyst have now became promising aspect. In the path of anaerobic digestion, the microorganisms are assisting transformation of a complex organic feedstock/waste to biomass and biogas. This potentiality consequently leads to the production of intermediate precursors of renewable value-added products. Particularly, a set of anaerobic pathways in the fermentation process, yields small-chain fatty acids (SCFA), and medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) via chain elongation pathways from waste valorization and CO2 fixation. This review focuses on the production of SCFA and MCFA from CO2, synthetic substrates and waste materials. Moreover, the review introduces the metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae for SCFAs/MCFAs production. Furtherly, it concludes that future critical research might target progress of this promising approach as a valorization of complex organic wastes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We report on commuters’ exposure to black carbon (BC), PM2.5 and particle number (PN, with aerodynamic diameter, da, in the range 0.01 &lt;da&lt; 1.0 μm) collected on-board diesel- and biodiesel-fuelled buses of the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system of the city of Curitiba, Brazil. Particulate concentrations measured at high sampling rates allowed the capture of fine gradients along the route and the comparison of in-cabin air pollution on buses of different technologies. Of all metrics, BC showed the largest discrepancies, with mean concentrations of 20.1 ± 20.0 μg m−3 and 3.9 ± 26.0 μg m−3 on diesel- and biodiesel-fuelled buses, respectively. Mean PM2.5 concentrations were similar (31.6 ± 28.5 μg m−3 and 29.0 ± 17.8 μg m−3), whilst mean PN concentrations were larger on the biodiesel buses (56,697 ± 26,800 # cm−3 vs. 43,322 ± 32,243 # cm−3). The results are in line with studies on biodiesel emission factors that reported lower BC mass but more particles with smaller diameters. Our hypothesis is that different emission factors of diesel and biodiesel engines reflected in differences of in-cabin particulate concentrations. We found that the passenger exposure during the bus commutes was affected not only by the fuel used but also by the street geometry along the route, with segments with canyon configurations resulting in peak exposure to particulates. The results suggest that i) switching from diesel to biodiesel may help abate commuters’ exposure to BC particles on-board buses of the BRT system, whilst it would need to be complemented with after-treatment technologies to reduce emissions; ii) further reductions in exposure (to peaks in particular) could be achieved by changing bus routes to ones that avoid passing through narrow urban street canyons. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biofuels in the form of water-in-oil (W/O) emulsions are a promising substitution for hydrocarbon fuels, mainly thanks to the micro-explosion phenomenon that occurs under strong heating. Micro-explosion is the atomization of a W/O emulsion drop into daughter droplets because of the water embedded droplets phase change. This atomization leads to the reduction of pollutants and unburnt hydrocarbons emissions. However, micro-explosion is not a systematic phenomenon: indeed, for some cases the water phase change is weak and leads to a partial atomization, called “Puffing”. This paper relates a novel approach to better understand the occurrence of micro-explosion. It consists on the identification of the drop triggering the atomization, called the trigger drop, and measure its properties (temperature, size and position within the emulsion drop) thanks to non-intrusive optical diagnostics. Two colors laser induced fluorescence (LIF2C) is the main method used in this work for temperatures. These temperature measurements showed promising results of both quantitative and qualitative aspects. After the calibration steps and the method validation, it is applied for the temperature measurements of water droplets embedded in oil with the maximum temperature recorded around 130 °C. Using these measurements methods, a correlation is found between quality of atomization (either micro-explosion or puffing) and the properties of the trigger drop (temperature, size and position). When one of these parameters is not optimal, it can indeed be compensated by the others. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Palm oil is one of the most rapidly expanding equatorial crops, which is suitable for feedstock of biodiesel production. In this work, production of methyl esters from palm oil transesterification in a microwave heated continuous flow system was investigated. Choline hydroxide (ChOH) was employed as a green ionic liquid catalyst. The oil to methanol molar ratio, flow rate, power of the microwave, and catalyst loading were varied and optimized by response surface methodology combined with the Box-Behnken design of experiments for maximum biodiesel yield. The ionic liquid proved to be effective in tranesterification of palm oil. The quadratic regression model can be used to forecast the resulting methyl esters content. The optimum condition was identified at molar ratio between oil to methanol of 1:13.2, flow rate of 20 ml/min, microwave power of 800 W and catalyst loading of 6% (w/w), giving the methyl esters content almost 90% in EN 14103 standard test. In addition, most properties of the biodiesel considered were observed to meet the fuel specifications from the ASTM D6751 and Thai standards (community use). Reusability of the ionic liquid for several times was demonstrated before it was contaminated and decomposed, leading to a marked drop in catalytic activity. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Resource nexus research gained ground in the last decade prompted by crises of food and water supply throughout the world. In parallel, bioenergy emerged as an important renewable source worldwide, though it entails a large spectrum of externalities and feedback effects, involving key resources, such as water, land, and biodiversity. Making sense of the complex interactions and measuring all these impacts translates into significant challenges for developing and implementing policies based on a nexus perspective, especially amid divergent interests and normative views. This paper brings an empirical contribution by exploring how reflexive governance concepts can help to understand nexus implementation challenges, and possibly overcome them, based on biofuels policies in Brazil and Germany as case studies. It shows that nexus issues play out differently in each country and discusses how the idea of reflexivity could help to address them, supported by deliberation to reflect upon risks usually assigned to large-scale biomass use and, ultimately, about the underlying assumptions of cause-effect relationships. The cases comparison suggests that cognitive and normative aspects that influenced broader deliberation on biofuels will remain relevant for the deployment of biomass as part of negative emissions strategies in the future. Therefore, it reinforces the need to consider such aspects in nexus research and to expand the debate about the role of bioenergy beyond transformations in the energy sector. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Chemoselective hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of lipids to diesel-like hydrocarbons is important for biomass to biofuel conversion. Here we design a new Ni-based catalyst (Ni/MoO2@Mo2CTx) with extraordinary catalytic performance in the HDO of palmitic acid. To relieve the loss of C atom for Ni-based catalyst, partial oxidation of Mo2CTx MXene was used as a novel support. As a result, the catalytic activity and selectivity ratio of hexadecane/pentadecane (C16/C15) were enhanced over Ni/MoO2@Mo2CTx catalyst, and the major product of palmitic acid HDO is C16, demonstrating a high C atom economy. This facilitated catalytic performance may be ascribed to the synergic effect of metal Ni, Mo2CTx MXene as well as MoO2 active sites. The palmitic acid (–COOH) can convert into hexadecanal (–CHO) and hexadecanol (–CH2OH) over Ni/MoO2@Mo2CTx catalyst in the initial stage. The metal Ni further contributes to the hydrogenation of the hexadecanal to C15 with the cleavage of C–C bonds by decarbonylation (DCO) route. MoO2 nanoparticles obtained from Mo2CTx oxidation accelerate the scission of C–O bonds of the hexadecanol to improve the selectivity of C16 by hydrogenation-dehydration route. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To promote the growth of the biodiesel industry, many countries have started allocating initial inducements to start-up companies to set up the infrastructure for its production facilities. Thus, comprehensive economic assessments are vital to keeping businesses on the right track in the long run. In this present study, net energy ratio (NER) and macroeconomic assessment are investigated using actual data obtained from biodiesel production from waste cooking oil (WCO) by using a semi-industrial plant. The fuel quality produced has complied with the European Biodiesel Standard (EN 14214) and the net energy ratio (NER) calculated was positive, which, in other words, epitomized a competent-designed production practice. Concerning mass balance, 74.3% of biodiesel, 24.0% of by-product glycerol and 8.9% soap were measured. By applying these as baseline values for scale-up production of 3.68 kt per annum, projected values of total production costs, selling price of B10 fuel, net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR) were USD 1.78 million, USD 0.47/kg, USD 1.43 million and 60%, respectively. In summary, these projected values are suggestively lucrative, offering strong business growth for 10 years and capable of withstanding the variations of plant capacity and raw material price. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present study, Loblolly pine biomass residue was converted to bio-oil in a two-step process, consisting of 1) fast pyrolysis in the presence of zeolite ZSM-5 as a catalyst to produce pyrolysis oil, 2) hydrogenation of pyrolysis oil using formic acid as the hydrogen source in presence of Ru/activated carbon catalyst. Pyrolysis oils were analyzed by 13C, 31P and HSQC-NMR and the results revealed that the zeolite-induced catalytic fast pyrolysis process led to effective demethoxylation, producing more catechol and p-hydroxy-phenyl hydroxyl groups in the bio-oils, resulting in a decrease in the methoxyl group content by about 85 % and rich aromatic structures in the pyrolysis oils. The properties of pyrolysis oil with and without zeolite were in the bio-oil range. Hydrogenated pyrolysis oil showed that 79 % of the aromatic protons are eliminated and 87 % of protons are aliphatic in nature, with no oxygen attached to the α-carbon. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present study is to investigate the suitability of Lemon Peel Oil (LPO) as a partial substitution to a conventional gasoline engine. LPO is a novel, renewable, and sustainable alternative biofuel derived from lemon rinds. LPO is a promising fuel for SI engine operation as its properties such as lower heating value, air/fuel ratio, and octane rating are comparable to gasoline. This study aims to evaluate the combustion, performance, and emission characteristics of two different gasoline-LPO blends in Port Fuel Injection (PFI) engine. For this purpose, two different blends of LPO, 20% and 40% has been prepared with gasoline by volumetric concentration. A comparative analysis of combustion, performance, and emission characteristics are evaluated in a single-cylinder, four-stroke, PFI engine. The obtained results are compared with the baseline fuel gasoline under various engine loads. For statistical understanding, ANOVA with two factors interaction is performed. The experimental results showed that the LPO20 and LPO40 have similar brake thermal efficiency as compared to gasoline. Kinetic modeling and sensitivity studies for LPO and gasoline laminar flames showed that the improved combustion of LPO could be related to its higher laminar flame speeds compared to gasoline at lean and stoichiometric conditions. There is a reduction in HC and CO emission is observed with the addition of LPO in gasoline for each engine loading condition. However, higher NOx emission is noted with an increase in LPO concentration in the blend. Overall, the experimental investigation showed that LPO is a promising alternative renewable source for PFI engines. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - With the rapid development of spacecraft such as rocket, it is increasingly important to develop high-energy and sustainable fuels. Biofuels synthesized from biomass derivatives provide great convenience for sustainable development. In this work, we reported a route for synthesis of high-energy cyclopropane bio-kerosene by cyclopropanation of myrcene with zinc carbenoid. The reaction conditions including reaction time, reaction temperature, solvent and molar ratio were optimized. Finally, a tricyclic cyclopropane bio-kerosene was synthesized with 69.8% yield under optimum conditions (i.e. zinc carbenoid synthesis temperature of −15 °C, cyclopropanation temperature of 25 °C and solvent of dichloromethane). Importantly, this bio-kerosene possesses a high specific impulse of 328.25 s, much better than the commercial rocket kerosene RP-1, as well as a high net-heat-value of 43.4 MJ/kg and good low-temperature properties. © 2020

AB  - The present work details the effects of injection of higher order alcohols, namely hexanol (Hex) and octanol (Oct) as secondary fuels in a CI engine. The last decade has seen an exponential increase in the carbon emission chief of which have been contributed by fossil fuels. Vegetable oils provide a viable alternative to the current scenario as they can be synthesized easily from nature and can be readily adapted for use in CI engines. Neem oil (NO) is non-edible and widely available and hence taken as a base fuel for this research. The poor properties of neem oil were improved by the addition of novel low viscous biofuel, namely wintergreen oil (WGO). During the course of this research work, a blend containing a mixture of 50% of neat neem oil and 50% of wintergreen oil (NO50-WGO50) was optimized based on trial tests and taken as pilot fuel while Hex and Oct were injected along with intake air as secondary fuels. The alcohols were injected into the engine successively in the 10%, 20%, and 30% (by mass) ratios. Experiments were conducted in a single-cylinder CI engine fabricating 5.2-kW power at a constant speed of 1500 rpm at varying load conditions. It is observed that inferior performance of NO led to more smoke, HC, and CO in comparison to diesel at all the loads and these are improved with NO50-WGO50 blend. Nevertheless, a minor increase in NOx emission was perceived with the blend. Addition of higher order alcohol promoted reduction of both NOx and smoke emission without affecting performance. Among the various combinations, NO50-WGO50 + Hex30 and Oct30 reduced NOx emission by 12% and 9.5% and smoke emission by 13% and 19% respectively. These results are on par with the diesel performance and emission characteristics. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - To elucidate the potential of Chlorococcum oleofaciens KF584224.1, the effects of different ferric ion concentrations (0, 10−7, 10−6, 10−5, 10−4 mol L−1) on growth, lipid accumulation, and fatty acid profile has been studied. The quantity and quality of extracted lipid was also analyzed by gravimetric and gas chromatographic methods, respectively, to evaluate their suitability according to the international standards for biodiesel (ASTM D6751 and EN 14214). An increase in ferric ion concentration up to 10−6 mol L−1 was associated with an increased specific growth rate by 1.83 folds and expanded exponential growth rate by 10 days compared with that in 0 mol L−1 ferric ion concentration. The highest biomass productivity (310.17 ± 2.19 mg L−1 d−1) and lipid productivity (138.81 ± 3.57 mg L−1 d−1) were achieved in culture medium supplemented with 10−6 and 10−5 mol L−1 ferric ion. The proportion of PUFAs and SFAs tends to decrease and increase by enhancing the ferric ion concentration, respectively. Although the quality of biodiesel produced form C. oleofaciens was found to be in accordance with the specifications in the American (ASTM D6751) and European (EN 14214) biodiesel standards, ferric ion supplementation enhanced the lipid characteristics obtained from C. oleofaciens for biodiesel production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work studied the performance of Rh, Pd and Ni supported on Nb2O5 catalysts for hydrodeoxygenation of phenol in the vapor phase. In general, an increase in reduction temperature favored benzene selectivity. For Ni/Nb2O5, this selectivity increased around 50%. The change in reduction temperature also affected the reaction rates. After reduction at 500 °C, there was a decline in these rates for all samples (a 75-fold decrease for Pd/Nb2O5). This behavior was related to structural modifications caused by strong metal-support interaction (SMSI). For Pd sample, the increase in benzene selectivity (around 30%) was related to a partial encapsulation of the metal by NbOx, which led to an electron enrichment of the Pd particles, as indicated by XPS analysis. This alteration caused an enhancement in the adsorption of phenol through its oxygen. For Rh/Nb2O5, the reduction temperature did not change the benzene selectivity. According to TPR-XANES results, Rh is fully reduced for both reduction conditions studied. On other hand, Ni sample was not fully reduced after H2 treatment at 300 °C, as observed in TPR-XANES at Ni K-edge. It was hypothesized that higher reduction temperatures favored the Ni-NbOx interface, which probably improved the oxophilicity of this sample and, consequently, the benzene selectivity. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Waste office paper (WOP), was used to produce microbial lipids using Cryptococcus curvatus. Pretreatment of WOP with 1% (v/v) sulfuric acid removed the lignin without any inhibitor formation and increased the cellulose content. The optimum conditions for enzymatic hydrolysis of WOP were predicted at 92 h, 50 FPU/g cellulase, 50 CBU/g β-glucosidase, 5% substrate loading, 50 mL working volume and 156 rpm using the central composite design. The maximum sugar yield obtained in the validation experiment was 35.3 g/L. Ammonium chloride and yeast extract combination were more suitable for lipid production by C. curvatus with the carbon to nitrogen ratio of 60. A maximum biomass 11.48 ± 0.09 g/L was obtained at 120 h with a lipid yield of 4.95 ± 0.02 g/L. The lipid profile studies reveal the presence of 11 fatty acid methyl esters. These predominantly comprised of (%, w/w) 50.8% oleic acid, 25.7% palmitoleic acid, 7.1% stearic acid, and 6.5% myristic acid. The characteristic features of the biodiesel, such as cetane number, cold performance, density and iodine value met the requirements of the international standard (EN14214). Thus, the WOP could be a potential renewable feedstock to produce microbial lipids which are essential for the future sustainable production of biodiesel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The effects of a new wave-shaped piston bowl design on combustion characteristics and engine out emissions were tested in a heavy duty Diesel engine fueled with conventional Diesel and fossil-free blends containing n-butanol, n-octanol, 2-ethylhexanol, hydrotreated vegetable oil, and rapeseed methyl ester. The compositions of the blends were chosen such that their cetane numbers matched that of fossil Diesel. Engine experiments were performed at four operating points from the European Stationary Cycle, with no modification of engine settings when switching between different fuels. A standard piston with omega geometry was tested using fossil Diesel and the fossil-free nBu30H (30% n-butanol and 70% hydrotreated vegetable oil by volume) blend, and the results obtained were compared to those achieved with the wave piston. In general, the fossil-free blends yielded significantly lower soot emissions than fossil Diesel but slightly higher NOx emissions. Relative to the standard piston, the wave piston accelerated the combustion of both Diesel and fossil-free blends, especially the diffusion combustion. The wave piston's positive effects on thermal efficiency and soot emissions were more pronounced for conventional Diesel fuel than for oxygenated nBu30H. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Crude glycerol, one of the ever-growing by-product of biodiesel industry and is receiving the closest review in recent times because direct disposal of crude glycerol may emerge ecological issues. The renewability, bioavailability and typical structure of glycerol, therefore, discover conceivable application in serving the role of carbon and energy source for microbial biosynthesis of high value products. This conceivable arrangement could find exploitation of crude glycerol as a renewable building block for bio-refineries as it is economically as well as environmentally profitable. In this review, we summarize the uptake and catabolism of crude glycerol by different wild and recombinant microorganism. The chemical and biochemical transformation of crude glycerol into high esteem malic acid by various microbial pathways is also additionally discussed. An extensive investigation in the synthesis of high-value malic acid production from various feed stock which finds applications in cosmeceutical and chemical industries, food and beverages, and to some extent in the field of medical science is also likewise studied. Finally, the open doors for unrefined crude glycerol in serving as a promising abundant energy source for malic acid production in near future have been highlighted. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Although vegetable oils are apparently an advantageous alternative fuel for direct use in traditional diesel engines with no modification necessary, in practice many problems are regularly discussed in the literature including filter clogging, breakage of certain types of injection pumps, and deposits of carbon on the cold parts of engines. Several technological solutions have been proposed to overcome these problems but the majority of papers discuss them individually and have not actually compared them in similar conditions. The purpose of the present study was to use the same experimental device to compare the three most widely recognised technological options for the use of Jatropha curcas vegetable oil as a fuel in a direct injection diesel engine: preheating, blending with diesel, and recirculating exhaust gases. Power output, specific consumption, thermal efficiency and exhaust gas emissions were compared to those of diesel used as the reference. The results obtained were similar for preheated and non-preheated Jatropha oil, but differed from the results obtained with diesel. Similar combustion performance and similar emissions were obtained with a blend of 20% Jatropha oil and diesel to those obtained with diesel alone. Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) with Jatropha oil could lead to fouling in the combustion chamber. In contrast to widely accepted theory, this study also clearly demonstrates that the viscosity of vegetable oil is not the main cause of poorer combustion quality and, consequently, of deposits in the combustion chamber. © 2020

AB  - Abstract: Biodiesel is an alternative sustainable energy source and can be utilized in the compression ignition engine without any changes in the engine design. This research work focuses on the preparation of Calophyllum inophyllum methyl ester through two steps of transesterification process and its implementation in common rail direct injection diesel engines under various fuel injection strategies. At the initial stage of the current research work, two biodiesel blends of 10 vol% and 20 vol% with remaining quantity as diesel have been used as fuel in a diesel engine at a fuel injection pressure of 600 bar at 5%, 10% and 15% pilot injection variations. In the second stage, the study has been extended for the same strategies of injecting the fuel at the rates of 10% and 20% exhaust gas recirculation. All the experimental results are compared with diesel fuel at an injection pressure of 600 bar with 10% pilot injection. The experimental results revealed that an increase in the blend ratio of biodiesel enhances the combustion, performance characteristics and proliferation of pilot injection from 5 to 15% facilitates spontaneous and complete combustion. It is observed that 15% pilot injection quantity of 20 vol% Calophyllum inophyllum methyl ester blend has shown the best performance among the test samples with other injection strategies. The results also showed that the implementation of exhaust gas recirculation at 10% and 20% rates during diesel engine operation is evident in lower performance characteristics with a significant impact on oxides of nitrogen and carbon dioxide emissions.

AB  - The IBE mixture is a potential automotive fuel, and its production by Clostridium beijerinckii DSM 6423, the best known natural IBE producer, is hindered by low productivity and low butanol titer. To alleviate this problem, we cultivated C. beijerinckii DSM 6423 in repeated batches using sugarcane bagasse as a low-cost immobilization agent. Experiments were conducted in 250-mL bottles containing 150 mL P2 medium, glucose, and bagasse. In a fermentation with seven batch cycles (257 h) containing 7.5 g bagasse, glucose (60 g/L) conversion varied between 38% and 98%. In four of the batch cycles, IBE productivity was between 0.22 and 0.28 g/L∙h, and butanol titer reached 6.7–8.6 g/L. In contrast, in a free-cell single-batch cultivation, glucose conversion was limited to 35%, IBE production was slower (0.13 g IBE/L∙h), and butanol titer did not exceed 4.8 g/L. Despite the gains in productivity and butanol titer, further research is needed to elucidate the factors and mechanisms that caused IBE yield to decline during repeated-batch cultivation of C. beijerinckii DSM 6423. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Soot emissions in combustion are unwanted consequences of burning hydrocarbon fuels. The presence of soot during and following combustion processes is an indication of incomplete combustion and has several negative consequences including the emission of harmful particulates and increased operational costs. Efforts have been made to reduce soot production in combustion engines through utilizing oxygenated biofuels in lieu of traditional nonoxygenated feedstocks. The ongoing Co-Optimization of Fuels and Engines (Co-Optima) initiative from the US Department of Energy (DOE) is focused on accelerating the introduction of affordable, scalable, and sustainable biofuels and high-efficiency, low-emission vehicle engines. The Co-Optima program has identified a handful of biofuel compounds from a list of thousands of potential candidates. In this study, a shock tube was used to evaluate the performance of soot reduction of five high-performance biofuels downselected by the Co-Optima program. Current experiments were performed at test conditions between 1,700 and 2,100 K and 4 and 4.7 atm using shock tube and ultrafast, time-resolve laser absorption diagnostic techniques. The combination of shock heating and nonintrusive laser detection provides a state-of-the-art test platform for high-temperature soot formation under engine conditions. Soot reduction was found in ethanol, cyclopentanone, and methyl acetate; conversely, an α-diisobutylene and methyl furan produced more soot compared to the baseline over longer test times. For each biofuel, several reaction pathways that lead towards soot production were identified. The data collected in these experiments are valuable information for the future of renewable biofuel development and their applicability in engines. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - This study reports the first investigation of the systematic introduction of defects in functionalized UiO-66 structures and its effect on their catalytic activities. Indeed, fifteen UiO-66-based MOFs were synthesized and used as catalysts in the esterification reaction of butyric acid in presence of butanol to produce the novel green biofuel additive, butyl butyrate. The samples included three different structures, UiO-66, UiO-66(COOH)2, and UiO-66(NH2), and five different modulation synthesis conditions for each structure yielding a total of fifteen samples. The increase in the modulator acidity or concentration significantly increased the number of missing linkers per cluster, surface area, and pore volume of the three structures. This leads to the increase in the conversion to butyl butyrate to levels higher than those previously achieved with similar systems. The improved conversion in each structure was attributed to the missing-linker defective sites which act as catalytic centers for the activation of butyric acid. However, using organic linkers with uncoordinated Brønsted acid sites boosted the catalytic activity of UiO-66(COOH)2 to levels higher than both counterparts even for lower number of defects, surface area, and pore size. The catalytic reaction was thus proved to be occurring utilizing both the defective sites and the carboxylic functional groups as catalytic centers and a reaction mechanism is proposed based on this assumption. Finally, the choice of the organic linker for the engineering of the MOFs' structure in catalytic applications offers abundant possibilities especially if coupled with the systematic increase in defective sites to overcome challenging diffusion limitations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Costs of producing “advanced” biofuels (those with the lowest GHG and land use impacts) have not decreased in recent years as envisioned by analysts. Despite aggressive policy incentives, no transition to a lower cost mature industry has occurred. Information about the cost dynamics and slow industry emergence is of major interest to policymakers and others seeking to understand the likely success – and cost – of incentive programs. This paper reviews literature on production cost at the plantgate – without considering taxes or delivery costs – for selected biofuel technology pathways using a levelized cost of fuel approach, applying common financing assumptions for capital amortization and converting all values to year 2016 dollars, and examines results in the current low carbon fuel policy context. The average production cost estimate for cellulosic ethanol was $4 per gallon-gasoline equivalent (gge). For drop-in fuels, the pyrolysis-biocrude-hydro treatment pathway had the lowest average production cost estimate at about $3.25/gge. Biomass to liquid (BTL) production cost estimates averaged $3.80/gge, while hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) – the sole fuel studied gaining commercial traction – averaged about $3.70/gge. Estimate ranges did not allow any definitive rank ordering of the fuels by production cost. Production cost estimates are higher in later than in earlier publications for non-HEFA fuels due primarily to higher costs for feedstock and capital expenditure components. This may reflect learning from early but largely unsuccessful commercialization efforts that yielded more realistic (and higher cost) information and detail on feedstock provision and conversion processes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study compared the combustion characteristics between bioliquid and heavy fuel oil using a 0.7 MWth pilot furnace and a 75 MWe power generation boiler. The bioliquid flame in the pilot furnace was clearer and more transparent, but higher gas temperature in the burner zone, compared to the heavy fuel oil flame. It might be due to higher sooting tendency of the heavy fuel oil flame. Due to the lower N and S contents in bioliquid, NOx and SOx emissions were significantly reduced in the bioliquid combustion tests. For the bioliquid demonstration in a 75 MWe power generation boiler, bioliquid firing led to decrease in heat flux to the furnace wall, so the furnace exit gas temperature was increased, comparing to the heavy fuel oil firing. Subsequently, the heat absorption in the first pass of the boiler was increased and finally it led to the increase in reheater de-superheating water spray flow rate. Significant reductions in NOx and SOx emissions were achieved with bioliquid firing. The operation and measured data in the bioliquid demonstration tests showed the successful operation of the unit, and no operational or emissions limitations were identified. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Aldol condensation between furfural (FA) and MIBK is used to synthesize branched bio-jet-fuel precursors. It remains difficult to design hybrid solid bases to efficiently promote this reaction, because only strong basic sites can activate MIBK. Different basic species were immobilized into zirconia/carbon hybrid supports by thermal decomposition of GO/UiO materials loaded with corresponding alkane (earth) nitrides. Only Cs immobilized zirconia/carbon (CsZC) could efficiently promote this reaction, while counterparts with Li, Mg and Ca species showed little activity over condensation between MIBK and FA. Optimized CsZC showed excellent FA conversion and selectivity towards desired products (88.6% in yields of FMIBK in 6 h at 130 °C). Two indirect proofs were provided to check the influence of basic strength on the catalytic performance, and only Cs samples had enough strong basic sites to accelerate the reaction. After modified with octyl groups, hydrophobic CsZC were reused for 4th cycle while retaining most of its original activity. Functionalization with organosilanes increased the hydrophobicity of the surface, which had dramatical promotion on activity, selectivity, and stability. It was the first time to run recycling experiments for this reaction, to afford the demands for chemical sustainability. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Organosulfonic acid functionalized montemorillonite-MMT (K10 and cloisite Na+) were prepared by different methodologies: (a) one-pot organosilylation or sulfonation, and (b) two-step organosilylation followed by sulfonation or oxidation. The physicochemical characterization ensured the success of the selected methodologies to promote HSO3-functionalization including high S contents (2.84 mmol S/g) and acidities up to 6.03 mmol H+/g (K10_PhSO3H). All the organosulfonic acid functionalized MMT were tested as acid catalyst in the esterification of free fatty acids in a hybrid feedstock model. Conversions of 100% were obtained after 60 min for K10_PhTESO3H, K10_SO3H, Cloi_PhTESO3H and Cloi_H2SO4, in accordance with the acid character of these catalysts, prepared by one-pot and two-step methodologies involving a sulfonation step. The MMT catalysts obtained by direct sulfonation exhibited the highest TOF whereas those obtained by two-step organosilylation-sulfonation showed the highest stability and reusability. The increase of FFA carbon chain length led to higher conversions, showing the prevalence of inductive effect and absence of steric effects on the esterification mechanism using these organosulfonic acid functionalized catalysts. Moreover, K10-PhSO3H was applied as solid acid catalyst in a simultaneous (trans) esterification of different feedstock types for biodiesel production giving up to 100% of FAMEs under moderate conditions. © 2019

AB  - Recently, much attention has been paid to the direct use of acetone-n-butanol-ethanol (ABE) as a biofuel. However, the skeletal mechanism of ABE for engine applications was rarely reported. Therefore, a skeletal mechanism to predict the combustion and emission characteristics of diesel-ABE blends in engines was developed in this study. A reduced mechanism considering the oxidation of acetone, n-butanol, and ethanol was first established on the basis of the methods of directed relation graph with error propagation and sensitivity analysis, computational singular perturbation, and reaction pathway analysis. It was then combined with a reduced n-heptane/toluene mechanism with soot formation mechanism embedded and a reduced NOx formation mechanism. After optimizing the reaction rate constants of the key reactions in the coupled mechanism, the skeletal mechanism of n-heptane/toluene-acetone-n-butanol-ethanol (referred as HT-ABE) consisting of 127 species and 507 reactions was finally generated and validated against ignition delay times, premixed flame species profiles, and three-dimensional (3D) engine simulations. The results show that the combustion and emission characteristics of diesel-ABE blends are well reproduced by the current mechanism. It is indicated that the newly developed HT-ABE mechanism can be applied to simulate practical ABE combustion in a diesel engine. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This work focuses on the development of a highly compact and robust chemical reaction mechanism for unsaturated furan oxidation in internal combustion engines. Recently, furans have gathered much attention in the research community as they are second-generation biofuels that do not compete with food supplies, unlike first-generation biofuels. Moreover, they are oxygenated and highly resistant to knocking when compressed. A four-component chemical reaction mechanism, consisting of furan, 2-methylfuran, 2,5-dimethylfuran, and toluene, is developed to simulate the combustion of unsaturated furans under engine-relevant conditions. First, a detailed furan, 2-methylfuran, and 2,5-dimethylfuran reaction mechanism from the literature is selected and reduced under engine-relevant conditions. Sensitivity analysis and the species rate of production are employed to identify the major reaction pathways of the respective furanic components under different conditions. After which, isomer lumping and reaction lumping are used to further reduce the size of the major reaction pathways and the skeletal major reaction pathways for furan, 2-methylfuran, and 2,5-dimethylfuran are included to a compact toluene base mechanism from the literature to form the final mechanism, consisting of only 62 species among 228 reactions. Subsequently, the pre-exponential A factors in Arrhenius equations of the furanic reactions are optimized via an in-house multiobjective nondominated sorting genetic algorithm, and successively, the generalized polynomial chaos is introduced to model the uncertainty of the input rate coefficient and its propagation in ignition behavior. The performance of the different furanic components in the mechanism is then validated against experimental data from the literature. The predicted results are in reasonable agreement with experimental results considering the compact size of the developed mechanism and the challenge of multiobjective optimization. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a C4, warm season, perennial native grass that has been strongly recommended as an ideal biofuel feedstock. Accurate forecasting of switchgrass yield across a geographically diverse region and under future climate conditions is essential for determining realistic future ethanol production from switchgrass. This study compiled a switchgrass database through reviewing the existing literature from field trials across the U.S. Using observed switchgrass data, a process-based model (ALMANAC) was developed. The ALMANAC simulation results showed that crop management had more effect on yield than location. The ALMANAC model consists of functional relationships that provide a better understanding of interactions among plant physiological processes and environmental factors (water, soil, climate, and nutrients) giving realistic predictions in different climate conditions. This model was used to quantify the impacts of climate change on switchgrass yields. Simulated lowland switchgrass would have more yield increases between Illinois and Ohio in future (2021-2050) under both Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 pathways with low N fertilizer inputs than high N fertilizer inputs. There was no significant effect of climate variability on upland simulated yields, which means that N fertilization is a key factor in controlling upland switchgrass yields under future climate conditions. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Considering the rapid decline in the amount of fossil fuels and the large quantities of emissions they release into the atmosphere, which are responsible for global warming, researchers are looking for alternative sources of energy. Biodiesel is an alternative source that is suitable for use as an alternative to diesel and can result in a reduction in the level of pollutants released. It has been observed that trans-esterified cooking oil can be combusted in an internal combustion engine like different biofuels with no major adjustments. Recent studies have proved that with the addition of nanoadditives, the performance and emissions have a very good impact on the environment. In the present experimental study, trans-esterified vegetable oil was used as biodiesel, along with the addition of nanoadditives (alumina) to diesel, and the outcomes were compared with baseline diesel operation. The nanoadditive was blended in the fuel mixture alongside an appropriate surfactant. Various blends were made and used for this investigation. Performance, emission and combustion parameters were studied using a single-cylinder four-stroke diesel engine at various loads, keeping a constant compression ratio of 18. Due to the availability of oxygen in the biodiesel and the better blending capacities of the nanoparticles, it was observed that there was a reduction in the opacity, CO and HC emissions; however, there was a small increment in NOx. It was also observed that the specific fuel consumption decreased with the increase in in-cylinder pressures. The outcomes showed that the addition of alumina in the diesel-biodiesel mixture has a positive overall effect on the environment. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Clean energy and renewable fine chemicals including biofuels, hydrogen, and bicarbonates are critical for a sustainable and green future. In this study, the integrated production of naturally separated high density liquid biofuels (mainly C7 and C14 olefins), hydrogen gas, and fine chemicals is achieved in an electrochemical cell under ambient conditions. Biofuels are obtained by anodic decarboxylation of the carboxylates, hydrogen is obtained by cathodic reduction of water, and fine chemicals are obtained by the reaction between the alkaline aqueous solution and the anodic carbon dioxide products. An environmentally friendly and low-cost aqueous substitution method is employed to prepare self-supporting Pt nanospheres on 3D porous titanium sponge (Pt@TS) composite electrodes for such an integrated electrolysis. A Pt@TS anode with abundant Pt(100) facets exhibits enhanced activity and stability for electrocatalytic biofuel production as compared with commercial Pt anodes. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Together with solar, wind, and hydro renewable energy sources (RES), biomass constitutes an integral part of the high-renewables electricity systems. Considerable feedstocks for electricity generation are process-based residues. Ukraine is the world leader in sunflower seed production, therefore, husk (a by-product of oil production) is a promising biofuel for combustion- based power plants. The plants consume primarily electricity and fossil fuels (natural gas or fuel oil) for steam production. Their usage affects the edible oil production cost and impacts on climate change. The above facts force us to look for alternatives. By-product (husk) utilization can reduce exhaustible energy consumption (fossil fuels and grid electricity) and mitigate climate change. The aim of the study is to make an energy and ecological assessment of biomass energy supply systems. Specifically, the electricity and heat consumption of Ukrainian sunflower oil mills is investigated. Different options of cogeneration systems are analyzed. The preferable mode of combustion-based husk combined heat and power plants is to meet their own heat demand and to sell surplus electricity. Relative gross income and carbon dioxide emission reductions are calculated. Our results show that husk utilization can meet electricity and heat requirements of edible plants. The surplus electricity may be sold to the grid. Husk combined heat and power plants may result in reduction of carbon dioxide by 200–300% and an increase of total income by 24.7–65.7% (compared to conventional energy supply systems). © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The decline of industrial manufacturing left large areas of vacant land in the peri-urban belts of many European cities, becoming an economic, social and environmental concern. In the meantime, available fertile soils are being over-used to produce energy crops, and municipal organic wastes are accumulating in landfills, actions that hamper the development of wealth-creating and sustainable societies. Phytomanagement has emerged as a valuable in-situ strategy for the management of peri-urban vacant spaces, able to restore their fundamental ecosystem services. The field experiment described here was undertaken to study the potential of bio-stabilised material (BSM) obtained from commingled municipal solid wastes, both for Brassica napus (rapeseed) crop production and to improve the health/functioning of peri-urban vacant soil as a first step toward urban greening. Three months before sowing, soils were amended with 0, 50 and 100 t FW BSM ha–1. Data were gathered on the physiology and growth of B. napus at the BBCH-16-17 (57 days) and BBCH-89 (260 days) phenological stages. The activity, biomass, and functional diversity of soil microbial communities were measured concomitantly. Overall, the results showed that the BSM-amended soils became more productive and functional than the unamended soils. At the plant level, the leaf area of B. napus plants was significantly increased at the BBCH-16-17 stage, which later, at BBCH-89 stage, translated to a higher yield. At the soil level, mainly microbial activities related to C and N turnover increased after BSM amendment. This was key in satisfying the oilseed nutritional requirements under our experimental conditions. This innovative study advocates for a circular economy and shows that the combination of BSM amendment and B. napus can be efficacious for the redevelopment of peri-urban vacant soils. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Anaerobic digestion of crude glycerol from biodiesel production is a feasible way for methane production. However, crude glycerol (CG) contains impurities, such as long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) that can inhibit methanogenic microorganisms. Ultrasound promotes the hydrolysis of LCFA and deagglomerates the microorganisms in biological flocs. Furthermore, Aspergillus niger and Escherichia coli produce lipases capable of degrading LCFA. This study aims at improving the methane yield from anaerobic digestion by coupling with ultrasound or E. coli/A. niger biodegradation. The effect of the different treatments was first assessed in a perfectly mixed batch reactor (PMBR), using diluted CG at concentrations of 0.2%, 1.7%, and 3.2% (v/v). Later, the best conditions were replicated in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor to simulate full-scale practical applications. Experiments in the PMBR showed that ultrasound or A. niger biodegradation steps improved methane yield up to 11% for 0.2% CG and 99% for 1.7% CG, respectively. CG biodegradation by E. coli inhibited the subsequent anaerobic digestion for all concentrations tested. Using a UASB digester, ultrasonic treatment of CG led to an average increase of 29% in methane production. The application of ultrasound led to a lower accumulation of propionic acid in the digested material and increased biogas production. On the other hand, an average 77% increase in methane production was achieved using a preliminary CG biodegradation step by A. niger, when operated at a loading rate of 2.9 kg COD m-3 day-1. Under these conditions, an energy gain of 0.48 kWh day-1, with the production of the 0.434 m3 CH4 kg-1 CODremoval and 0.573 m3 CH4 kg-1 VS, and a biogas quality of 73% in methane were obtained. The digested material was analyzed for the detection and quantification of added-value by-products in order to obtain a broad assessment of the CG valorization through anaerobic digestion. In some experiments, propionic and oxalic acid were detected. However, the accumulation of propionic caused the inhibition of the acetogenic and methanogenic microorganisms. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The main scope of this study was to evaluate continuous fast pyrolysis method and the quality of bio-oil produced from Prosospis juliflora on a self-designed Blade Type Reactor (BTR). The bio-oil was produced at 450 °C and characterised for ultimate and proximate analysis. For each batch of biomass feed stock, the BTR had conversion efficiency into bio-oil of 50%, 19% syngas, and the rest biochar. The bio-oil produced was characterised by TGA, FTIR, GC-MS, 1H NMR and 13C NMR to understand the thermal behaviour and evaluate chemical composition. The results from TGA analysis indicate that the bio-oil contains about 6% wt of water and its constituents are stable up to 160 °C, before starting to degrade completely by 360 °C. The bio-oil contain more than 20 different organic compounds, including phenolic, carbonyl, furfural and toluene. As a blending agent, the performance of the 35% bio-oil blended diesel was slightly higher than pure fossil diesel when the engine was operated at full load condition. Further, the bio-oil exhibited antibacterial properties, tested against a few selected bacterial pathogens. In brief, the bio-oil from P. juliflora has potential as a blending agent to diesel primarily (for biodiesel) and secondly for some antibacterial purposes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A simple, inexpensive, and fast colorimetric spot test is proposed for quantification of biodiesel in diesel blends. The procedure was based on formation of a violet complex between Fe(III) and the hydroxamate ion generated by the reaction of the alkyl esters characteristic of biodiesel with hydroxylamine. The analytical measurements were based on digital images acquired using a smartphone camera and converted to RGB values using a free application software (PhotoMetrix® 1.6). Values of the G channel corresponding to the intensities of the reflected radiation were taken as analytical parameter because of the complementarity with the absorption spectrum of the Fe(III)/hydroxamate complex. The effects of the reagents concentrations were evaluated by a Box-Bhenken experimental design and the optimized condition was 0.20 mol L−1 hydroxylamine, 0.30 mol L−1 NaOH, and 5.0 mmol L−1 Fe2(SO4)3. A linear response range was achieved from 3.0 to 30.0% (v/v) of biodiesel, described by equation G = 59.4 + 1.72 C (r = 0.999). The coefficient of variation and the limit of detection (99.7% confidence level) were estimated at 0.9% (n = 10) and 1.0% (v/v) of biodiesel, respectively. The proposed procedure consumed only 10 µL of sample, 830 μg NH2OH.HCl, and 110 μg Fe(III) and generated ca. 1.0 mL of residue per determination. The results for determination of biodiesel in diesel blends agreed with those obtained by the official method EN14078 at the 95% confidence level. The proposed procedure also allows monitoring formation of fatty acid methyl esters during the transesterification reaction. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - There are tons of waste tyres produced each year globally. Production of oil from the waste tyre not only manages the wastes but also produces fuels for compression ignition engines. In this investigation, a novel approach developed by Green Distillation Technologies in Australia was used to convert whole end of life tyres (ELTs) into carbon, steel, and tyre oil. The physicochemical properties of the tyre oil are similar to diesel fuel, and the fuel is miscible with diesel in any blended ratio. An engine experiment was conducted on a EURO IIIA diesel engine. All experiments were performed at constant speed and four different engine loads. Two blends (10% and 20%) of tyre oil were compared to reference diesel fuel. Exhaust emissions, including gaseous emissions, particulate matter (PM) and particulate number (PN) were investigated. The results indicate simultaneous reductions in both diesel PM and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions with the tyre oil blends when compared to diesel. NOx emissions were reduced by approximately 30% with both blends with respect to diesel. The reduction in PM and PN emissions were in the range of 35–60% and 5–20%, respectively. Carbon monoxide (CO) were increased by ∼ 10% compared to the reference diesel except at quarter load. Insignificant change in brake power (BP), brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) and brake thermal efficiency (BTE) were observe with the tyre oil blends. The engine remained compliant with its EURO IIIA guidelines during the use of the tyre oil blends. Based on the engine performance and emission result, the tyre oil could be alternative to traditional diesel fuel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Indicators, such as the energy balance (EB) and greenhouse gases emissions avoided (GHGEA), are frequently used to evaluate the benefits and sustainability of biofuels. Many important papers and reports have been published in recent years to demonstrate the environmental and energetic benefits of biofuels, such as ethanol from sugar cane. EB and GHGEA often include other sugar cane products, such as electricity and bagasse. The anaerobic digestion of vinasse can generate considerable amounts of biogas but is not a common practice in Brazil. This study evaluates the potential benefits to the EB and GHGEA of ethanol by the production of biogas from vinasse and its use to produce electricity or biomethane. Biomethane can be injected on the Natural Gas Grid or used as a fossil diesel oil replacement in the mill operations of harvesting and transportation of sugar cane. The results show that biogas from vinasse can represent improvement in both indicators, which ranges from 3.5% improvement in EB by electricity generation with biogas to 27.5% improvement in GHGEA by replacing diesel in the mill operations. © 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog,39:e13226, 2020. © 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - The hazards to health and the environment associated with the transportation sector include smog, particulate matter, and greenhouse gas emissions. Conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into biofuels has the potential to provide significant amounts of infrastructure-compatible liquid transportation fuels that reduce those hazardous materials. However, the development of these technologies is inefficient, due to: (i) the lack of a priori fuel property consideration, (ii) poor shared vocabulary between process chemists and fuel engineers, and (iii) modern and future engines operating outside the range of traditional autoignition metrics such as octane or cetane numbers. In this perspective, we describe an approach where we follow a “fuel-property first” design methodology with a sequence of (i) identifying the desirable fuel properties for modern engines, (ii) defining molecules capable of delivering those properties, and (iii) designing catalysts and processes that can produce those molecules from a candidate feedstock in a specific conversion process. Computational techniques need to be leveraged to minimize expenses and experimental efforts on low-promise options. This concept is illustrated with current research information available for biomass conversion to fuels via catalytic fast pyrolysis and hydrotreating; outstanding challenges and research tools necessary for a successful outcome are presented. © 2020

AB  - Corncob is a kind of abundant lignocellulosic biomass. One of the bottlenecks in utilization of corncob in fermentation industry is many microorganisms cannot ferment xylose, which is the main component of corncob hydrolysate. Here we identified a novel oily yeast strain AM2352 of Rhodotorula taiwanensis, which could effectively convert corncob hydrolysate into microbial lipid. Notably, the fatty acid synthase alpha-subunit of R. taiwanensis has two acyl carrier protein (ACP) domains, which may be involved in high-level oil contents in its cells. Based on a 5-L fermentation analysis, the coefficient of lipid production was 55.8 g oil per kilogram of corncob. Long-chain fatty acids (C16–C18) were the main components of the intracellular lipid accumulated by the yeast strain AM2352. Over 81.5% of the extracted oil could be converted into biodiesel. This work not only provides an inspiring information into the utilization of corncob hydrolysate by the yeast strain AM2352 for microbial lipid production, but also probably promotes biofuel production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Palm oil mill effluent (POME) was tested as a substrate to produce hydrogen by dark fermentation. Two microbial consortia and a pure culture of Clostridium beijerinckii (ATCC 8260) were cultured anaerobically in raw, diluted and hydrolyzed POME to compare biohydrogen production yields in all three media. Experiments were done in 15 mL Hungate tubes containing 5 mL of medium and 1 mL of inoculum. When Clostridium beijerinckii was cultivated at 30 °C in the hydrolyzed POME (P003), containing 7.5 g/L of sucrose, during 8 days of fermentation and 20 % of the inoculum, the maximum biohydrogen production yield was 4.62 LH2/Lmed. Consortium C3 also showed the best production in hydrolyzed POME while consortium C6 achieved its maximum production in raw POME. This effluent is a potential substrate for biohydrogen production. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The sustainability of biodiesel adoption in diesel engines are dependent on its environmental friendliness relative to lower pollutant emissions. Biodiesel was produced from extracted Parinari polyandra oil via alkali catalyzed methanolysis. Performance and emission analysis of a diesel engine was conducted on a diesel engine, operated under different operating conditions, using varied Parinari polyandra biodiesel blends. Exhaust emissions, like total hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides were measured. The biodiesel properties were found to be similar to fossil diesel. B10 was found to be the optimal blend in improving the engine performance in terms of speed, power and thermal efficiency. B30 demonstrated stable performance characteristics without any modification of the diesel engine. The exhaust emissions from biodiesel blends combustion were found to be lower than that of diesel, except nitrogen oxides. High percentage reduction of greenhouse gases, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, was recorded at 81.7% and 65.7%, respectively. The utilization of Parinari polyandra biodiesel for engine application was found to be a viable means of heightening adoption of sustainable biofuels and minimizing pollutant emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Gaseous streams in biorefineries have been undervalued and underutilized. In cellulosic biorefineries, coproduced biogas is assumed to be combusted alongside lignin to generate process heat and electricity. Biogas can instead be upgraded to compressed biomethane and used as a transportation fuel. Capturing CO2-rich streams generated in biorefineries can also contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation goals. We explore the economic and life-cycle GHG impacts of biogas upgrading and CO2 capture and storage (CCS) at ionic liquid-based cellulosic ethanol biorefineries using biomass sorghum. Without policy incentives, biorefineries with biogas upgrading systems can achieve a comparable minimum ethanol selling price (MESP) and reduced GHG footprint ($1.38/liter gasoline equivalent (LGE) and 12.9 gCO2e/MJ) relative to facilities that combust biogas onsite ($1.34/LGE and 24.3 gCO2e/MJ). Incorporating renewable identification number (RIN) values advantages facilities that upgrade biogas relative to other options (MESP of $0.72/LGE). Incorporating CCS increases the MESP but dramatically decreases the GHG footprint (-21.3 gCO2e/MJ for partial, -110.7 gCO2e/MJ for full CCS). The addition of CCS also decreases the cost of carbon mitigation to as low as $52-$78/t CO2, depending on the assumed fuel selling price, and is the lowest-cost option if both RIN and California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard credits are incorporated. ©

AB  - Algae biomass has recently attracted the attention of the green energy industry as a raw material for biofuels production. Their high-water content has led to the choice of hydrothermal liquefaction as a suitable way to convert them into bio-oil. From algae species to bio-oil as fuel, many steps are required, including the selection of algae species and process parameters (including catalysts), the liquefaction process, product separation, recovery of crude bio-oil, and subsequent upgrading (if the goal is to use the bio-oil as transportation fuel). This review gives some biochemical, elemental, and inorganic compositions of algae. The reaction mechanism of hydrothermal liquefaction is briefly described, with an emphasis on the influence of process parameters on the yield and quality of the crude bio-oil. The use of organic solvents as reaction media or for recovery of crude bio-oil from product mixtures is discussed. The research work on the catalytic hydrothermal upgrading of algae liquefied crude bio-oil in recent years is reviewed, and some conclusions are put forward. According to recent reports, there is a section devoted to the techno-economic analysis of the hydrothermal liquefaction process. Finally, the challenges that future research and new development strategies may face are proposed. ©

AB  - To achieve a sustainable production of food and feed production, inexpensive carbon and nutrient sources are needed. In the present study, biologically upgraded biogas is coupled with electrochemically extracted nitrogen from digested biowaste to cultivate mixed methanotrophs as protein source. Results showed that an increase from less than 5 μgCu2+/L to 100 μgCu2+/L increased the biomass production by 41%. Microbial analysis revealed that the dominated Methylomonas spp. followed by Methylophilus spp. created a specialized community for high CH4 assimilation. Moreover, duplicate semi-continuous fermenters run for 120 days validating the efficiency of alternative carbon and nitrogen feedstocks at long-term operation. As for dry cell weight (DCW) production, more than 2.5 g-DCW/L were produced using biologically upgraded biogas and electrochemically extracted nitrogen. Furthermore, the protein content and amino acid profile (&gt;50% of DCW) demonstrated that the microbial biomass pose the characteristics to be used as animal feed additive. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Single cell oils or microbial lipids produced by oleaginous microorganisms are being utilized for various applications such as nutrition, fuels and valuable chemicals. However, after the extraction of value added products from microbial cells, the residue is generally burned or discarded. In the present study, synthesis of a novel bio-based solid acid catalyst from waste yeast residue has been carried out through sulfonation for biodiesel production. The obtained yeast residue based solid acid (YSA) catalyst showed higher fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield of 96.2 wt % for waste cooking oil at 60 °C and 94.8 wt % for yeast oil at 70 °C with 4 wt % catalyst concentration and 10:1 methanol to oil molar ratio. The FAME profile indicated the presence of elevated monounsaturated fatty acid content with improved oxidative stability and cold flow properties. The catalyst revealed high catalytic activity, high thermal stability and can be regenerated with its activity maintained up to four cycles. Furthermore, the biodiesel properties were abided with the international fuel standards. © 2020

AB  - Waste streams have emerged as potential feedstocks for biofuel production via microbial bioconversion. Metabolic engineering of the microalga Phaeodactylum tricornutum in its lipid biosynthetic pathways has been conducted with an aim to improve lipid production. However, there has been only limited achievement in satisfying biofuel demands by utilising extracellular organic carbons from low-cost waste streams. Herein, we present a successive staged cultivation mode, based on a previously engineered strain that co-overexpresses two key triacylglycerol biosynthesis genes. We first optimised microalgal biomass and lipid production by using food waste hydrolysate and crude glycerol as the cultivation media. Food waste hydrolysate (5% v/v) is a low-cost organic carbon source for enhanced microalgal biomass production, and the resulting lipid concentration was 1.08-fold higher with food-waste hydrolysate than that of the defined medium. Additionally, the resultant lipid concentration after using crude glycerol (100 mM) was 1.24-fold higher than that using the defined medium. Two carbon feeding modes (hybrid and sequential) were also performed to investigate the potential of engineered P. tricornutum with preliminary mechanistic analyses. The biodiesel properties of lipids produced in the hybrid mode were evaluated for potential application prospects. Collectively, this study demonstrates a waste stream utilisation strategy for efficient and sustainable microalgal biofuel production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The valorization of lignin is critical for the economic viability of the bioeconomy. Microbial metabolism is advantageous for handling the myriad of aromatic compounds resulting from lignin chemical or enzymatic depolymerization. Coupling aromatic metabolism to fatty acid biosynthesis makes possible the production of biofuels, oleochemicals, and other fine/bulk chemicals derived from lignin. Our previous work identified Cutaneotrichosporon oleaginosus as a yeast that could accumulate nearly 70% of its dry cell weight as lipids using aromatics as a sole carbon source. Expanding on this, other oleaginous yeast species were investigated for the metabolism of lignin-relevant monoaromatics. Thirty-six oleaginous yeast species from the Phaff yeast collection were screened for growth on several aromatic compounds representing S-, G-, and H- type lignin. The analysis reported in this study suggests that aromatic metabolism is largely segregated to the Cutaenotrichosporon, Trichosporon, and Rhodotorula clades. Each species tested within each clade has different properties with respect to the aromatics metabolized and the concentrations of aromatics tolerated. The combined analysis suggests that Cutaneotrichosporon yeast are the best suited to broad spectrum aromatic metabolism and support its development as a model system for aromatic metabolism in yeast. © 2020, Society for Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology.

AB  - One of the challenging tasks for the researchers is to identify alternative renewable energy feedstocks which can be used as a substitute for fossil fuel to meet the increasing demand for energy, reduce the depletion of fossil fuel reserves and eliminate the increasing concerns of environmental impact. The 2nd generation poppy (Papaver somniferum) seed oil (PSO) can be considered as one of the feedstocks which would be low cost and does not compete with food crops for biodiesel production. In this study, biodiesel production was conducted in 2 stage processes which consist of acid and base–catalysed esterification and transesterification to reduce the free fatty acid (FFA) content of poppy seed oil (PSO) and to increase the yield of poppy seed oil methyl ester (PSOME), respectively. To determine the maximum yield of methyl ester, different parameters that influence the production of methyl ester, namely the molar ratio of methanol to oil (5.0:1–7.0:1), catalyst loading (0.5–1.5 wt.%), reaction temperature (40–80 °C) and time (60–120 min) were investigated under the transesterification reaction. The results found that methanol to oil molar ratio of 6.0:1, catalyst loading of 1.0 (wt.%), reaction temperature of 60 °C and reaction time of 90 min were observed to be the optimum process parameters for maximising the yield of PSOME at a constant speed of 720 rpm. In these conditions, the maximum methyl ester yield was found to be about 93 %. The gas chromatography (GC) analysis was conducted to evaluate the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) composition of the PSOME. Furthermore, the physico-chemical properties of the PSOME were evaluated and characterised using ASTM and EN standards for biodiesel. It was found that PSO can be used as a potential feedstock for biodiesel production as most of the physico-chemical properties are within the ASTM and EN standards. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Large-scale deployment of both biochemical and thermochemical routes for advanced biofuels production is seen as a key climate change mitigation option. This study addresses techno-economic and environmental aspects of advanced liquid biofuels production alternatives via biomass gasification and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis integrated to a typical sugarcane distillery. The thermochemical route comprises the conversion of the residual lignocellulosic fraction of conventional sugarcane (bagasse and straw), together with eucalyptus and energy-cane as emerging lignocellulosic biomass options. This work promotes an integrated framework to simulate the mass and energy balances of process alternatives and incorporates techno-economic analyses and sustainability assessment methods based on a life-cycle perspective. Results show that integrated biorefineries provide greenhouse gas emission reduction between 85-95% compared to the fossil equivalent, higher than that expected from a typical sugarcane biorefinery. When considering avoided emissions by cultivated area, biorefinery scenarios processing energy-cane are favored, however at lower economic performance. Thermochemical processes may take advantage of the integration with the typical sugarcane mills and novel biofuels policies (e.g., RenovaBio) to mitigate some of the risks linked to the implementation of new biofuel technologies. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - We report herein a catalytic deoxygenation strategy that allows the direct removal of oxygen atoms from triglycerides by lowering the activation energy through the use of metal-based catalysts. Activation energies were investigated by TG analysis, employing fatty acid salts as model compounds. Introducing different metal atoms into carboxyl groups has a substantial effect on the dynamic pyrolytic behavior, and decomposition activation energies varied in the range 80–260 kJ/mol. The catalytic cracking of soybean oil using SnO as a representative catalyst has been investigated in a 5 L reactor, whereby the catalyst lowered the decomposition temperature by approximately 40 °C and gave a conversion rate of approximately 66 wt%. A catalytic conversion mechanism has been proposed based on the results of TG-FTIR, GC, and GC-MS analyses. The pyrolysis products from the deoxygenation process had a high alkene content, endowing them with great potential for conversion into cyclic hydrocarbons used in real aviation fuels. Such conversion through aromatization and hydrogenation over ZSM-5 and Raney Ni catalyst has been investigated. Overall, a new refining process, including conversion of triglycerides to alkanes and terminal alkenes catalyzed by metal compounds, furnishing viable aviation and diesel fuels, is reported. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In China, plantations of Xanthoceras sorbifolium Bunge are grown on more than 170,000 ha. X. sorbifolium is a promising bioenergy crop as its seed oil is a suitable feedstock for biodiesel. In this work, X. sorbifolium seeds were collected from 26 populations distributed over a wide geographic area across northern China. Differences were found among accessions in seeds oil contents, fatty acids profiles and quality indexes of the biodiesel. Seed oil content was found to vary from 56.54% to 76.27%. Most of the accessions showed 60–70 % oil content, and a few accessions showed more than 70 % oil content. As revealed by gas chromatography, the contents of the three major fatty acids were found to significantly vary in the seed oils is linoleic acid (C18:2) (39.83–46.05 %), followed by oleic acid (C18:1) (26.02–33.04 %) and erucic acid (C22:1) (7.71–8.99 %). In respect to unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAS) in each of estimated classes of accessions was predominant and most abundant in broad range of minimum–maximum values from 44.42% to 51.00%. The X. sorbifolium accessions were distinctly grouped into 3 clusters on the basis of the Ward's hierarchical clustering method. After analyzing these indicators, it showed clearly that Naiman (P9) provenance is the best performer in produce biodiesel can be selected as a source of planting material, followed by Anqiu (P18). And the relationship between these parameters and the environment was determined, the results indicate that latitude, MAT (mean annual temperature) and longitude are the three key environmental factors affecting the fatty acid profile of X. sorbifolium. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This research was focused on the valorisation of glycerol, exploring the feasibility of an efficient route for oxygenated additives production based on its etherification with bio-butanol. A home-made BEA zeolite sample with a tuneable acidity has been proposed as the catalytic system, being tested in a stirred reactor under different etherification conditions. Although a reaction temperature as high as 200 °C resulted to be beneficial in terms of glycerol conversion (~90%), only by operating at milder conditions the product selectivity to glycerol-ethers can be better controlled, in order to obtain a bio-fuel complying with the requirements for mixing with fossil diesel or biodiesel, without any need of purification from large amount of by-products. A comprehensive identification of all the compounds formed during the reaction was performed by a GC–MS analysis, on the basis of the complex network of consecutive and parallel reaction paths leading not only to the desired ethers, but also to many side products not detected in similar acid-catalyzed reactions in liquid phase and not available in the most used mass-spectra libraries. © 2020

AB  - In this study, the use of low percentages of biodiesel blends from different feedstock's was investigated because it leads to little level performance decrease, with biodiesel advantages on reducing pollutant emissions according to ULSD when used in diesel engines only with a small amount of carbon residue in the combustion chamber. Therefore, firstly, biodiesel fuels were obtained from unique resources of animal, vegetable and microalgae oils by transesterification method. Then these biodiesel fuels were blended with ULSD by 10% and were named as here AOB10, VOB10 and MOB10, respectively. Afterword, these biodiesel blends were compared with ULSD by testing the combustion, performance and emission in a diesel engine generator under 3.52 kW, 6.98 kW and 10.37 kW loads with constant speed of 1500 rpm. According to the results, for all engine operating loads although the BSFC values of blends were higher compared to the ULSD, all blends gave almost identical results. In addition, blends had identical values of CGP, CHR, HRR, knock density and AGT compared to ULSD operation in engine. In the cases of usages of all blends; smoke opacity, HC and CO emissions considerably decreased, while NOx and CO2 slightly increased in all loads when compared to ULSD. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work presents an independent interconnected hybrid microgrid system that consists of sea wave generator, biodiesel generator, and battery energy storage system in microgrid 1 whereas, organic Rankine cycle based solar thermal power plant, biodiesel generator and superconducting magnetic energy storage in microgrid 2. DC link is used in both the microgrids to maintain faster sharing of power and address transient issues. A comparison of the system with and without DC link is done to establish its superiority. Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controllers are used for load frequency control of the system. The use of an algorithm to optimise the controller parameters is decided by a comparative analysis between Genetic algorithm (GA), Particle swarm optimization (PSO), sine-cosine algorithm (SCA), salp swarm algorithm (SSA) and Grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) which revealed the superiority of GOA over other algorithms. Different real-time scenarios are considered to study the frequency response of the system. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The National Policy on Biofuels (NPB) 2018 was adopted on May 16, 2018 in India to augment the generation of biofuels and to build a sustainable biofuel ecosystem. The Biodiesel Blending programme (BBP) got affected due to lack of sufficient feedstock coupled with an 18% Goods and Services Tax (GST) effective from July 1, 2017. The high GST resulted in the price of biodiesel being higher than that of conventional diesel thereby hindering the blending mandates. Most states in India do not allow free interstate movement of molasses resulting in artificially depressed prices besides derailing the Ethanol Blending Petrol (EBP) programme. NPB 2018 prohibits the import and export of biofuels to other nations resulting in reduced economic efficiency. The use of foodgrains as feedstock for biofuel production hampers food availability to the needy people and adversely affects food prices. The higher funding and incentives proposed to 2G ethanol production in NPB 2018 needs to be extended to 1G ethanol also as majority of the ethanol production happens through 1G. The paper touches upon the key biofuel policies of various nations, features of NPB 2018 and its critical analysis, BBP and EBP programmes and their current challenges and suggests future reforms. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of combined catalyst (ZSM-5 and CaO) for high quality bio-oil production from the catalytic pyrolysis of pinewood sawdust that was performed in Py-GC/MS and fixed bed reactor at 500 °C. In Py-GC/MS, the maximum yield of aromatic hydrocarbon was 36 wt% at biomass to combined catalyst ratio of 1:4 where the mass ratio of ZSM-5 to CaO in the combined catalyst was 4:1. An increasing trend of phenolic compounds was observed with an increasing amount of CaO, whereas the highest yield of phenolic compounds (31 wt%) was recorded at biomass to combined catalyst ratio of 1:4 (ZSM-5: CaO - 4:1). Large molecule compounds could be found to crack into small molecules over CaO and then undergo further reactions over zeolites. The water content, higher heating value, and acidity of bio-oil from the fixed bed reactor were 21%, 24.27 MJkg−1, and 4.1, respectively, which indicates that the quality of obtained bio-oil meets the liquid biofuel standard ASTM D7544-12 for grade G biofuel. This research will provide a significant reference to produce a high-quality bio-oil from the catalytic pyrolysis of woody biomass over the combined catalyst at different mass ratios of biomass to catalyst. © 2020 Energy Institute

AB  - The high tendency of bio-oil towards polymerization is one of the key challenges in hydrotreatment of bio-oil for production of bio-fuels. However, such properties of bio-oil could be used to produce carbon materials, but the mechanism for the polymerization has not been clarified. Bio-oil contains sugars, derivatives of sugars (i.e. furans et al.), phenolic monomers and oligomers. Among of them, the furans and phenolics are the typical compounds in bio-oil. In this study, the potential cross-polymerization between the furans (furan, furfural and furfuryl alcohol (FA)) and the phenolics (vanillin and guaiacol) in bio-oil was explored in water with/without H2SO4. The furans could polymerize via ring-opening to produce reactive reaction intermediates. Furfural and FA contained branched functionalities in furan ring, which was more reactive towards polymerization, especially for furfuryl alcohol. In general, the furans were more reactive towards polymerization than vanillin and guaiacol. Nevertheless, the cross-polymerization between the furans and phenolics occurred and significantly enhanced its tendency towards polymerization. The reaction intermediates formed via opening of the furan ring were the key initiator for the cross-polymerizations. Additionally, the presence of H2SO4 could enhance consumption of the C[dbnd]O during the polymerization and the thermal stability of the resulting polymer. © 2020

AB  - Nowadays, biodiesel has become a globally accepted renewable liquid fuel. The environmentally friendly enzymatic synthesis process is being widely researched. To solve the problem that production efficiency is low in enzymatic process, we optimized the structure of the static mixer by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling. The optimal static mixer consists of 6 mixer units, and the length-diameter ratio of every mixer unit is 1.5. The enzymatic synthesis of biodiesel was conducted between waste cooking oil (WCO) and methanol by transesterification and esterification. The reaction conditions were also optimized in this designed static-mixed reactor. Under optimal conditions, the reaction time can save half time when compared with the traditional stirred reactor, which indicates that the static mixer has higher production efficiency. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Producing renewable jet fuels from solid waste contributes greatly on circular economy with respect to the energy, environment and economics. The feedstock sources are resolved, the solid wastes are re-used, the pollution from aircrafts are reduced and the air energy is renewed. In this study, the rice husk biomass, which has been a headache agriculture waste in Taiwan, was turned into products similar to traditional jet fuel through fluidized bed fast pyrolysis, hydro-processing and hydro-cracking/isomerization, in which significant increases in normal alkanes, iso-alkanes and cycloalkanes were found. The final product from hydro-cracking/isomerization contained appropriate amount of normal, iso-, and cyclo-alkanes, which made it suitable to be the replacement for jet fuel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present work aims to utilise second-generation biofuel, namely jatropha oil (JO) and third-generation biofuel, namely waste tire pyrolysis oil (TPO) to replace diesel in a CI engine completely. However, fuel from a single source cannot fulfil the energy requirement. Hence, multiple sources of alternative fuels are necessary. JO has high viscosity, while TPO has low cetane number and high sulfur content. The merits and demerits of JO and TPO are mutually balanced, and the optimum blend matching the diesel performance will be identified. The engine used for this study is a single-cylinder CI engine producing 4.4 kW power at a constant speed of 1500 rpm. JO and TPO are blended in various proportions on a volume basis of 75% JO and 25% TPO (JO75 + TPO25), JO50 + TPO50 and JO25 + TPO75 and tested at different load conditions. Compared with diesel, JO exhibits poor combustion due to high viscosity leading to higher soot. Blending TPO with JO improves the performance and reduces soot considerably due to lower viscosity of TPO. With about 5% improvement in BTE and significant NO-soot tradeoff, JO50 + TPO50 is identified optimum to replace diesel in CI engine. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

In Ecuador, the net energy contribution of biofuels is unknown or unnoticed. To address this issue, we determined the Energy Return on Investment (EROI) for bioethanol and biodiesel. The selection of raw materials relied on their productive capacity, export and import records, and historical yields. Consequently, the scope included three raw materials for ethanol (sugar cane, corn, and forest residues) and four for biodiesel (African palm, pinion, bovine fat, and swine fat). Using a method based on the Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) of each biofuel, we assessed the entire production chain through statistical processing of primary and secondary information. Then we calculated the calorific values in the laboratory, compared energy inputs/outputs, and finally obtained the energetic returns. EROIs for bioethanol were: 1.797 for sugarcane, 1.040 for corn, and 0.739 for wood. The results for biodiesel were: 3.052 for African palm, 2.743 for pinion, 2.187 for bovine fat, and 2.891 for swine fat. These values suggest feasibility only for sugarcane in the case of ethanol. In contrast, biodiesel has better prospects because all the feedstocks analyzed had EROIs higher than two. Nevertheless, biodiesel is not available for trading in Ecuador because energy policy has overlooked systems based on higher energy return. Future studies should consider more comprehensive variables such as climate change, land use, and water management. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Different thermal stability of three major components is a challenge to efficiently liquefy lignocellulosic biomass into bio-oil because the degradation products from holocellulose can react with lignin, resulting in repolymerization reactions. In this work, a biorefinery approach of co-generation of bioethanol and bio-oil from rice straw that integrated separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) processes was proposed. SHF of dilute sulfuric acid pretreated rice straw gave a bioethanol concentration of 8.3 g/L with approximately 68% of theoretical yield. The maximum bio-oil yield 31.36 wt% via HTL of solid fermentation residues using bioethanol wastewater as the solvent was obtained under optimum conditions. Mass balance showed that 9.7 wt% bioethanol and 15.0 wt% bio-oil were produced corresponding to 56% energy recovery. Separate conversion of cellulose and lignin could be one promising way to enhance the overall energy recovery from lignocellulose to liquid biofuels. © 2020

AB  - The potential to increase biofuel output from a fast pyrolysis-based biorefinery through hydrogen enhancement is assessed for thermal fast pyrolysis (TFP) and catalytic pyrolysis (CAT) processes featuring bio-oil upgrade into gasoline, diesel and heavy hydrocarbon fractions. Results show that utilizing pyrolysis process off-gases to produce synthetic natural gas with an external hydrogen source could provide up to 48.2% (TFP) and 61.2% (CAT) reductions in biomass resource utilization. These savings are enabled by significantly improved carbon efficiency of the hydrogen enhanced designs, with efficiencies increasing from 40.5% to 66.3% for TFP and from 28.9% to 58.6% for CAT. Although the CAT process has a lower biofuel yield than the TFP process, it has a higher potential for hydrogen enhancement and achieves a higher biofuel output than TFP when fully enhanced with external hydrogen. The trade-off to the improved biofuel yield (higher carbon efficiency) is the substantial need for electricity to produce hydrogen via electrolysis, as for every megajoule (MJ) of biomass feedstock, 0.65–0.66 MJ of electricity is needed for the electrolyser. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recently, more attention has been paid to the application of biobutanol in spark ignition (SI) engines due to its superior properties among the biofuels. However, the high energy consumption and low efficiency of recovering biobutanol from ABE solution during the fermentation process lead to the high price of biobutanol, which limits its popularization in vehicles. Using ABE directly can solve the problem of high price of bio-butanol. This research explored the performance of an SI engine with ABE port injection (ABEPI) plus gasoline direct injection (GDI) at different excess air ratio (λ = 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2) and ABE port injection ratio (ABEPIr = 0, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%). The results show that CA10-90 declines with increasing ABEPIr. CA0-10 and CA0-90 decrease with ABEPIr increasing at λ = 0.9, and first descend and then rise at λ = 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2. The coefficient of variations of IMEP (CoVIMEP) reaches the minimum value at ABEPIr = 75%. As ABEPIr increases, the peak in-cylinder pressure (Pmax), indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) and brake thermal efficiency (BTE) increase at λ = 0.9 while first increase and then decrease at λ = 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2, reaching the maximum values at ABEPIr = 75%. Hydrocarbon (HC) reaches the minimum value at ABEPIr = 50%. Particle number decreases dramatically as ABEPIr increases from 0% to 50% and remains at an extremely low level when ABEPIr is greater than 50%. In summary, ABE is suitable for SI engine as an alternative fuel and fuels with high ABE ratio (≥50%) can effectively improve the combustion and particle emissions by ABEPI + GDI combined injection. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The utilization of biofuels in Low Temperature Combustion has shown great potential to decrease emissions and improve overall lifecycle energy efficiency. In particular, wet ethanol (a mixture of ethanol and water) as a domestically sourced biofuel has shown such potential. This study aims to determine what blend of wet ethanol would optimize combustion properties under HCCI operating conditions, both naturally aspirated and boosted. Four different blends are tested, and it is determined that WE80 (80% ethanol and 20% water by mass) exhibits optimal combustion characteristics when examining upstream intake temperature, combustion efficiency and thermal efficiency, regardless of intake boost level. This work then studies how the combustion process of wet ethanol is affected by the addition of the cetane improver di-tertiary-butyl peroxide (DTBP). It was found that DTBP did not elicit any cool flame reactions from the ethanol, which is a single stage ignition fuel, regardless of boost level. DTBP was able to lower the required intake temperature of wet ethanol without significantly affecting the combustion process, i.e. no changes in burn duration or combustion efficiency. It is found that WE80 with 5% DTBP at 1.8 bar intake pressure required an intake temperature of ~320 K. While there is some disagreement about whether the effects of cetane improvers can be attributed to thermal or chemical causes, this study suggests that the effects are more likely attributable to chemical kinetics. DTBP is also shown to apparently increase wet ethanol's equivalence ratio sensitivity slightly, which could have implications for other advanced combustion modes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In biodiesel, long chain methyl esters crystallize at very low temperatures, forming paraffin crystals that clump together and clog fuel filters, preventing engine operation. When the fuel is at high temperatures and in the presence of oxygen from the air, chemical changes may occur, forming insoluble compounds in the fuel itself. This work followed the evolution of deposits and enhancers formation in biodiesel samples and their mixtures with diesel. Thus, samples of pure biodiesel mixed with diesel were stored under two temperature conditions, 30 °C and 4 °C–10 °C, for a period of 12 months. The results indicate that the residue formation in soybean biodiesel was intensified by the low temperature, time and presence of dissolved water, being the monoglycerides the main inducers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel was directly one-step produced from waste oils without pretreatment catalyzed by a solid base alkalized from spent bleaching clay (SBC) ash. Optimized conditions were obtained with 99.1% biodiesel yield from soybean oil with an orthogonal design. The base catalyst was stable within 8 cycles (&gt;95% biodiesel yield) and resistant to saponification (AV = 9.7 mg KOH/g, 96.5% biodiesel yield). The base was characterized with XRD, EDX-mapping, FT-IR, XRF and TPD, and it had similar strong basicity to Na2SiO3 (0.21 vs. 0.22 mmol/g for Na2SiO3) with active sites of Na2O and CH3ONa evolved from Na2SiO3 and NaAlSiO4 by reactions of NaOH with oxides (e.g., SiO2, Al2O3) in SBC ash. Furthermore, the base was magnetized with magnetism of 6.86 emu/g by carbonizing residual oil in SBC as carbon support and reductant (of Fe2O3 to magnetic Fe3O4 particles). It catalyzed soybean oil to produce biodiesel with 99.2% yield and blended oil (AV = 5.9) to biodiesel with 91.9% yield without any saponification. The catalyst was magnetically separated and reused for 3 cycles with 87% yield. The non-magnetic base could also efficiently catalyze actual SBC oil for the production of biodiesel with 95% yield at AV of 10. This work realized the full use of inorganics in SBC, and its oil for direct biodiesel production at a low temperature (i.e., 65 vs. 120 °C with sulfuric acid process) without wastes produced and results can easily find practical applications for waste oils. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To meet the demands for resources, food and energy, especially in fast developing countries in the Global South, new infrastructure investments, technologies and supply chains are required. It is essential to manage a transition that minimises the impacts on global environmental degradation while benefits local socio-economic development. Food-bioenergy integration optimising natural capital resources and considering wider environmental and socio-economic sustainability offers a way forward. This study presents an integrative approach enabling whole systems modelling to address the interlinkage and interaction of resource-food-bioenergy systems and optimise supply chains considering poly-centric decision spaces. Life cycle sustainability assessment, optimisation, agent-based modelling and simulation were coupled to build an integrated systems modelling framework applicable to the resource-food-bioenergy nexus. The model building blocks are described before their applications in three case studies addressing agricultural residues and macro-fungi in the Philippines, sugar cane biorefineries in South Africa, and Nipa palm biofuel in Thailand. Our case studies revealed the great potential of untapped biomass including agricultural waste and non-food biomass grown on marginal lands. Two value chain integration case studies – i.e. straw-fungi-energy in Philippines and sugar-energy in Africa – have been suggested as sustainable solutions to recover waste as value-added products to meet food and energy security. Case studies highlight how an integrative modelling framework can be applied to address multi-level questions, taking into account decision-making at different levels, which contribute to an overall sustainability goal. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Dangerous environmental consequences and market unpredictability of fossil fuels have necessitated the need for sustainable large-scale production of biofuel in Nigeria. Unrefined palm oil (UPO) is a significant product of commercially available oil palm plants in the country. This study experimentally investigates the production of biodiesel from refined, bleached and deodorised (RBD) palm olein extracted from UPO obtained from batch reactors. The transesterification process of the RBD palm olein with methanol and in the presence of potassium hydroxide (KOH) catalyst produced biodiesel with a 62.5% yield, thus confirming its feasibility for mass production. The derived biodiesel has properties equivalent to ASTM D792 standard for biodiesel fuels. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Bifunctional CumNin/CoOx catalysts were fabricated by co-precipitation method and applied in in-situ hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of biomass derived oleic acid to n-heptadecane with isopropanol as hydrogen source. Upon incorporating Cu or Ni into CoOx, the catalytic performance could be easily boosted. By varying Cu/Ni ratio, reduction temperature as well as catalyst loading, the optimized Cu1Ni1/CoOx exhibited &gt;99% conversion and 91.3% n-heptadecane yield at 240 °C in 8 h. Characterizations showed that synergistic effect between Cu, Ni and CoOx was existed, thus strengthening H2 production ability towards isopropanol and favoring the generation of n-heptadecane. Kinetic studies revealed HDO of oleic acid to alkane mainly proceeded via decarbonylation of stearaldehyde rather than direct decarboxylation of stearic acid, and the rate determining step relied on octadecanol dehydrogenation. This catalyst could be magnetically separated for 5 times recycling and was versatile for in situ HDO of various fatty acids, thus achieving a low-cost, energy-saving biomass-to-biofuel conversion. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

However, optimal algae growth rates have gained if the algal growth media temperature located between 25 and 30 °C, for most of the kind of the algae. However, there is no available data in the previous literature concerning the environmental conditions, such as the sunshine intensity and the air temperature during the day, and its effect on the cultivation media temperature. In the present study, the continuous photobioreactor has been designed to obtain biomass and Esterified fatty acids (EFA) from the green algal. Therefore, the Optimum pH and Na2CO3 concentrations are 7.5 and 5 g, respectively. While the optimum productivity of S. Obliquus algae can be reached to 1.12 (gm. L-1 Day-1) and EFA yield is 377.6 (gm. L-1 Day-1) by optimization the cultivations conditions. Also, the solar thermal radiation effect on the cultivation medium temperatures has investigated. Those have been achieved using mechanical flipping for the cultivation medium and applying a new Air-Bubble-Generation (ABG) system. The used technique in the current study can enhance the sunlight heat and temperature stability of the cultivation media within the optimum range despite the variation on the ambient air temperature. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work establishes a ranking of the potential oleaginous feedstocks for HEFA biojet production in southeast Brazil, and consolidates their advantages and limitations, in order to assist in prioritizing strategic actions, such as research, R&D investment, and incentives for the most promising regional oilseeds. The oilseeds and the criteria considered were determined from a bibliographical review, using two multi-criteria tools in the evaluation: the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The economic criterion and the oil cost sub-criterion were considered the determining factors for the choice of oilseeds, which obtained the following ranking: soybean, jatropha, sunflower, castor bean, macauba palm, cotton, and peanut. Soybean ranked first mainly because of the lower cost of its oil and high agricultural maturity. Hence, soybean should be used first in HEFA biojet production. However, considering that soybean oil is the main feedstock for biodiesel production in the country, it is also important to evaluate other potential crops. Thus, stimulating research aimed at reaching the technological domain of new local oleaginous plants is essential to increase the scale of production, reduce oil costs, and make HEFA production more competitive and sustainable. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The Fischer-Tropsch process is less complex and more environmentally friendly alternative to petroleum-based fuels. With growing interest in biomass-to-fuel conversion like the production of bioethanol, there is a steady supply of unfermentable biomass from bioethanol industries, which can be gasified and converted to Fischer-Tropsch syncrude. In this work, the economic and ecological feasibility of integrating a Fischer-Tropsch process using syngas obtained from the gasification of dry distillers’ grain is explored. Data from a lab-scale experiment using pelletized promoted iron supported on Carbon Nano Tubes (Fe/CNT) is used to simulate a plant for the production of 1000 kg of syncrude/h. The techno-economic feasibility of setting up a Fischer-Tropsch process is explored based on chemical engineering plant cost index of 628.2. An internal rate of return of 107.9% was obtained with a net annual profit of 5.2 MUSD/year which is higher than those reported for other Fischer-Tropsch plants due to the readily availability of the feedstock without any associated transportation costs. The potential environmental impact of the Fischer-Tropsch fuels was evaluated by the WAste Reduction (WAR) algorithm and suggested that the integration of the Fischer-Tropsch process into the bio-ethanol production plant is environmentally benign. © 2020

AB  - Optimization of fuel injection strategies can maximize the utilization of biodiesel by addressing the issues concern with fuel consumption, engine performance, and exhaust gas emission. In the midst of the pervasiveness of plant-based biofuel, this paper focused on maximizing the pine oil biodiesel usage in a diesel engine having common rail direct injection (CRDI) system without any engine modifications. Pine oil derived from pine tree resins, has shown impressive fuel properties such as lower viscosity, flash point, boiling point and comparable calorific value to diesel. In this study, the impact of high fuel injection pressure on the engine characteristics of a diesel engine fueled by 30% pine oil biodiesel blend (P30) was analyzed. At standard 200 bar fuel injection pressure, the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) of P30 biodiesel blend was decreased compared to sole diesel. To improve the utilization and performance of the P30 blend, fuel injection pressure increased from 200 bar to 350 bar at a step of 50 bar. The results show that BTE and combustion characteristics are improved with an increase in injection pressure. The P30 fuel exhibits maximum BTE of 26.1% at 350 bar which is 6.9% higher the BTE of diesel at 200 bar. Exhaust emissions (CO, HC & Smoke) decreased gradually with increase in fuel injection pressure due to high atomization of fuel, faster evaporation, and formation of the better air fuel mixture. At 100% load condition, the P30 blend shows a maximum decrease in CO and HC emission at 300 bar, which is 16.6% and 13.1% less respectively compared to sole diesel at 200 bar injection pressure. The NOx is increased by about 9.4% for P30 blend at 350 bar when compared to that of Diesel at 200 bar. Thus, the blending ratio of pine oil biodiesel in the diesel can be extended by increasing the fuel injection pressure. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Catalytic hydropyrolysis of biomass to green fuels was performed using supported, sulfided CoMo catalysts. With MgAl2O4 as support material the CoMo loading was varied between 4.1 and 12.0 wt% at constant Co/Mo atomic ratio of 0.3. Increasing the metal loading decreased the amount of oxygen in the condensed organic phase from 9.0 to 4.7 wt% on dry basis (db) and the condensable organic yield decreased from 25.2 to 22.7 wt% on dry ash free (daf) basis, corresponding to a decrease in the carbon recovery from 39 to 37%. Using zeolite H-ZSM-5 mixed with alumina as support with a CoMo loading of 4.1 wt%, the condensed organics contained only 5.2 to 6.1 wt% db oxygen. The condensable organic yield was between 23.9 and 24.4 wt% db, and the carbon recovery was 39–40%. Thus using an acidic support can remove the oxygen without decreasing the carbon recovery. The latter was ascribed to alkylation of the aromatics when the zeolite support was used. Elemental maps of the spent catalysts were obtained using STEM-EDS, showing that the CoMo phase was mainly located as monolayer MoS2 slab structures (&gt;93%) on the support and indicated a high dispersion of cobalt, consistent with incorporation of Co into the MoS2 structure in the CoMoS phase. Potassium was observed on all the spent catalysts, indicating transfer of alkali metal from the biomass to the catalyst. Potassium may decrease the acidity of the catalyst over time, thus reducing the positive effect of using a more acidic support. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Although many studies have concerned effect of different kind of biodiesel fuel on engine, there are no information about the comparison between different biodiesels in a comprehensive study and with consideration of pilot injection and EGR system. Therefore, the aim of this study is to have a comprehensive investigation of the effect of pilot injection timing and EGR system, as common ways to reduce engine emissions, on engine combustion, emissions and performance while using of different kind of the biodiesel. The brassica, cardoon, coffee, waste cooking oil biodiesels and standard diesel fuels were evaluated fuels. However, the results of the study depicted that different characteristics of the considered fuels had changed the engine response to variation of injection strategy and EGR application. The maximum reduction of combustion duration compare to diesel fuel (17.7%) was related to coffee biodiesel. Moreover, Coffee biodiesel has lowest pressure rise rate. On the other hand, cardoon had shortest ignition delay and highest combustion temperature. In addition, maximum retardation of combustion position was for brassica biodiesel fuel (19.07%). Although the NOx emission has decreased due to application of EGR (up to 86%) and pilot injection (up to 29.3%), high EGR rate in high IMEP has changed the combustion quality due to sewer changes in the combustion quality. In this condition, CO and THC emission increased severely. Higher viscosity and lower oxygen content of the coffee and cardoon biodiesel than diesel fuel decreased combustion quality and caused the higher THC, CO and soot emissions and lower NOx emissions than brassica and WCO biodiesel fuels in higher EGR rates and IMEPs. It can be stated that pilot injection and EGR are two parameters which are effective significantly on the engine characteristics and the adjusting of these parameters should be done properly specially according to the used fuel properties. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study we investigated the potential use of coffee waste feedstock in biodiesel production, considering economic viability, technical feasibility, and environmental compatibility. The investment potential for a small-scale biodiesel production facility (8000 t/y) was gauged by estimating relevant economic performance indicators. Biodiesel was then extracted from spent coffee grounds and blended with fossil diesel to develop four blends: B5, B10, B15, and B20. The conformity of this fuel with relevant standards (ASTM D6751 and ISO EN14214) was determined by characterizing and adjusting the fuel's properties during the production process. The technical and environmental performance of these blends was then tested in a single-cylinder compression ignition engine with an extended range of engine speeds under three engine loading conditions (100%, 75%, and 50%), using pure diesel fuel for benchmark comparisons. The evaluated economic metrics paint an optimistic picture of investment in this project. Waste coffee could result in improved economic performance over other feedstocks. Diesel fuel outperformed the biodiesel blends in terms of engine power, thermal efficiency, and fuel economy, whereas the blends were superior in terms of exhaust gas temperature; average exhaust gas temperature drops of 11 °C and 35.2 °C were measured under full load conditions for B5 and B20, respectively. All blends emitted lower levels of CO2, CO, and HC than did diesel, but higher NOx emissions were present, all proportional to the blend used. Our results clearly show that SCG has great potential as a feedstock for biodiesel production, given its derivation from existing waste materials, cleaner but comparable performance, and economically viable production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study dwells the assessment of vibration and noise levels with the use of biodiesel and hydrogen in dual fuel mode in a single-cylinder, 4-stroke CI engine at different compression ratios (16, 17.5, and 18.5). Niger seed oil methyl ester (NSOME) blends B10, B20, and B40 were used as test fuels and conducted the experimental test at full load (12 kgf) by maintaining the constant engine speed of 1500 rpm. Further, the blend B20 was enriched with different hydrogen flow rates of 5 lpm, 10 lpm, and 15 lpm. The vibration (velocity) and noise levels were measured at the engine body and estimated in terms of RMS values for different test fuels. The vibration levels were decreased when operated with NSOME blends, and B20 has shown fewer vibrations at all the compression ratios compared to other test fuels used. Similarly, the noise levels of NSOME blends were observed to be lower than diesel fuel. Further, the vibration and noise levels of B20 were decreased at higher flow rates of hydrogen. For all the test fuels used, the increasing trend of vibrations was observed at higher compression ratios. © 2019, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - Microalgae have great potential as an energy and feed resource. Here we evaluate the water use associated with freshwater algae cultivation and find it is possible to scale U.S. algae biofuel production to 20.8 billion liters of renewable diesel annually without significant water-stress impact. Among potential sites, water-stress is significantly more variable than algae productivity across location and season. Thus, it is possible to reduce water-stress impact, quantified as water scarcity footprint, through the choice of algae site location. We test three site-selection criteria based on (1) biomass productivity, (2) water-use efficiency, and (3) water-stress impact and find that adding water-stress constraints to productivity-based ranking of suitable sites reduces water-stress impact by 97% and water consumption by half, compared with biomass-productivity ranking alone, with little productivity impact (<1.7% per-site on average). With 20.8 billion liters, algae could meet 19.7% of U.S. jet fuel demand with a freshwater demand of less than 1.4% of U.S. irrigation consumption. Evaluating water-stress impact is important because the impact of unit water consumption on water stress varies significantly across regions and seasons. Considering seasonal water balances allows producers to understand the combined seasonal effects of hydrologic flows and productivity, thereby avoiding potential short-term water stress. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The Turpentine oil has getting wider attention in recent times due to many significant benefits. In this present study, 20% Turpentine oil has been blended with 80% diesel fuel by volume. A novel cetane improver called SC5D has been doped with 20% biofuel at 2.5% and 5% concentrations. All the properties of all the blends are evaluated and it has been identified that the 5% of cetane improver has increases the fuel density. All the fuel samples have been tested in a single cylinder CRDI diesel engine under different pilot injection rate of 15% and 30% at 600 bar injection pressure. For the higher NOx emission condition, the 10% EGR has also been applied. The experimental study revealed that the addition of cetane improver with biofuel blends has shown comparable performance behaviours at all concentrations. Furthermore, the unburned hydrocarbon and smoke emissions are remarkably lower for biofuel blends at both the injection rate with cetane improver addition. Significant reductions has been noticed by 10% EGR addition for PI15% rate at 2.5% and 5% concentrations without much defect in other emissions. All the combustion behaviours have shown comparable behaviours with cetane improver addition and 10% EGR implementation with biofuel blends. Therefore, it can be concluded that the novel cetane improver could be used as additive with Turpentine oil in diesel engine applications. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, a biodiesel was produced from blending vegetable and animal sources with diesel and diesel-ethanol using a motor-generator set to evaluate its performance and emission characteristics. Fifteen and twenty percent of animal-vegetable biodiesel were added to each diesel-ethanol blend. A motor-generator test was conducted for each mixture; each sample was subjected to resistive loads from 2 to 5 kW with six repetitions. The physicochemical properties met the national standard guidelines, while the best specific fuel consumption (SFC) was observed for the 15% biodiesel-1% ethanol (B15E1) blend at the load of 5 kW with 327.069 g kW−1 h−1, followed by diesel (334.875 g kW−1 h−1). The exhaust gas temperature behaved differently depending on the ethanol concentration; it was lower when the concentration of added ethanol was higher. The NO emissions decreased while the SO2 emissions increased as the ethanol concentration increased. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In present work, Jatropha, Karanja (non-edible) and Cottonseed (edible) oils were mixed in the selected proportions and then converted to biomix methyl ester through transesterification process. Experiments were performed on a single cylinder non-road diesel engine with biomix methyl ester and results were compared with neat diesel, Jatropha, Karanja and Cottonseed biodiesel's. The major limitation observed in the biodiesel research is the fuel composition variability raised due to feedstock quality and production process parameters. Hence to have a sustainable biodiesel production based on available feedstocks of the region with balanced proportion of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, use of biomix fuel is proposed on non-road diesel engine in this study. Non-road diesel engines are widely used in agriculture, power generation and construction equipment's which is also consuming lot of diesel and emitting more emissions. Use of renewable biomix fuel on non-road diesel engines will cut carbon foot print on the environment and it is better than biodiesel derived from a single feedstock based on the composition, fuel properties, performance and emissions. The results also indicated that biomix fuel has higher brake thermal efficiency, lower oxides of nitrogen and carbon-di-oxide emissions compared to biodiesel derived from single feedstock. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the toxicological impacts of exhaust generated during the combustion process of aviation fuel containing synthesized hydrocarbons. Design/methodology/approach: Tests on aircraft turbine engines in full scale are complex and expensive. Therefore, a miniature turbojet engine was used in this paper as a source of exhaust gases. Toxicity was tested using innovative BAT–CELL Bio–Ambient Cell method, which consists of determination of real toxic impact of the exhaust gases on the human lung A549 and mouse L929 cells. The research was of a comparative nature. The engine was powered by a conventional jet fuel and a blend of conventional jet fuel with synthesized hydrocarbons. Findings: The results show that the BAT–CELL method allows determination of the real exhaust toxicity during the combustion process in a turbine engine. The addition of a synthetic component to conventional jet fuel affected the reduction of toxicity of exhaust gases. It was confirmed for both tested cell lines. Originality/value: In the literature related to the area of aviation, numerous publications in the field of testing the emission of exhaust gaseous components, particulates or volatile organic compounds can be found. However, there is a lack of research related to the evaluation of the real exhaust toxicity. In addition, it appears that the data given in aviation sector, mainly related to the emission levels of gaseous exhaust components (CO, Nox and HC) and particulate matters, might be insufficient. To fully describe the engine exhaust emissions, they should be supplemented with additional tests, i.e. in terms of toxicity. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Alternative fuels are the need of time because of finite fossil fuels. Biodiesel produced by enzyme-catalyzed transesterification is an environment-friendly and greener alternative fuel. However, the main shortcoming of biodiesel production is high cost of production. Successful recovery for high cost of production is the use of waste cooking oils. In this study, lipase from porcine pancreas was immobilized on genipin cross-linked chitosan for catalyzing the transesterification of waste cooking oil to produce biodiesel in presence and absence of solvents. Solvents in a reaction mixture keep the essential water layer around lipase intact, which protects lipase from methanol inactivation. Our result showed no significant effect of solvent on transesterification reaction, suggesting the resistant nature of lipase against methanol. This bypasses the need to recover the solvent, making the process more economical. The structural morphology of genipin cross-linked chitosan beads was studied by SEM. The conversion of waste cooking oils into Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) was analyzed by Gas Chromatography. Under the optimized conditions of 9:1 methanol/oil molar ratio, water content 6% (w/w) enzyme, at 40ºC, 10-hr reaction time, 7.5 wt% catalyst loading at 150 rpm, the ester yield was found to be 92.33%, with good reusability in solvent-free system. The obtained biodiesel was characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and FTIR spectroscopy. The biodiesel synthesis in solvent-free system described in the study is a prospective economical method for the synthesis of the biodiesel with more than 90% yield and good reusability. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The aim of this work is to analyze the effect of using diethyl ether (DEE) as an oxygenated additive of straight vegetable oils (SVOs) in triple blends with fossil diesel, to be used in current compression ignition (C.I.) engines, in order to implement the current process of replacing fossil fuels with others of a renewable nature. The use of DEE is considered taking into account the favorable properties for blending with SVO and fossil diesel, such as its very low kinematic viscosity, high oxygen content, low autoignition temperature, broad flammability limits (it works as a cold start aid for engines), and very low values of cloud and pour point. Therefore, DEE can be used as a solvent of vegetable oils to reduce the viscosity of the blends and to improve cold flow properties. Besides, DEE is considered renewable, since it can be easily obtained from bioethanol, which is produced from biomass through a dehydration process. The vegetable oils evaluated in the mixtures with DEE were castor oil, which is inedible, and sunflower oil, used as a standard reference for waste cooking oil. In order to meet European petrodiesel standard EN 590, a study of the more relevant rheological properties of biofuels obtained from the DEE/vegetable oil double blends has been performed. The incorporation of fossil diesel to these double blends gives rise to diesel/DEE/vegetable oil triple blends, which exhibited suitable rheological properties to be able to operate in conventional diesel engines. These blends have been tested in a conventional diesel engine, operating as an electricity generator. The efficiency, consumption and smoke emissions in the engine have been measured. The results reveal that a substitution of fossil diesel up to 40% by volume can be achieved, independently of the SVO employed. Moreover, a significant reduction in the emission levels of pollutants and better cold flow properties has been also obtained with all blends tested. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Biodiesel is a mixture of fatty acids methyl esters derived from the triglyceride of vegetable oil. Vegetable oils consist of different types of fatty acids which influence the biodiesel fuel properties, combustion, and emissions, especially oxides of nitrogen emission. Nitric oxides emissions are one of the major threats posed by biodiesel fuel due to the presence of unsaturated fatty acids (C=C double bonds). An attempt has been made to control these nitric oxides emission through reformulated biodiesel fuel approach. In this study, reformulated biodiesel fuel was prepared by blending individual biodiesels, based on their fatty acid composition percentage (v/v %). Two samples, RBF-I and RBF-II, were prepared and tested in a single-cylinder compression ignition engine. Reformulated biodiesel fuel results in increased saturated fatty acids, long-chain saturation factor, and cetane number and a decrease in the degree of unsaturation, viscosity, density, higher heating value, and iodine value compared to individual biodiesel. RBF fuel sample showed higher cylinder pressure and the advanced start of combustion compared to diesel fuel. RBF samples shows a 20% lower nitric oxides emission and 30% higher smoke emissions than diesel fuel. Carbon monoxide emission of RBF increased as compared to diesel fuel, whereas carbon dioxide emissions were lowered by 35% approximately. Hydrocarbon emissions were found to be lower for RBF-I, but it was higher for RBF-II throughout the engine test load conditions. It is inferred that reformulated biodiesel is a potential fuel formulation technique in solving challenges associated with biodiesel as fuel in diesel engines. © 2019, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - Due to the toxicity and low biodegradability, mineral lubricants have been sharing space with green lubricants. Moringa oleifera can grow naturally in dry regions with subtropical climates and the oil, rich in unsaturated compounds (79.87 %), may be a potential feedstock for fuel and lubricant base stocks. Moringa oil was hydrolyzed and then esterified with polyols, trimethylolpropane (MTMPE) and pentaerythritol (MPEE), in the temperature range of 130–140 °C. P-toluene sulfonic acid (p-TSA) was used as the catalyst. The products obtained were characterized using 1H and 13C NMR, IR, and mass spectral techniques. The main physicochemical properties, the thermal behavior and toxicity against Artemia salina of products were evaluated. In addition, blends with the naphthenic lubricant, NH10, were prepared with 20 %, 35 %, and 50 % of the moringa esters. The synthesized samples have high viscosity indices (VI = 170) and they were found to be non-toxic against A. salina (LC50&gt;1000 ppm). MTMPE presented higher thermal stability and showed a melting point of -38.5 °C, which reveals its potential for applications in very low temperatures. Blends showed high viscosity indices and reduced toxicity compared to pure NH10. The study revealed that moringa esters are interesting to be applied as environmental friendly lubricants or additives. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The purification of second-generation biofuels is becoming an urgent issue due to the toxicity of the combustion products of residual phenol in these biofuels. The use of solid sorbents such as zeolites appears as a promising solution for ensuring the selective sorption of phenol towards aromatics (the main components of biofuel). In the present work, we have adopted a bottom-up approach for removing phenol from a synthetic biofuel feed containing isooctane, phenol (1 wt.%), n-nonane (1 wt.%) and toluene (40 wt.%), using faujasite-type Y zeolites with Si/Al ratio = 2.5. The astonishing performance of HY zeolite to treat the synthetic biofuel has been highlighted by assessing the interaction modes of the molecules involved over the structural sites via the combination of theoretical molecular modeling and experimental adsorption experiments. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Novel Brønsted acid functionalized phthalocyanine on perylene diimide framework knotted with ionic liquid (BAFPcPDIL) was synthesized and confirmed by instrumentation techniques. DRS-spectrum and Hammett value has been determined to confirm band-gap and proton levels of photo-catalyst respectively. The photo-catalytic performance was evaluated by production of octyl levulinate (OL) using levulinic acid (LA) with n-octyl alcohol (OA) under visible light irradiations. Response surface methodology (RSM) with Box–Behnken design (BBD) with 29 experiments was applied to explore consequences of four crucial process variables: catalyst loading (A), molar ratio of reactants (B) and power of visible light (C), duration in hour (D) on OL yield. From the model, the optimum conditions for the utmost conversion were found as: 10 mg catalyst with (1:1) alcohol to LA molar ratio under 12 W lamp, in 12 h for completing esterification reaction with 95.58% yield of OL. With optimum conditions, various alkyl esters such as methyl levulinate 92.14%, ethyl levulinate 93.12%, n-propyl levulinate 91.45%, iso-propyl levulinate 92.38%, n-butyl levulinate 85.13%, n-pentyl levulinate 86.35%, n-hexyl levulinate 89.57%, tert-butyl levulinate 91.58%, were successfully synthesized with excellent yields. The plausible photocatalytic mechanism of the esterification reaction was also described. The study was extended on blending of OL with diesel sample in 10–30%, found comparable result of density, kinematic viscosity, calorific values, cetane number, flash, fire and pour point of the blended samples with blank diesel sample and appreciable changes in exhaust gases of 25% blended diesel sample. Additionally, BAFPcPDIL displayed good recyclability without loss of photo reactivity after four runs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Potato peel waste (PPW) is a carbohydrate-rich waste from potato industries, which is an environmental threat worldwide. In this study, it was evaluated for biobutanol production via acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation by Clostridium acetobutylicum. The results showed that PPW contained a considerable amount of glycoalkaloids, severe inhibitors for the bacterium. Thus, three processes, i.e., dilute acid pretreatment (Process I), the inhibitors extraction followed by dilute acid hydrolysis (Process II) and ethanol organosolv pretreatment (Process III), were employed before hydrolysis and fermentation to produce ABE. The extraction of glycoalkaloids with ethanol, dilute acid hydrolysis at 180 °C for 60 min, and enzymatic hydrolysis led to a hydrolysate with 36 g/L glucose, which was successfully fermented to 11.6 g/L ABE. In process II, the organosolv pretreatment led to the removal of the major fraction of inhibitors, in the range of 77–88% of glycoalkaloids. The enzymatic hydrolysis of PPW pretreated with 75% ethanol at 180 °C for 60 min resulted in a fermentable hydrolysate with 38 g/L glucose. The fermentation of overall hydrolysate resulted in a high ABE concentration of 24.8 g/L, indicating that PPW is an appropriate substrate for butanol production after the removal of its bacterial inhibitors. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The coupling of biological and thermal technologies allows for the complete conversion of wastes into energy and biochar eliminating the problem of sludge disposal. The valorisation of fatty residues as co-substrate in a mesophilic digester of a wastewater treatment plant was studied considering an integrated approach of co-digestion and pyrolysis. Four digested samples obtained from co-digestion of sewage sludge and butcher’s fat waste were studied by thermogravimetric analysis. The activation energy corresponding to the sludge pyrolysis was calculated by a non-isothermal kinetic. Arrhenius activation energy was lower for the pyrolysis of a digested grease sample (92 kJ mol−1 obtained by OFW and 86 kJ mol−1 obtained by Vyazovkin) than for the pyrolysis of sewage sludge and its blends (164–190 kJ mol−1 obtained by OFW and 162–190 kJ mol−1 obtained by Vyazovkin). The analysis of the integrated approach of anaerobic co-digestion and pyrolysis of digestates demonstrated that the addition of 3% (w/v) of fat to the feeding sludge results in a 25% increase in the electricity obtained from biogas (if a combined heat and power unit is considered for biogas valorisation) and increasing the fat content to 15% allows for covering all thermal needs for drying of digestate and more than doubles (2.4 times) the electricity production when the scenario of digestion and pyrolysis is contemplated. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Application of wastewater for algal biomass production can not only lead to production of thousands of tons of biomass for subsequent biofuel production, but also can provide for significant removal of contaminants in wastewater. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the growth, contaminant removal, and biochemical component (lipid, carbohydrate, and protein) accumulation potential of Chlorella vulgaris, Scenedesmus obliquus, and Oocystis minuta cells in wastewater supplemented with different concentrations of sulfate, nitrate, and phosphate. The results show maximum biomass productivity of 33, 19, and 98 mg dw/L/d for C. vulgaris, S. obliquus, and O. minuta, respectively. Phosphate removal (more than 90%) was highest in the culture with O. minuta; about 93% nitrate was removed by C. vulgaris, and the highest sulfate removal of 36% was observed in the culture with S. obliquus. The biochemical composition of the microalgae cells is in the ranges of 22–65% carbohydrate, 19–38% protein, and 8–17% lipid. This indicates that carbohydrate and protein are preferentially accumulated as compared to lipids under the growth conditions investigated for each of the microalgae strains. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - High environmental pollutants and depleted fossil fuels forced researchers to investigating renewable and low emission fuels. In this study, renewable bioethanol and bio-acetone are mixed together and examined as a new fuel for SI engine for the first time. Three different blend rates are applied (3, 7, and 10 vol% of dual bio-acetone and bioethanol in gasoline) and compared with each other and the pure gasoline. Results of engine performance and pollutant emissions of different blends confirmed that the utmost blend rate (10 vol% of bioethanol and bio-acetone in gasoline) introduced the greatest volumetric efficiency, brake power, and output torque and the lowest CO and UHC emissions, compared to other fuel blends and pure gasoline. Besides, all fuel blends showed higher performance and lower emissions than the pure gasoline. The ternary blended fuels (bioethanol-bio-acetone-gasoline, ACE) are also compared with dual ones (bioethanol-gasoline blends, E, and bio-acetone-gasoline blends, AC), for the first time in the literature. Results showed that the lowest emissions (CO, CO2, and UHC) are introduced by ACE blends, while the best performance (volumetric efficiency and engine power) is partly introduced by E blends. The ACE shared also the best performance (output torque) from the SI engine. The AC blends, however, introduced a moderate performance and emissions among all biofuel blends (ACE and E). The E blends, on the other hand, introduced the highest green unsuitability emissions, even higher than the pure gasoline. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The experimental investigation has been carried out on the diesel engine using Chlorella vulgaris algal biodiesel as blends with neat diesel. Two input parameters, such as load and fuel and four reaction parameters such as hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and smoke, were used for the emissions on the engine. The experimental results show that there's been less pollution from using algae oil blend in the diesel engine. It is employed to find the optimum level for multi-objective prediction carried out for CO, HC, NOx, and smoke. The outcomes after grey relational analysis (GRA) were tested using the response surface methodology (RSM), wherein the optimal combination has been found out using a particular behaviour. © 2020 Polish Forest Society.

AB  - The creep trend method is used for the analysis of the development of electric car production in three regions: The United States, the European Union and Japan. Based on vehicle registration and population growth data for each year the creep trend method using historical data for the years 2007–2017 is applied for forecasting development up to 2030. Moreover, the original method for calculating the primary energy factor (PEF) was applied to the analysis of power engineering systems in the regions investigated. The assessment of the effects of electromobility development on air quality has been performed, reduction values for pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions have been determined, which was the main objective of this manuscript. Mitigation of air pollutant emissions, i.e., carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) was estimated and compared to the eventual expected increase of emissions from power plants due to an increase of the demand for electricity. It can be concluded that electricity powered cars along with appropriate choices of energetic resources as well as electricity distribution management will play the important role to achieve the sustainable energy economy. Based on the emission reduction projections resulting from the projected increase in the number of electric cars, (corrected) emissions will be avoided in 2030 in the amount of over 14,908,000 thousand tonnes CO2 in European Union, 3,786,000 thousand tonnes CO2 in United States and 111,683 thousand tonnes CO2 in Japan. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - This research aims to investigate the role of silica as a support for CaO catalyst in 4 different aspects: determination of optimum parameters, tolerance of water and FFA content, leaching and kinetics evaluation, and reusability of catalyst. Silica was extracted from rice husk by ion exchange method and subsequently impregnated with CaO. The experimental results showed that the supported catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic activity in transesterification of waste cooking oil with high yield of biodiesel, comparable to that of CaO catalyst. This is due to the fact that catalyst with higher surface area produces higher biodiesel yield. The presence of water did not have significant effect on the performance of supported catalysts, as silica can act as catalyst to esterify the FFA. Furthermore, silica support offered the greatest extent of leaching minimization of CaO and it has been proved that the calcium leached species was insignificant in transesterification reaction. Reusability study suggests that the synthesized catalysts can be recycled up for 8 successive runs. In conclusion, employing calcium rich wastes derived CaO impregnated with silica as catalyst showed good potential in catalytic applications with high economic benefits. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Catalytic cracking of vegetable oil mainly processed over zeolites, and among all the zeolites particularly HZMS-5 has been investigated on wide range for renewable and clean gasoline production from various plant oils. Despite the fact that HZSM-5 offers a higher conversion degree and boost aromatics yield, the isomerate yield reduces due to high cracking activity and shape selectivity of HZSM-5. Hence, to overcome these problems, in this study the transition metals, such as nickel and copper doped over HZSM-5 were tested for its efficiencies to improve the isoparaffin compounds. The catalysts were screened with linoleic acid in a catalytic cracking reaction conducted at 450 ᵒC for 90 min in an atmospheric condition in batch reactor. Then, the gasoline composition of the organic liquid product (OLP) was analysed in terms of paraffin, isoparaffin, olefin, naphthenes and aromatics (PIONA). The results showed that Cu/ZSM-5 produced the highest liquid yield of 79.1%, at the same time reduced the production of gas and coke to 18.8% and 0.7%. Furthermore, the desired isoparaffin composition in biogasoline increased from 1.6% to 6.8% and at the same time reduced the oxygenated and aromatic compounds to 15.4% and 59.7%, respectively. The linoleic acid as model compound of rubber seed oil, in the catalytic cracking reaction provides a clearer understanding of the process. Besides, the water gas shift (WGS) reaction in catalytic cracking reaction provides insitu hydrogen production to saturate the branched olefin into the desired isoparaffin and the aromatics into naphthenes. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Currently, the use of energy from fossil fuels is generating serious environmental issues. On the other hand, a large amount of agro-industrial residues is produced without any specific use in Colombia. Nevertheless, potential applications related to the biomass upgrading into energy vectors has been encouraged in this country considering the biogas as a potential biofuel derived from agricultural wastes. Therefore, this work evaluates the simulation of the biogas production process from plantain pseudostem. For this, three scenarios have been proposed and simulated using the Aspen Plus Software. The first scenario only includes the plantain pseudostem anaerobic degradation without a pretreatment and biogas purification stages. The second scenario involves the acid pretreatment of the raw material and the biogas production using as substrate the mix between a xylose rich liquor and the acid pretreated solid. Instead, the third scenario includes an acid pretreatment stage and a biogas purification technology. The results show that the plantain pseudostem is a promising raw material to produce biogas. The application of the dilute acid pretreatment to the raw material allows increasing the methane yields. Moreover, the implementation of both pretreatment and methane concentration stages results in higher production costs. Nevertheless, the third scenario shown better performances since it has lower content of carbon dioxide. As conclusion, the biogas produced from renewable sources has a great potential to be used as biofuel and energy source for electricity generation in rural areas of Colombia. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Conventional biofuels, as biodiesel and bioethanol, are oxygenated compounds that have different physical-chemical properties when compared to fossil fuels. Otherwise, drop-in biofuels are bio-hydrocarbons that have the same chemical composition of fossil fuels. These oxygen-free fuels can be used without changes in structure that already exists to fossils fuels, as engines, turbines and tanks. This work presents the synthesis of bio-hydrocarbons via deoxygenation over Co/C catalyst using Macauba acid oil as feedstock. It is an inedible oil, with high acidity (about 38%) from a perennial palm tree with high oil productivity. Macauba endocarp activated carbon supported cobalt catalyst was synthesized and tested in order to develop a low cost and sustainable conversion route. Degree of deoxygenation of 98.4 %wt was achieved using Macauba pulp oil as feedstock, 10 wt% of catalyst, at temperature of 350 °C, pressure of 30 bar H2 for 4 h. The synthesized bio-hydrocarbons presented carbon chains equivalent to the fractions of gasoline, aviation kerosene and, mostly, diesel. These drop-in biofuels and the innovative catalyst appear as an important alternative for transport sector and for improving the sustainability of Macauba biorefinery. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Because of pollution problems, after the Mayors Summit 2016 takes place, certain European capital cities want to be free from diesel engines automotive equipped with diesel engine by the year 2020. Also, the International Energy Agency affirms that the per cent of bio energy must increase till the year of 2025 and estimates that biofuels can grow to as much as 30% of the world’s road transport fuel mix by 2050. The global share of biofuel in total transport fuel would grow from 2% today to 27% in 2050. According to a European Commission report on the Future Transport Fuels, the 2020 Red target could be supported by vehicles fuelled by fuels based also on animal fats. The objective of the paper is directly related with these worldwide aspects. The paper presents combustion aspects at a diesel engine fuelled by raw animal fats blended in per cent’s of 5% and 10% with diesel fuel. For the same engine adjustments, the preheated raw animal fats use leads to the decrease of in-cylinder pressure with 5% and 12%, depending on animal fats content. Even if the animal fat use provides the increase in the combustion duration with 20 CAD and later achieving per cycle of the mass fraction burned, the heat release rate decreases with 16% (at 5% animal fats) and 20% (at 10% animal fats) assuring the decreasing of the NOx emission level with 22% versus diesel fuel. The smoke opacity decreases with 22% (at 5% of animal fats in blends with diesel fuel) and with 52% at the rise of animal fats content to 10%. The novelty of the paper is assured by aspects like: an efficiently recover of raw animal fats from the leather industry assuring an important decrease of waste stocks and of financial costs, an optimal correlation between animal fats per cent and diesel engine combustion performance. The raw animal fats can be considered a very good alternative biofuel for the diesel engines and can be used for fuelling without major constructive modifications of the engine. © 2019, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - This study claimed for describing the synthesis and characterization of activated carbon doped transition metal (Mn, Fe) as effective and economic catalysts during catalytic cracking of waste cooking oil. The presented activated carbon was obtained from Peach crusts as economic, environmental and renewable resource. The prepared activated carbon and its transition metal doped forms were characterized using FTIR, XRD, thermogravimetric analysis, differential thermal analysis and N2-adsorption-desorption measurements. The physical and fuel properties of the obtained biofuels were approved compared to ASTM specifications. The performance of the different biofuel grades in engine tests was improved by blending regular diesel with 10% biofuel (BF10). The brake specific fuel consumption was decreased using BF10 blend. The brake thermal efficiency was also increased for BF10 from 16.21% to 27.25%. The brake specific fuel consumption was increased for BF10 blend compared to regular diesel. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Oil either from macaúba (Acrocomia aculeate) and palm (Elaeis guineensis) fruit kernel was transesterified with methanol through the classical reaction with homogeneous alkaline catalyst. The produced fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were further fractionated via atmospheric distillation as a step to obtain enriched fractions in short-molecular chain esters, ranging from C8 to C14, in a perspective to be blended with the conventional mineral jet fuel (Jet A-1). In this report, such blends of light biodiesels with Jet A-1 kerosene are described for their density, distillation fractions according to the temperature, structure changes under thermal treatments, by thermogravimetry and differential calorimetry analyses, freezing point, flash point, and calorific value. The blends corresponding to 5, 10 and 20 vol% in enriched short-chain esters with kerosene revealed values well within the recommended limits by the ASTM D1655. Light biodiesels, which are rich in lauric acid (C12:0) methyl esters are suitable to be blended with the Jet A-1 kerosene up to at least 5 vol%. Those blends could produce virtually very similar fuels, regarding the main technical standard properties, to the conventional fossil kerosene for jet engines, particularly concerning the moisture content, the density, its behavior in distillation and the flash point. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To facilitate the application of clean alternative fuels or fuel additives in compression ignition engines and a better understanding of the characteristics of their combustion and emission, physical biofuel surrogates are necessary to be proposed in computation and the knowledge of their thermophysical properties, such as liquid density, surface tension and viscosity, are also crucial for the design and optimization of the fuel injection system. Therefore, the surface light scattering (SLS) method was adopted for the simultaneous determination of the liquid surface tension and kinematic viscosity of the binary mixtures containing n-hexadecane, methyl butyrate and methyl decanoate in the temperature range between (353.15 and 423.15) K in the present work. Additionally, a U-tube densimeter and refractometer were used to obtain the liquid density and refractive index of the binary mixtures in the temperature range from (293.15–423.15) K and (293.15–358.15) K, respectively. Correlations for all thermophysical properties against temperature and mole fraction were also proposed. The relative deviations of liquid density, refractive index, kinematic viscosity as well as surface tension data from those calculated by the proposed equations were within ±0.3%, ±0.20%, ±2% and ±1%, respectively for the binary systems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bio fuel extracted from Cashew Nut Shell is a promising, low cost and renewable alternative that produce low emissions. In this work a mixture of diesel-cashew nut shell biofuel was supplemented with hydrogen to enhance combustion while at the same time, reduce the hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions. In an attempt to reduce the oxides of nitrogen, the exhaust gas circulation was attempted at 10%. The experiment is conducted in a single cylinder, 1500 rpm diesel engine. The load tests revealed that the hydrogen enriched biofuel with exhaust gas recirculation enhanced the thermal efficiency and simultaneously reduced the emission of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen. The thermal efficiency in hydrogen enriched biofuel dual fuel engine got increased from 31% to 36.5% when compared with biofuel mode. Further, the hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide reductions were reported at 20% and 10% respectively at full load. But the 40% increase in nitrogen oxides emission was observed in hydrogen-enriched biofuel engine. In exhaust gas circulation mode, there is a reduction of 26% nitrogen oxides emission was observed at 30% exhaust gas circulation with hydrogen-enriched biofuel mode. There was an increase in both in-cylinder pressure and heat release rate for hydrogen-enriched biofuel dual fuel mode, but it got decreased in exhaust gas circulation mode. Finally, the optimum combination of 10% exhaust gas circulation, 6lpm hydrogen flow rate and 20% biofuel led to the diminished levels of nitrogen oxides with mild upsurge in hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide and brake specific fuel consumption. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Exergy flow analysis is applied to account wastes, determine the exergetic efficiency, compare substitutes and other types of energy sources and also define economic and environmental policies for resource use. The present study focuses on the exergy flow analysis of biodiesel production by esterification and transesterification of waste cooking canola oil to achieve benefits such as reducing material and energy consumptions and improving energy and exergy efficiencies. The input amounts of esterification for all the runs were kept constant, while the runs of transesterification were carried out in a variety of mass and energy input values as the experimental variables. The thermodynamics analysis was applied to determine exergy input and output of the system for the experimental runs. Impacts of experiment variables, including methanol:oil molar ratio, potassium hydroxide concentration and the reaction temperature of transesterification were evaluated on exergy efficiency and exergy loss in the transesterification. The maximum exergy efficiency (91.7%) and the minimum exergy loss (4320 kJ/kg biodiesel) were achieved at methanol:oil molar ratio of 8:1, potassium hydroxide concentration of 1 wt% and the reaction temperature of 55 °C. Excessive use of methanol and catalyst reduced the yield and the exergy efficiency through increasing exergy loss by waste materials. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recently, the increase in energy demand motivated the researchers to study renewable energy sources. A significant portion of energy is consumed in transportation. Biofuels such as biodiesel are significant renewable sources of energy that can be utilized in this sector. In Asian countries such as Iran, with widespread use of diesel engines, biodiesel engines are likely to be combined in the system without modifications, since they share similar functionalities with diesel engines. Biodiesels can be extracted from different feedstocks such as microalgae that can grow in Iran. To perform a thorough analysis of the development of biodiesel in Iran, this paper applied strength-weakness-opportunity-threat (SWOT) structure to obtain suitable strategies. These strategies are ranked using a group decision-making method in fuzzy linguistic environment. Step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) is employed to weight the criteria, while fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) is utilized to consider casual relationships. Finally, weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS) is utilized to rank the strategies. As indicated in the results, a necessity in third-generation biodiesel production from microalgae is support by government with subsidy and financial policies. Additionally, developing technologies and encouraging private sectors to invest in this area are important strategies as well. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The main objective of this research work is to investigate the effect of multiwalled carbon nanotubes and cerium oxide nano-additives in lemon and orange peel oil biofuel blends in compression ignition engine. Eight different blends are prepared using lemon and orange peel oil in 20% volume ratio with diesel in which nanoparticles are added at two concentrations (50 and 100 ppm). The study revealed that brake thermal efficiency of carbon nanoparticle and cerium oxide addition with biofuels is marginally lower then diesel fuel. Furthermore, brake specific energy consumption for biofuel samples with and without nanoparticles are substantially lower than diesel fuel and in particular, the 50 ppm cerium oxide with lemon peel oil blend has resulted in 16.4% reduction in brake specific energy consumption. The Carbon nanotubes and cerium oxide in orange oil exhibit higher heat release rate high in-cylinder pressure than other fuel respectively. Moreover, the cerium oxide in orange oil at 50 ppm concentration has resulted in 53.8% reduction in carbon monoxide emission and similar kind of reduction is also observed in hydrocarbon emission as well. On the other hand, the nanoparticles addition with lemon peel and orange peel at all concentrations has shown only marginal reduction in NOx emission. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

In the first phase of work, at single fuel operation, study optimized the best fuel blend as B20 (among B10, B20, B30 and B100), injector opening pressure as 230 bar (among 210, 220, 230 and 240 bar), injection timing as 26. deg.bTDC (among 20, 23, 26 and 29. deg.bTDC), nozzle as 5 holes (among 3, 4 and 5 holes) and piston bowl geometry as re-entrant toroidal piston bowl geometry (among Hemispherical piston bowl geometry (HPBG), Straight sided piston bowl geometry (SSPBG), Toroidal piston bowl geometry (TPBG) and Re-entrant toroidal piston bowl geometry (RTPBG)). Hence, baseline engine is modified with all these optimized parameters and then modified engine is carried further for dual fuel experiments. In second phase of the work, study unfolds the effect of injection timing (IT) on dual fuelled (B20+Bio-CNG (enriched methane)) modified engine. From the dual fuelled engine study, it is revealed that 29. deg.bTDC IT has shown the improved performance, combustion and emission characteristics when compared to 20, 23, 26 and 32. deg.bTDC injection timings. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel as an alternative source of petroleum fuel could reduce the dependence on petroleum products and control pollution problems. These biofuels are derived from various sources and if directly used in the engine it will not completely burn and will cause an increase in the emission level. In this experiment, 20% of rubber seed oil (B20) blended with pure diesel fuel along with aluminium oxide (Al2O3) was used in the proportions of 10, 20 and 30 ppm. The obtained experimental results showed that the brake thermal efficiency was increased and the engine emission was reduced. And the brake-specific fuel consumption was reduced, but the NOx level increased at the proportion level at 10 ppm of nano additives. This experiment has been carried out in a single cylinder water-cooled engine connected to an electrical dynamometer without engine modification and the injection pressure and timings were maintained at the standard level designed for the engine. The dynamic energy of aluminium oxide blend with the biodiesel improved the combustion characteristics in the engine, and caused a reduction in carbon deposits by 44.8% in the cylinder wall. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In this work, two kinds of catalyst called monometallic Palladium (Pd) and a bimetallic of Pd-Iron (Fe) were synthesised using aluminum oxide (Al2O3) as the supported material via the wet impregnate method. A monometallic catalyst (0.5% Pd/Al2O3) named Pd cat was used as control. For the bimetallic catalyst, ratios of Pd to Fe were varied, and included 0.38% Pd–0.12% Fe (PF1), 0.25% Pd–0.25% Fe (PF2), and 0.12% Pd–0.38% Fe (PF3). The catalysts were characterised to investigate physical properties such as the surface area, pore size, porosity, and pore size distribution including their composition by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). Subsequently, all catalysts were applied for biofuels production in terms of green diesel/kerosene/gasoline from palm oil via a hydrocracking reaction. The results showed that the loading of Fe to Pd/Al2O3 could improve the active surface area, porosity, and pore diameter. Considering the catalytic efficiency for the hydrocracking reaction, the highest crude biofuel yield (94.00%) was obtained in the presence of PF3 catalyst, while Pd cat provided the highest refined biofuel yield (86.00%). The largest proportion of biofuel production was green diesel (50.00–62.02%) followed by green kerosene (31.71–43.02%) and green gasoline (6.10–8.11%), respectively. It was clearly shown that the Pd-Fe bimetallic and Pd monometallic catalysts showed potential for use as chemical catalysts in hydrocracking reactions for biofuel production. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Utilization of biofuels has drawn attention of researchers for many years to face depletion of fossil fuels. The high viscosity and low heating value of biodiesel are main drawbacks of using it along with high NOx emissions. Addition of ternary component to relax these drawbacks are widely considered. The focus of this study is to illustrate the effect of a novel ternary component to diesel-biodiesel blend on combustion characteristics, engine performance and emissions. This third component is cracked naphtha which is a low cetane/low octane fuel. Engine experiments were performed using a single cylinder, 4-stroke, air-cooled compression ignition (CI) engine. Different naphtha concentrations were considered. This included 5%, 10% and 15%. The engine performance results revealed that 10% and 5% are the maximum allowable percentages of naphtha to D100 and B30, respectively. A reduction in brake specific fuel consumption (bsfc) of 6.28% and 11.7% was achieved for 5% and 10% naphtha addition to diesel, respectively. Negligible effect was observed for naphtha on bsfc for B30–N5. Naphtha has decreased NOx emissions for B30–N5 at all considered loads and for diesel-naphtha blends at high and medium loads. CO emissions have been reduced for diesel-naphtha blends, while for B30–N5, CO emissions was increased. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Due to increasing concern of the Indonesian government towards the ever increasing national level of carbon emissions and the increasing demand of oil, in 2014 the Indonesian National Energy Council released the National Energy Policy which set the target of an increased renewable energy portion to become 23% of the total national energy consumption while setting a limit to oil consumption to be at most 25%. As the road transportation sector consumes more than 60% of the national oil consumption, measures targeting this sector will be important in fulfilling the target. A model has been set up to evaluate the impact of the measures on oil consumption via two main avenues: the substitution of oil based fuels with alternative fuels (e.g. biofuel, compressed natural gas/CNG), the reduction of oil consumption via vehicle retirement and the acceleration of fuel economy improvement for vehicles. Results have shown that it is important that policies consider the presence of older vehicles in the population since there is presently no vehicle retirement policy or penalty for older vehicles resulting in a large number of old vehicles still being operational. Thus, introduction of new vehicles will have a limited effect on the average fuel efficiency. Implementation of a vehicle retirement policy to reduce the amount of older vehicles is shown to be very effective in stemming the increase of oil consumption. In regards to fuel substitution, oil substitution with ethanol is most impactful, as most motor vehicles in Indonesia rely on gasoline including the rapidly increasing motorcycle population. While oil consumption is also reduced by biodiesel substitution, impact is more limited due to a smaller diesel vehicle population with a lower annual increase of vehicle population. In addition, financial, social and regulatory barriers exist that impend implementation of alternative fuels and vehicle limitation schemes. We also evaluated possible barriers and avenues that can further promote these measures to meet the national energy policy target. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - β-Pinene and paraformaldehyde can be activated over catalyst to preferentially produce nopol. Tin supported over MCM-41 has shown high activity in this reaction, achieving complete conversion of pure β-pinene and high selectivity toward nopol (>96%) with a key role of solvents such as toluene and ethyl acetate. In this work, the Prins reaction was performed with turpentine as β-pinene source, avoiding the use of solvents and reaching complete conversion of β-pinene and high selectivity toward nopol (>99%). In this case, α-pinene, which is a component of turpentine, can play the role of solvent. Besides, α-terpineol is also a product of the reaction, probably due to the hydration of limonene and α-pinene. The reaction was scaled-up to produce up to 3.5 L of oxyturpentine (oxyfunctionalized turpentine) with promising results. Sn-MCM-41 catalyst was synthesized by the hydrothermal method at room temperature, providing an easy scale-up of the process. On the basis of the high performance of the production reaction of oxyturpentine, it is a promising biofuel, although a complete assessment of its properties and performance in engine tests is pending. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Sorption enhanced gasification (SEG) is a promising technology for production of a renewable feedstock gas for biofuel synthesis processes. The technology has been previously demonstrated at pilot scale. Scaling of the technology to an industrial size requires knowledge from governing phenomena. One-dimensional bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) reactor model was developed and validated against experimental data from 200kWth dual fluidized bed facility. Sub-models for biomass gasification, reactive bed material and fluidized bed hydrodynamics were incorporated into the model frame. The model gave satisfactory predictions for bed material conversion, temperature profiles and gas composition of the producer gas. The conducted validation improved understanding of bed material conversion, water–gas shift reaction and hydrodynamics and their role in SEG reactors. Further refinement and comprehensive validation of the model with additional data from the pilot is required. The knowledge from the comprehensive validation can be utilized in simulation of an industrial size reactor. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Seed oil production in Jatropha seeds through different maturity stages have been investigated. In order to meet the high demand of oil (feedstock) for large scale biodiesel production, increasing oil content or output in Jatropha seeds is required. Jatropha fruits were harvested at four different maturity stages and the seeds were analysed for oil content. The seed oil was analysed for fatty acid profile. Results from four different geographical locations investigated namely; Mmadinare, Thamaga, Maun and Shashe, have shown a similar trend in lipid accumulation in Jatropha seeds as the fruits mature from green to brown dry. However, maximum oil content in seeds varies with geographical location. Accumulation of oil in Jatropha seeds during maturation follows a parabolic trend and reaches its peak when fruits are yellow. Oil yield in Jatropha seed kernels ranges from 38.7% to 45.8% for the four maturity stages investigated. Overall results have revealed that harvesting Jatropha fruits when they are yellow increases seed oil output by 6–9% when compared to harvesting the fruits when they are brown dry. There is a relationship between the trend in fatty acid composition in Jatropha seed oil and seed oil content trend during fruit maturation. Based on the trend of unsaturated fatty acids in Jatropha seed oil, particularly linoleic and oleic acids, it can be deduced that reduction of seed oil content from yellow brown to brown dry stage is a result of breakdown of some of the unsaturated fatty acids. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - The aim of this study was to select cultivation conditions for the production of extracellular biosurfactants from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This yeast has been recognized due to the production of intracellular biosurfactants, and this work presented a technique to produce extracellular biosurfactants, allowing the reduction in costs with downstream processes. We studied the scale up of production in bioreactors and their effects on bioremediation in soils contaminated with biodiesel. Furthermore, we also evaluated the effects of biosurfactant addition on the adsorption of contaminants in these soils. The concentration and types of inducer (glycerol, soybean oil and diesel oil), pH levels and temperatures were studied to maximize the production through factorial designs. The results that obtained the maximum emulsifying production (6.95 UE d−1) were found in the concentration of 5 g L−1 of glycerol, a pH 5.5 and a temperature of 30 °C. In the scale up of the 5 L bioreactor, the maximum productivity of 3.85 UE d−1 was achieved in 2 days. The addition of 0.05%, 0.1% and 0.5% of biosurfactant in soil contaminated with 20% of biodiesel for 90 days allowed a biodegradation of 56.71% with a 0.5% of biosurfactant. For all evaluated conditions, 25% of the biodegradation value should actually be attributed to the adsorption process. The addition of biosurfactants does not affect the retention of the contaminant in the soil, demonstrating that the biosurfactants improved biodegradation without interfering in the adsorption process of the contaminant in the selected soil, which is important in order to avoid influencing the movement processes of contamination plumes. © 2019, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - Waste cooking oil (WCO) is a potential and low-cost source for biodiesel production which has been used widely. In this study, novel nanocatalyst (GO@ZrO2–SrO) was synthesized via co-precipitation method by the combination of both potential graphene oxide and bimetal zirconium/strontium oxide nanoparticles. The proposed nanocomposite showed a promising ability as a heterogeneous catalyst for the transesterification of WCO to produce FAMEs as biodiesel. The FTIR, SEM/EDX and XRD were used for the characterization of nanocatalyst to evaluate the surface functional groups, nanostructure/elements and crystallinity, respectively. The effective parameters on the transesterification FAMEs yield including oil to alcohol ratio, reaction time, and reaction temperature were studied. Based on the results, the maximum FAMEs yield of 91% was obtained in the conditions of the material ratio of 1:0.5 (w/w) of GO:ZrO2–SrO, oil to methanol ratio (1:4), the reaction time of 90 min and the temperature of 120 °C. Therefore, this study showed that GO@ZrO2–SrO can be used as an alternative potential heterogeneous catalyst to produce biodiesel from WCO. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study describes the production of biodiesel via the enzymatic transesterification reaction, using waste cooking oil as a substrate. Lipases from Candida rugosa and Rhizomucor miehei were immobilised on polyhydroxybutyrate to serve as environment-friendly catalysts. This enzyme mixture yielded the highest biodiesel production. The optimum conditions for biodiesel production included a reaction temperature of 45 °C, 5% water content, 1% of mixed lipase (50% of each lipase), a methanol:oil ratio of 6:1, a 24-h reaction period, and a 250 rpm stirring speed, which resulted in the highest biodiesel yields (96.5%). This catalyst can be reused for more than six cycles, after which the lipase activity begins to decrease. The chemical and fuel properties such as the density at 15 °C, viscosity at 40 °C and cloud point of the resulting biodiesel were similar to those of other diesels/biodiesels and complied with international specifications (EN 14214 and ASTM D 6751). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Due to its environment-friendly and replenishable characteristics, biodiesel has the potential to substitute fossil fuels as an alternative source of energy. Although biodiesel has many benefits to offer, manufacturing biodiesel on an industrial scale is uneconomical as a high cost of feedstock is required. A novel sulfonated and magnetic catalyst synthesised from a palm kernel shell (PMB-SO3H) was first introduced in this study for methyl ester or biodiesel production to reduce capital costs. The wasted palm kernel shell (PKS) biochar impregnated with ferrite Fe3O4 was synthesised with concentrated sulphuric acid through the sulfonation process. The SEM, EDX, FTIR, VSM and TGA characterization of the catalysts were presented. Then, the optimisation of biodiesel synthesis was catalysed by PMB-SO3H via the Response Surface Methodology (RSM). It was found that the maximum biodiesel yield of 90.2% was achieved under these optimum operating conditions: 65 °C, 102 min, methanol to oil ratio of 13:1 and the catalyst loading of 3.66 wt%. Overall, PMB-SO3H demonstrated acceptable catalysing capability on its first cycle, which subsequently showed a reduction of the reusability performance after 4 cycles. An important practical implication is that PMB-SO3H can be established as a promising heterogeneous catalyst by incorporating an iron layer which can substantially improve the catalyst separation performance in biodiesel production. © 2020

AB  - The environmental impact of biodiesel production from waste cooking oil has been previously evaluated through life cycle assessment and, in all cases, it presents a lower ecological burden compared to first and third-generation biodiesel. However, production-use studies are scarce, particularly in the case of biodiesel consumption for power generation, at large and reduced scale. Thus, there is high uncertainty as to the combined contribution of the production process and exhaust emissions to the overall environmental footprint of biodiesel. This work performs a comparative analysis of the environmental impacts associated with the production and use of B25 biodiesel blend and ultra-low sulphur diesel in a power generator of 33 kW, at 100% of rated load and using life cycle methodology to characterise the derived impacts, based on primary data for process and use stages. The results of the modelling showed that B25 outperforms ultra-low sulphur diesel in all categories. Major impact reductions were found for abiotic depletion, potential for human toxicity, eutrophication potential, acidification potential, and global warming potential categories with 39.48%, 39.44%, 39.24%, 38.73%, and 35.77% respectively. Experimental measurement of exhaust emissions showed an increase in CO (52%) and a decrease in NOx (41.54%) for B25, compared to ultra-low sulphur diesel. The overall results indicate that the use of biodiesel blends in power generators could offer important environmental benefits from a life cycle perspective. However, a careful evaluation of engine specifications must be carried out when higher biodiesel blends are used, in order to maximise these benefits. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The most common reaction for biodiesel production is catalysed by acid, base or enzyme catalysts. When transesterification is completed, the reaction mixture contains various impurities such as soap, catalyst, free glycerol and alcohol that have to be removed to meet the biodiesel international standard specifications. In this work, biodiesel was produced by lipase catalysed transesterification from edible sunflower oil and methanol as substrates. The purification of crude biodiesel was carried out by decantation followed by ultrafiltration membrane technology. Four different membranes, polyethersulfone, polyacrylonitrile, polypropylene and regenerated cellulose were selected and used for biodiesel ultrafiltration. Based on permeate flux and glycerol content in the permeate membrane performance was evaluated. The obtained results showed that two out of four tested membranes have potential for biodiesel purification. Polyacrylonitrile membrane showed the best performance resulting in lowest glycerol content in permeate (0.006% (w/w)). Additionally, polyacrylonitrile membrane was successfully reused six times without significant loss of performance. Furthermore, the membrane blocking mechanisms were analysed for all membranes by Hermina's model. Consequently, complete cake layer formation was identified as the most dominant blocking effect. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction is a promising technology to upgrade wet organic waste into a biocrude oil for diesel or jet fuel; however, this process generates an acid-rich aqueous phase which poses disposal issues. This hydrothermal liquefaction aqueous phase (HTL-AP) contains organic acids, phenol, and other toxins. This work demonstrates that Y. lipolytica as a unique host to valorize HTL-AP into a variety of co-products. Specifically, strains of Y. lipolytica can tolerate HTL-AP at 10% in defined media and 25% in rich media. The addition of HTL-AP enhances production of the polymer precursor itaconic acid by 3-fold and the polyketide triacetic acid lactone at least 2-fold. Additional co-products (lipids and citric acid) were produced in these fermentations. Finally, bioreactor cultivation enabled 21.6 g/L triacetic acid lactone from 20% HTL-AP in mixed sugar hydrolysate. These results demonstrate the first use of Y. lipolytica in HTL-AP valorization toward production of a portfolio of value-added compounds. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The rising demands of energy and strict regulations of government associated with toxic gases emitted from utilization of conventional fuels are motivating towards biofuels mainly biodiesel. However, some constraints for employing biodiesel as substitution fuel are higher viscosity, nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The main intention of this work is to explore biodiesel production and examine the influence of butanol (Bu)-biodiesel (B)-diesel fuels on the diesel engine. In present work, biodiesel (B) is prepared from eucalyptus oil and B20 (20%biodiesel-80%diesel), B100 (neat biodiesel), B20-5Bu (20%biodiesel-75%diesel-5%butanol), B20-10Bu (20%biodiesel-70%diesel-10%butanol) and B20-15Bu (20%biodiesel-65%diesel-15%butanol) prepared fuel samples are tested with varying engine load at 1500 rpm in diesel engine. Approximately 92% yield of biodiesel is obtained with base-catalyzed transesterification method at pre-determined methanol-oil ratio (8:1) and 0.1% (wt) sodium hydroxide (NaOH) catalyst at 65 °C reaction temperature for 3 hrs. It is found that slight increase in brake power (BP) and higher brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) are attained with butanol-biodiesel-diesel fuels, while brake thermal efficiency (BTE) is decreased. At full load, the results are indicated that 10% and 20% average reduction in carbon mono-oxide (CO); 36.7% and 46% unburnt hydrocarbon (HC) emissions are declined for B20 and B100 respectively. Moreover, the NOx and CO2 emissions are found to be increased than diesel. B20-5Bu, B20-10Bu and B20-15Bu shows 23.55%, 21.9% and 25.16% average decrease in NOx emission at great extent, due to cooling effect of butanol. Finally, it is proclaimed that butanol-diesel-biodiesel can become a promising fuel as same as diesel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Considering global scenario of international market for cashew nut, its industrial processing has great economic consideration. Availability of all essential amino acids in cashew nuts rewards it as nutrition dense crop, providing cashew nuts in the form of dry fruits. Industrial processing of cashew nut generates various by-products/residues, which also cause environmental concerns. These include cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL), testa, cashew apple, and cashew apple bagasse. These by-products are industrially significant as they can be processed to form several bioactive compounds, polymers and other products, thus making the process and products economic and environmental friendly and sustainable. Cashew apple bagasse is rich in organic nature and could be a potent source of lignocellulosic material for the production of bioethanol and other microbial products through biological processes. CNSL is enriched with numerous phenolic compounds and has potential benefits for usage in preparation of coatings and laminates. Therefore, proper management of cashew crop residues could not only lead to high revenue generation, but it also offers environmental sustainability. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The first EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED) served as an effective push for world-wide research efforts on biofuels and bioliquids, i.e. liquid fuels for energy purposes other than for transport, including electricity, heating, and cooling, which are produced from biomass. In December 2018 the new RED II was published in the Official Journal of the European Union. Therefore, it is now the right time to provide a comprehensive overview of achievements and practices that were developed within the current perspective. To comply with this objective, the present study focuses on a comprehensive and systematic technical evaluation of all key aspects of the different distributed energy generation pathways using bioliquids in reciprocating engines and micro gas turbines that were overseen by these EU actions. Methodologically, the study originates from the analyses of feedstock and fuel processing technologies, which decisively influence fuel properties. The study systematically and holistically highlights the utilisation of these bioliquids in terms of fuel property specific challenges, required engine adaptations, and equipment durability, culminating in analyses of engine performance and emissions. In addition, innovative proposals and future opportunities for further technical improvements in the whole production-consumption cycle are presented, thus serving as a guideline for upcoming research and development activities in the fast-growing area of bioliquids. Additionally, the paper systematically addresses opportunities for the utilisation of waste streams, emerging from the ever increasing circular use of materials and resources. With this, the present review provides the sorely needed link between past efforts, oriented towards the exploitation of bio-based resources for power generation, and the very recent zero-waste oriented society that will require a realistic exploitation plan for residuals originating from intensive material looping. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - In the present study, a new biorefinery approach for efficient conversion of chicken manure mixed with rapeseed straw was investigated through anaerobic co-digestion though digestate recycling. The liquid digestate fraction was used for straw pretreatment, while solid fraction was utilized for rearing the black soldier fly larvae. Anaerobic digestion of raw straw resulted in biomethane yield of 144.2 L kg−1 VS, while the pretreatment enhanced it to 227.6 L kg−1 VS. Co-digestion of the pretreated straw with chicken manure at different ratios of 1:1, 1:3, and 3:1 increased the biomethane yield to 323.5, 349.6, and 262.3 L kg−1 VS, respectively, with higher biomethanation efficiency. Black soldier fly larvae were grown on different ratios of solid digestate/larva (D/L) of 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.00, where it showed higher growth and faster development by increasing the digestate ratio. In addition, lipid content significantly increased by increasing the digestate ratio, reaching the maximum values of 31.8 dw% at 1.00 D/L. Therefore, the highest fatty acid methyl esters recovery of 301.8 mg g−1 dw was recorded at 1.00 D/L, with pronounced enhanced biodiesel characteristics. The suggested integrated approach using a mixture of liquid digestate-pretreated straw to manure at a ratio of 1:3 for dual purpose of biogas and biodiesel production enhanced the gross bioenergy yield by 95.7%, 24.6%, and 38.7% over those of raw rapeseed straw, pretreated straw, or chicken manure, respectively. The present study demonstrates an innovative waste-to-energy route that will have a positive impact on the future of biofuel industry. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Direct air capture (DAC) separates carbon dioxide (CO2) from ambient air either chemically or physically. As such, it could be a potential climate mitigation tool when paired with geological sequestration of CO2or downstream conversion to produce products with low life cycle carbon intensities. Of particular interest is the ability to pair CO2from DAC with electrolytic hydrogen powered by renewable electricity to synthesize liquid hydrocarbons that can be used in transportation (often referred to as “e-fuels”). This presents a pathway additional to electric and fuel cell vehicles to harness renewable electricity for use in the transportation sector and may present an attractive opportunity as costs of renewable electricity and electrolysis equipment continue to fall. We conduct a life cycle assessment (LCA) of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of a DAC system paired with Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) to produce transportation fuel (i.e., diesel). This is the first LCA study of a DAC-to-fuel process based on data from an operating DAC pilot plant. We estimate the system emits 0.51 gCO2e per gCO2captured from air or 29 gCO2e per MJ FTS fuel combusted in the baseline scenario, in which the electricity emissions factor used in the process is relatively low. This carbon intensity (CI) is extremely sensitive to changes in the electricity emissions factor. We find that an electricity emissions factor of less than 139 g CO2e per kW h is required for this pathway to provide a climate benefit over conventional diesel fuel. If a low carbon source of electricity is used, this pathway can deliver transport fuels at a CI lower than conventional diesel production and several biofuel pathways. This analysis suggests that fuel synthesis facilities need to be located in regions with very low grid emissions factors, or preferentially, co-located with new-build renewable electricity. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.

AB  - The design of cost-effective and high-performance bimetallic catalysts has become crucial for the effective conversion of biomass-derived pyrolysis-oil (Py-oil) into liquid biofuels. New bimetallic Ni3Fe catalysts were developed for effective hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of Py-oil derived from date seeds. Ni3Fe catalyst showed a well-defined octagon-like morphology with a diameter of 120 nm and high saturation magnetization (Ms) of 78 emu g−1 at room temperature. Py-oil was subjected to catalytic HDO processes at 250 °C for 120 min in a 10 bar H2 atmosphere in the presence of Ni3Fe catalyst. Characterization results confirmed HDO of several components of Py-oil, including phenols, acids, aldehyde and ketones, sugars and aromatic hydrocarbons over the surfaces of Ni3Fe catalyst. The obtained upgraded Py-oil (HDO Py-oil) showed the highest hydrocarbons content of 23.77%, higher heating value (HHV) of 36.78 MJ kg−1, and lower content of water, total acid number, and viscosity than fresh Py-oil. Bimetallic Ni3Fe catalyst resulted in better HDO performance and re-usability for five consecutive cycles than recently reported monometallic or noble metal nanocatalysts. Plausible reaction pathways for the formation of major components including ethane, ethyl acetate, 2,5-dimethylfuran, D-sorbitol, methylcyclohexane, furfural alcohol, and 1,5-pentane diols are discussed. Results demonstrate that this simple and active bimetallic catalytic system leads to a cutting-edge liquid biofuels production pathway in the future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To decrease the dependence on crude oil, biomass derived liquid transportation fuels are highly desirable. Butyl levulinate is a potential cellulose-derived biofuel additive with properties similar to diesel and low water solubility. Herein we report a direct one-pot production of levulinic acid ester, butyl levulinate, from furfuryl alcohol by alcoholysis using n-butanol. The partial tin exchanged tungstophosphoric acid (TPA) supported on montmorillonite K-10 catalysts showed facile alcoholysis of furfuryl alcohol to levulinate ester under mild temperature conditions. Partially exchanging the H+ ion of TPA with Sn (x = 1) resulted in enhanced acidity of the catalyst and showed an increase in the catalytic activity as compared to TPA/K-10 catalyst. A series of tin exchanged tungstophosphoric acid (20 % w/w) supported on montmorillonite K-10 clay (Snx-TPA/K-10, where x = 0.5–1.5) were synthesized and thoroughly characterized by using XRD, FT-IR, UV-VIS, titration and SEM techniques. Among various catalysts, Sn1-TPA/K-10 was found to be the most active catalyst for butyl levulinate synthesis. Two different clay supports and varying tin loadings were used to study the effects on surface acidity as well as catalytic activity in butyl levulinate synthesis. Effects of different reaction parameters were studied and optimized to get high yields of butyl levulinate. Under mild reaction conditions at 110 °C, complete conversion of furfuryl alcohol with 98 % selectivity to butyl levulinate was achieved. The prepared catalyst could be recycled at least five times without significant loss of activity. The overall process is green and clean. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cyanobacterial biofuels have the potential to reduce the cost and climate impacts of biofuel production because primary carbon fixation and conversion to fuel are completed together in the cultivation of the cyanobacteria. Cyanobacterial biofuels, therefore, do not rely on costly organic carbon feedstocks that heterotrophs require, which reduces competition for agricultural resources such as arable land and freshwater. However, the published product titer achieved for most molecules of interest using cyanobacteria lag behind what has been achieved using yeast and Escherichia coli (E. coli) cultures. In Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (S. 6803), we attempted to increase the product titer of the sesquiterpene, bisabolene, which may be converted to bisabolane, a possible diesel replacement. We tested 19 strains of genetically modified S. 6803 with five different codon usage sequences of the bisabolene synthase from the grand fir tree (Abies grandis). At least three ribosome binding sites (most designed using the RBS Calculator) were tested for each codon usage sequence. We also tested strains with and without the farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase gene from E. coli. Bisabolene titers after five days of growth in continuous light ranged from un-detected to 7.8 ​mg/L. Bisabolene synthase abundance was measured and found to be well correlated with titer. Select strains were also tested in 12:12 light:dark cycles, where similar titers were reached after the same amount of light exposure time. One engineered strain was also tested in photobioreactors exposed to a simulated outdoor light pattern with maximum light intensity of 1600 ​μmol photons m−2 s−1. Here, the bisabolene titer reached 22.2 ​mg/L after 36 days of growth. Dramatic improvements in our ability to control gene expression in cyanobacteria such as S. 6803, and the co-utilization of additional metabolic engineering methods, are needed in order for these titers to improve to the levels reported for engineered E. coli. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Catalyst waste from the residue fluid catalytic cracking (RFCC) plant process can still be utilized to catalyze the catalytic cracking of palm oil to fuels. However, we should regenerate the active sites of the catalyst waste. This paper focuses on enhancement of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites on the spent RFCC catalyst waste through various acid treatments in order to regenerate its catalyst active sites. In order to regenerate the Brønsted and the Lewis acid sites as active sites in the palm oil catalytic cracking, the spent RFCC catalyst was treated by citric acid, sulfuric acid, and mixture of both acids. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller-Barrett-Joyner-Halenda, and pyridine-FTIR analysis. The modified catalyst performance was tested over a fixed bed reactor for the catalytic cracking process of palm oil to liquid fuels. It was found that the acid treatment on the spent RFCC catalyst can increase surface area, pore volume, and Brønsted to Lewis acid site ratio of catalysts. The Brønsted acid sites of the spent RFCC catalyst strongly increase by the treatment using sulfuric acid, which is because of the proton transfer from acid to catalyst and because of the formation of sulfate groups (HOSO3-) in the catalysts. It was found that the Brønsted acid site leads to the formation of long-chain hydrocarbon, while the Lewis acid site pronounces the formation of short-chain hydrocarbon and coke. Moreover, the total acidity and the Lewis acid site amount on the catalyst have roles in the formation of hydrocarbon fraction in the liquid product. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In order to enhance the yield of high quality biodiesel form diseased swine fat, the ultrasound-assisted two-step catalyzed process was employed. First, three-dimensional ultrasound-assisted concentrated sulfuric acid pre-esterification experiment was carried out. Then, the transesterification reaction catalyzed by KOH was performed, and four parameters (catalyst concentration, reaction time, methanol/oil molar ratio and reaction temperature) were optimized using response surface methodology. The results showed that the optimal transesterification reaction conditions were catalyst concentration of 1.11 wt%, reaction temperature of 62.3 °C, methanol/oil molar ratio of 7.42:1, and reaction time of 116.14 min. The most significant factor affecting biodiesel purity was identified as catalyst concentration. Under the optimal conditions, the maximum biodiesel purity reached to 98% with the reaction time of 176.14 min, shortened by 63.3% compared with previous works. Furthermore, most of the biodiesel properties agreed the quality requirements established by Official Regulations of GB/25199-2017 of China. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is a green and sustainable energy, which is a fatty acid alkyl ester as an alternative to petroleum diesel. In the work, phoenix tree seed oil, one kind of undeveloped woody plant resource, was used as the novel raw material for biodiesel preparation. Several free liquid lipases were used as biocatalysts to catalyze the transesterification of phoenix tree seed oil (PTSO) with methanol. Effects of transesterification variables (enzyme load, substrate ratio, transesterification time and temperature) on biodiesel preparation were evaluated and optimized using RSM. Results showed that PTSO was a good alternative for biodiesel preparation. Among these tested free liquid lipases, lipozyme TL100L from Thermomyces laguginosus showed the best performance for the transesterification. Transesterification variables were optimized and the maximum biodiesel yield (98.8 ± 1.1%) was achieved under the optimal conditions (enzyme load 10%, transesterification temperature 30 °C, substrate ratio (PTSO to methanol) 1:5 (mol/mol) and reaction time 6.98 h). The activation energy of biodiesel formation was 21.3 kJ/mol. Kinetic parameters K’m and Vmax were 2.55 × 10−1 mol/L and 6.9 × 10−3 mol/(L·min), respectively. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The cement industry generates a substantial amount of gaseous pollutants that cannot be treated efficiently and economically using standard techniques. Microalgae, a promising bioremediation and biodegradation agent used as feedstock for biofuel production, can be used for the biotreatment of cement flue gas. In specific, components of cement flue gas such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and sulfur oxides are shown to serve as nutrients for microalgae. Microalgae also have the capacity to sequestrate heavy metals present in cement kiln dust, adding further benefits. This work provides an extensive overview of multiple approaches taken in the inclusion of microalgae biofuel production in the cement sector. In addition, factors influencing the production of microalgal biomass are also described in such an integrated plant. In addition, process limitations such as the adverse impact of flue gas on medium pH, exhaust gas toxicity, and efficient delivery of carbon dioxide to media are also discussed. Finally, the article concludes by proposing the future potential for incorporating the microalgae biofuel plant into the cement sector. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The effects of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) on the combustion, performance, and emissions of a six-cylinder turbocharged common-rail dimethyl ether engine with biodiesel blends were experimentally investigated. The proportions of biodiesel were 0% (B0), 5% (B5), 10% (B10), 15% (B15) and 20% (B20) by weight, and the effect of the engine load was considered. The results indicate that a higher EGR rate increases the ignition delay and combustion duration. The peak rate of heat release increases as the EGR rate increases at low loads but decreases at high loads. The present investigation shows that the EGR strategy is effective for suppressing NOx formation and the NOx emissions approximately linearly decrease as the EGR rate increases. The retardation of the combustion phase by external EGR effectively reduces the rate of pressure increase. The effect of the biodiesel proportion on the combustion and performance of an engine is complex, and the B5 blend showed the shortest ignition delay and the highest brake thermal efficiency. The influence of the biodiesel proportion on the EGR is not obvious. The disadvantages of EGR and biodiesel addition include the resultant increases in the CO and HC emissions and the particle number concentration. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biofuels are one of the short-term alternatives for reducing the well-to-wheel greenhouse gas footprint of transport. In the framework of compression-ignition engine fuels. This study investigates the feasibility of using cold-pressed rapeseed oil as a biocomponent, admixed with distilled tyre pyrolytic oil, as an energy-efficient alternative to commonly considered methyl ester-based mixtures in diesel fuel. Selected ternary and binary fuel blends are subjected to engine tests. Their scope covers 80% of the engine map and aims at identifying tradeoffs between fuel composition, engine performance and emissions. The results show that fuel mixtures containing a large fraction of rapeseed oil (up to 55% by volume) can be effectively combusted when pyrolytic oil distillate is introduced as the additive. The deterioration in brake efficiency for such fuel does not exceed 1.2% with respect to diesel baseline. At the same time, the results are superior in terms of both efficiency and emissions when compared to FAME-based biodiesel. Finally, with indicated efficiencies on a similar level as the diesel baseline, suggesting improved burning rate with pyrolytic oil addition, the study identifies parasitic losses in fuel injection equipment as a significant contributor to the overall efficiency penalty for the examined ternary mixtures. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study attempts to study the influences of piston geometry, butanol fumigation, EGR, injection pressure and injection timing upon the performance and emissions of a light-duty DI diesel engine fuelled with diesel, Jatropha methyl ester (JME) and 20% by vol. of n-butanol/diesel blends. Experiments were designed based on Taguchi L18 orthogonal array that considered main fuel injection timing, EGR, premixing ratio of n-butanol with diesel, injection pressure, secondary injection timing, piston geometry, main injection fuel and secondary injection fuel as factors and NOx emission, smoke opacity and BSFC as responses. The best combination of the above factor levels were predicted by using desirability function. Results indicated that B20 injected at 20°CA bTDC with an injection pressure of 200 bar under 10% EGR alongside 40% by vol. of butanol/diesel fumigation with a premixing ratio of 20% at 9°CA aTDC in the engine fitted with a torroidal piston was predicted to deliver 359.13 ppm of NOx emissions, 74.83% of smoke opacity with 1.127kg/kWh of BSFC. The tests revealed that the predictions by using desirability function were within a reasonable accuracy of 10%. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Three dual-fuel strategies, i.e. Strategy S (syngas-biodiesel), Strategy U (upgraded syngas-biodiesel), and Strategy D (DME-biodiesel), for utilization of syngas and biodiesel from biomass wastes in internal combustion engines have been proposed in this study. To compare both the combustion and emission performance of the three strategies, an integrated KIVA4-CHEMKIN CFD platform was constructed implementing a newly combined reaction mechanism. Effects of three dual-fuel strategies have been compared against each other in terms of indicated power, NOx and soot emission. At different engine loads, it was found that the indicated power of all strategies increased with the increasing supplement ratio. Strategy S and Strategy U predict higher indicated power than Strategy D at the high engine load, while lower indicated power than Strategy D at the low engine load. As regards to the NOx emission, an increase in the fuel supplement ratio increases the NOx emission (g/kWh) for both Strategy S and Strategy U at high engine loads, while decreases the NOx emission (g/kWh) due to the enhanced indicated power. Strategy D has relatively higher NOx emission (g/kWh) than Strategy S and Strategy U at all loads. With the increase in fuel supplement ratio, the soot emission generally shows a decreasing trend at all engine loads for all strategies, and Strategy D emits less soot than Strategy S and Strategy U in the cases of high fuel supplement ratio (>0.4) for all engine load conditions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A new biofuel concept is developed, enabling the usage of vegetable oils and glycerol derivatives in mixtures with biodiesel. This concept significantly enhances the biodiesel production's profitability and thus strongly contributes to the sustainability of future biofuels. After simple addition reactions with building block chemicals, less hydrophilic glycerol derivatives are obtained, which are compatible with biofuels. Even more, the products of the reactions of glycerol with acetone or butyric acid, referred to as solketal and tributyrin, respectively, lead to promising biofuels in mixtures with rapeseed oil and its biodiesel. Due to their low freezing points, they act as cloud and freezing point depressants, when added to vegetable oil/biodiesel blends. Further, since their viscosity is close to common biodiesel, biofuels containing high amounts of vegetable oil and even more glycerol derivatives than they arise during the biodiesel production can be obtained. Thus, this new class of biofuels enables adaptable compositions depending on the application and also the usage as drop-in fuel without any or just few percent of further additives. After optimising the formulations, ignition delay, exhaust gas recirculation, fuel consumption and combustion process measurements were performed in an unmodified upto-date diesel engine. The experiments showed that the properties of the formulated biofuels are either similar to or even better than diesel. The hydrotropy of the glycerol derivatives in these mixtures enables the potential to implement water into biofuels, so-called hydrofuels, reducing nitrogen oxide emissions and leading to further optimised dropin fuels. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Without sufficient alternatives to crude oil, as demand continues to rise, the global economy will undergo a drastic decline as oil prices explode. Dependence on crude oil and growing environmental impairment must eventually be overcome by creating a sustainable and profitable alternative based on renewable and accessible feedstock. One of the promising solutions for the current and near-future is the substitution of fossil fuels with sustainable liquid feedstock for biofuel production. Among the different renewable liquid feedstock's studied, wastewater is the least explored one for biodiesel production. Sago wastewater is the byproduct of the cassava processing industry and has starch content ranging from 4 to 7%. The present investigation was aimed to produce microbial lipids from oleaginous yeast, Candida tropicalis ASY2 for use as biodiesel feedstock and simultaneously decontaminate the sago processing wastewater for reuse. Initial screening of oleaginous yeast to find an efficient amylolytic with maximum lipid productivity resulted in a potent oleaginous yeast strain, C. tropicalis ASY2, that utilizes SWW as a substrate. Shake flask experiments are conducted over a fermentation time of 240 h to determine a suitable fatty acid composition using GC-FID for biodiesel production with simultaneous removal of SWW pollutants using ASY2. Results: The maximum biomass of 0.021 g L-1 h-1 and lipid productivity of 0.010 g L-1 h-1 was recorded in SWW with lipid content of 49%. The yeast strain degraded cyanide in SWW (79%) and also removed chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), nitrate (NO3), ammoniacal (NH4), and phosphate (PO4) ions (84%, 92%, 100%, 98%, and 85%, respectively). GC-FID analysis of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) revealed high oleic acid content (41.33%), which is one of the primary fatty acids for biodiesel production. Conclusions: It is evident that the present study provides an innovative and ecologically sustainable technology that generates valuable fuel, biodiesel using SWW as a substrate and decontaminates for reuse. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - In this study, calcium titanate nano-particles (CaTiO3 NPs) were synthesized through solution combustion synthesis (SCS) by using Ochrocarpus longifolius leaves extract as a novel fuel. The CaTiO3 NPs were successfully utilized in the biodiesel synthesis from dairy waste scum oil (DWSO) as a heterogeneous base catalyst. The synthesized CaTiO3 NPs were characterized by SEM, XRD, TEM, BET, FT-IR and CO2-TPD. Response surface methodology (RSM) in arrangement with central composite design (CCD) was utilized to determine the optimum conditions for biodiesel production by varying catalyst loading, molar ratio and reaction time. The maximum 97.7% yield of dairy waste scum oil methyl ester (DWSOME/biodiesel) was obtained for a molar ratio (methanol to DWSO) of 9:1, 1.80 wt% catalyst loading and 45 min reaction time with constant temperature (65 °C) and stirring speed (650 rpm). The CaTiO3 NPs shows a good catalytic stability up to five cycles with a low loss of yield. The kinetic study of biodiesel production fit well to pseudo-first order reaction. For transesterification reaction, the 35.56 kJ/mol of activation energy (Ea) was found. Finally, the DWSOME was characterized by 1H NMR and the fuel properties were also determined and were in the range of ASTM standards. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The study to improve the characteristics in terms of performance, emission and combustion aspects without any modification to a direct injection compression ignition engine using pine oil blend and additive addition was executed. Biofuels known for their reduction in emission also degrades the engine’s performance value. To overcome this, pine oil mixture was used with an additive (1,4-dioxane). Pine oil taken at two different concentrations (P20, P40) and the additive at two varying proportions (5 ml, 10 ml) were utilized. In total, six pine oil mixtures were prepared and analyzed for the emission, performance and combustion aspects of the test engine and compared with diesel values. The result evidenced the rise of 3.88% and 5.57% for brake thermal efficiency and fuel consumption, respectively, for P20-10 ml blend compared with diesel. Contemplating the emission aspects, considerable decrease in pollutants (22.41% CO, 29.19% HC and 22.80% smoke) excluding NOx and CO2 at peak load conditions was depicted. NOx and CO2 increase about 7.23% and 25.41%, respectively. Combustion parameters like heat release rate and peak pressure of pine oil mixture exhibited inferior values compared with diesel. Only P20 blend with 10 ml additive exhibited values very close (a drop of 2.8% HRR and 2.4% CP) to that of diesel value. To conclude, out of half-dozen blends when compared with diesel, P20 with 10 ml additive proves as the best blend, providing much capable outcomes. © 2019, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - Off-road vehicles used for construction and agricultural activities are one among the major source of exhaust emission. In order to reduce the environmental impact caused by these vehicles, it is encouraged to use biofuels which are renewable and locally available throughout the year. In the present work, a light biofuel- pine oil was introduced to blend with a methyl ester derived from soapnut oil. This paper details the experimental investigations of the performance, combustion and emission characteristics of an agricultural tractor engine using the combination of biofuels as a complete replacement of conventional diesel fuel. The methyl esters of soapnut oil was blended with pine oil at different proportions. The blends P100SNB0, P75SNB25, P50SNB50, P25SNB75 and P0SNB100 were prepared on volume basis and complied with ASTM D-6751 specifications. The experiments were conducted in a Simpson S217, Twin cylinder tractor diesel engine to study the performance, combustion and emission characteristics of the prepared biofuel. The results showed that the specific fuel consumption of P100SNB0 and biofuel blends decreases up to 4% with the increased engine load. The brake thermal efficiency of the blend P50SNB50 and P75SNB25 were increased by 8% and 10% respectively at full load condition compared with diesel. The biofuel blends outperformed conventional Petro-diesel in terms of smoke, unburnt hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) with a slight penalty on NOx emissions. Up to 50% pine oil blended biodiesel (P75SNB25, P50SNB50) fuel can be used in diesel engines without affecting its performance, emission and combustion characteristics. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative to mineral fuels, with advantages such as biodegradability. However, this makes biodiesel unstable to oxidation. In this way, the use of natural or synthetic antioxidants is necessary. Although many studies have paid attention to the effect of these antioxidants on oxidation stability, not much literature about their effect of them on other properties (before and during storage) was found. The aim of this research study was to characterize biodiesel from corn and sunflower by adding two antioxidants, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), in order to improve its oxidation stability. Moreover, the effect of oxidation on the parameters of biodiesel was studied by using extreme oxidation conditions to accelerate the oxidation process. Both antioxidants improved the oxidation stability of biodiesel, whereas some parameters were altered (viscosity and acid number), which could make this biofuel, if high concentrations of antioxidants are used, unsuitable for commercialization according to standards. © 2019 AOCS

AB  - The main objective of the present paper comprises the investigation of biodiesel production from low-cost feedstock such as lard oil and waste cooking oil (WCO) using Sr–Al double oxides. Nanocatalyst was characterised FTIR, XRD, SEM, TEM, BET and XPS. The Sr:Al with 3:1 M ratio showed the best catalytic activity in the conversion of both oils to fatty acid methyl ester. The effect of acetone and tetrahydrofuran (THF) as a co-solvent for transesterification were compared and the best result was obtained with 5% THF. The mutual effect of the nanocatalyst and co-solvent on biodiesel production was investigated. The characterisation of biodiesel synthesised from lard oil and WCO was performed with GC-MS, 1H and 13C NMR. Moreover, the optimum reaction parameters for transesterification reaction was analysed and the yield was determined by 1H NMR. The maximum yield of 99.7% and 99.4% of lard oil methyl ester and WCO biodiesel were observed with a 0.9 wt% catalyst amount, 1:5.5 oil to methanol ratio in a reaction time of 45 min at 50 °C and 60 °C, respectively. The properties of biodiesel from lard oil and WCO were determined by the EN 14214 method. The regeneration, characterisation and reusability of regenerated catalyst was observed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Wet lipid extraction combined with residual biomass anaerobic digestion are alternatives to reduce the overall energy consumption of biodiesel production from microalgae. Solvents with different polarities have been studied to assess dry and wet lipid extraction process from Isochrysis galbana microalga. Ethyl acetate (EA) and a chloroform:methanol (CM) mixture yielded the best lipid extraction results in the dry and wet route with suitable lipid compositions. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) conversion of dry and wet extracted lipids with these solvents was performed by using both homogeneous (H2SO4) and heterogeneous (resin CT 269) catalysts. FAME production from wet extracted lipids with the EA solvent using the CT-269 resin constitutes an advantageous process because it avoids the water elimination step, and the CT-269 is a heterogeneous commercial catalyst, readily to separate after reaction. Lipid-spent microalga was anaerobically digested, obtaining that waste biomass from the wet extraction with EA had the highest methane yield (310 mL CH4/g volatile solids (VS). Energy balance analysis for FAMEs production with EA solvent (wet route) and heterogeneous catalyst yielded an energy recovery of about 80% in terms of biodiesel and biogas. Therefore, this process constitutes a promising route under an energy-driven microalga biorefinery. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, Turkey's cattle and sheep manure based biomethane potentials are forecasted till 2026. Novel to this study, semi-empirical models based on per capita meat consumption and milk production are used to forecast Turkey's cattle and sheep population. It is estimated that Turkey's cattle and sheep population in 2026 could reach up to 18.7 and 39.2 million, respectively. At these population levels, Turkey's cattle and sheep manure based biomethane generation could reach up to 1.99 billion m3 and 0.15 billion m3, respectively. This is equal to a total of nearly 2.14 billion m3 of biomethane in 2026. This amount of biomethane could provide nearly 6,600 GWh of electricity or supply nearly 2.9% of Turkey's natural gas demand in 2026. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Soot particles, mainly coming from fuel combustion, affect climate forcing through absorbing light and also result in adverse human health outcomes. Though biodiesel or additives blending with diesel was considered environmentally friendly, the understanding on absorbing and oxidative capacity of soot emitted from them are still unclear. The water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) content, surface chemical structure, light absorption and oxidative potential (OPDTT) of soot from biodiesel/diesel and chemicals/diesel blends were investigated utilizing total organic carbon analyzer, X-ray photoelectron spectrometer, ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometry and dithiothreitol (DTT) assay. The differences and correlations between soot properties were statistically analyzed. Chemicals/diesel blends soot owned significantly higher WSOC content, ratio of mass absorbing efficiency (MAE) in 250 and 365 nm (E2/E3), OPDTT, and higher surface carbonyl content. Coconut biodiesel/diesel blends soot contained evidently higher aromatic carbon–oxygen single bond (Ar_C–O) content, and higher MAE365. The individual comparison of biodiesel/diesel blends showed 20% coconut biodiesel blend owned the lowest WSOC, E2/E3 and OPDTT, while highest Ar_C–O and MAE365, representing strongest absorbing properties. Association analysis showed OPDTT was significantly positively correlated with WSOC. Further, the evident negative correlation between MAE365 and OPDTT was observed. Our results showed coconut biodiesel/diesel blends soot induced lower levels of oxidative potential, whereas absorption of light was higher, which have far reaching consequences on climate forcing. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the balance point between light-absorbing properties and oxidative potential, under the wide use of biodiesel. © 2019

AB  - Mounting environmental concerns have given rise to an increasing focus on renewable energies like biofuels. In 2018, three countries – China, the United States, and India – together emitted almost half (50.3%) of the world's CO2 emissions (billion metric tons). The current study aims to forecast biofuels’ production, consumption, and self-sufficiency in these top CO2 emitting countries using a novel grey forecasting model. The study improves on an existing grey forecasting model by optimizing the model architecture (data accumulation operation and background value generation). The proposed forecasting model, EGM (1,1,α,θ), is a generalized form of the even form of the grey forecasting model, and its relative performance turned out to be generally superior to that of the original model. The comparative analyses of the proposed model with two forecasting models revealed that the new model's forecast accuracy is generally better than those of others. The study finds, achieving self-sufficiency in both biofuels (fuel ethanol and biodiesel) would remain a challenge for China, while the United States and India would maintain their self-sufficiency in ethanol and biodiesel, respectively, at least till 2028. The study also argues that biofuel is more likely to be a complementary fuel rather than an alternative fuel. The study helps us understand how, in the next decade, the landscapes of biofuel production and consumption are changing, and concludes with significant policy implications. © 2020

AB  - The acetone–butanol–ethanol (ABE) is considered as a promising biofuel to partially substitute the diesel fuel. In this paper, the optical constant volume combustion chamber was used to record the chamber pressure, and measured the soot mass and distribution for ABE and diesel blends. Then, the CFD KIVA-3V code coupled with the CANTERA was used to simulate the formation and oxidation processes of soot during the spray combustion. In addition, the CFD simulation cases for pure diesel and ABE20 were comprehensively validated against the experimental data under different initial ambient oxygen concentrations. Finally, a series of CFD cases were performed to investigate the effects of different ABE/diesel blends (up to 50% by volume), different initial ambient temperatures (mimic the traditional combustion and low temperature combustion modes) and oxygen concentrations (represent the free, low and high EGR conditions) on the combustion and soot formation characteristics under the diesel engine-relevant conditions. The results indicated that with the increase of ABE ratio in the ABE/diesel blends, the combustion pressure and heat release rate decreased and the combustion phase was delayed, the combustion temperature distribution was more uniform, while the flame lift-off length was increased gradually. In addition, the soot mass was decreased and its corresponding generation rate was also decreased with increasing the ABE ratio in blends. Furthermore, high concentration of soot mainly distributed in the temperature range of 1800–2000 K and the equivalent ratio range of 1.8–2.0. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lipase-catalyzed transesterification for biodiesel production is clean, effective and water tolerance compare with conventional chemical or physical biodiesel synthesis methods. Therefore, in the present research, Burkholderia cepacia lipase was immobilized onto mesoporous silica/iron oxide magnetic core-shell nanoparticles for canola waste cooking oil (WCO) conversion to biodiesel. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) with Central Composite Design (CCD) was used to optimize the transesterification parameters. A quadratic polynomial equation was obtained for biodiesel yield by multiple regression analysis. Desirability function approach gave the optimal transesterification condition as: immobilized lipase concentration of 36%, reaction time of 25 h, methanol to WCO molar ratio of 6.2 and reaction temperature of 34 °C. The predicted biodiesel yield was 92% at the optimal condition. Transesterification catalyzed by the immobilized lipase carried out three times repeatedly, by losing just 11% of lipase activity in the third cycle of the transesterification. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Plastics in many forms have been regarded as one of the most polluting material in the modern world. Therefore, a study has been conducted to check the effectiveness of catalyst-fly ash and zeolite on the production of biofuel from plastics as an attempt to contribute in the reduction of plastic waste pollution to the environment. A lab scale plastic pyrolysis plant has been constructed and feed particle size of 3 ± 1.5 cm2 were used as raw materials. The samples were tested in the pyrolysis plant at about 500 ± 30 °C with and without the presence of catalyst. The catalyst loading ratio of 1:10 catalyst to feed is applied. The result shows that plastic pyrolysis (bottle) without any catalysts have the highest liquid fraction yield with an average yield of 24% while those with catalyst has lower yield (16–22%). Carry bags with zeolite catalyst yield liquid fraction of 22% at a conversion rate of 47%. The inclusion of catalyst has lowered the yield but has produce oil yield of superior quality compared with the samples without catalyst. Engine characteristics study showed that blend fuel D80PO20 (80:20 diesel: plastic pyrolytic oil) have shown similar cylinder pressure during combustion with diesel. Higher brake thermal efficiency and lower brake specific energy consumption were also observed from the engine testing using the blend fuel. The blend fuel has lower hydrocarbon emissions while oxides of nitrogen reduces by 19% and 26% compared to pure diesel and PPO respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biofuels from renewable sources deem itself as a sustainable option for a diesel engine as fuel. In the present study, biodiesel extracted from seeds of sapota through the transesterification method was used along with diesel in one single cylinder, common rail direct injection (CRDi) diesel engine. Also, this research attempt to study the influence of oxygenated additives, injection timing (IT) and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) on different engine characteristics fueled with diesel/biodiesel blends. For this purpose, oxygenates viz., n-butanol (n-B) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) were used as an additive to B40% blend (60% vol. diesel + 40% volume biodiesel). Two test fuels (blends) were prepared by adding 10% by volume of n-butanol and DMC to B40% blend separately. Experimentation was operated at three different injection timings like (21°CA, 23°CA and 25°CA bTDC) and EGR rates (5%, 10%, and 15%) at the engine rated power output. Results reveal that the peak in-cylinder pressures and heat release rate (HRR) let fall slowly as the injection timing was late from 25°CA bTDC to 21°CA bTDC at all the EGR rates. When related to diesel, the combustion incident happened nearer to the top dead center (TDC) when advanced injection timing from 21°CA to 25°CA bTDC. Both oxygenated blends exhibit similar brake thermal efficiency (BTE) among them and a 4.7% decrease in performance was noted against diesel operation. Oxygenated additive to B40% blend elevated the oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emission. Nearly 7% and 60% of reduction in NOx emission were achieved when fuel with an n-butanol blend when related to DMC blend and diesel. About 14%, 10% and 8% lesser smoke opacity than diesel, B40%, and n-butanol blends were achieved with DMC blend injected at 25°CA bTDC and 5% EGR rate. In summary, n-butanol and dimethyl carbonate can be recommended as oxygenated additives when fueled with diesel/biodiesel blend at advanced injection timing and low EGR rates. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The solid waste from papermaking factory, lime mud (LM), was previously demonstrated as an effective catalyst in biomass pyrolysis. Since understanding the kinetics and thermodynamics is the critical step for pyrolysis development, thereby the effect of LM on the kinetics and thermodynamics for biomass pyrolysis was systematically investigated in this study. More specifically, two representative biomasses, herbaceous corncob and woody aspen sawdust, were blended with LM at different mass ratio of 0:0, 0.5:1, 1:1, and 2:1. Based on this, pyrolysis was conducted through thermogravimetry under nitrogen atmosphere. The kinetic parameters of activation energy and pre-exponential factor were calculated by iso-conventional method. While the Avrami theory was used to determine the reaction order. Thermodynamic parameters were also calculated and compared with those of non-catalytic pyrolysis. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Municipal solid waste (MSW), an inexorable by-product of anthropogenic activities composes of nearly 50% of the organic (biogenic) fraction. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) was studied to facilitate thermal depolymerization of organic fraction of MSW to biocrude at sub-critical region of water (200 °C; 100 bar pressure) employing H2 induced reducing conditions. Food, vegetable, and composite wastes were evaluated as feedstocks to produce HTL derivatives in the form of liquor (biocrude and aqueous phase), biochar and bio-gas. The biocrude (HTLOF) showed middle oil as major fraction along with C6-C22 compounds. Composite waste resulted in relatively higher yield of biocrude fraction. The aqueous phase (HTLAF) documented the presence of reducing sugars, sotolon and furfurals as major fraction. Biochar (HTLBC) composition showed maximum carbon fraction followed by hydrogen and oxygen. H2 induced reduced condition facilitated conversion of the biogenic MSW at relatively lower input conditions to various biobased fractions cohesively addressing the basic biorefinery requirement. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pentanol and Hexanol are two excellent biofuels that could be derived from lignocellulosic biomass feedstock without disturbing food-based sources. The present study utilizes these two alcohols as blend constituents with diesel by up to 30% by vol. (designated as Pen30 and Hex30) in a DI diesel engine subject to modifications in injection timing (early and late) and intake air dilution through EGR (up to 30%). The modifications were intended to obtain an optimum performance of the engine. The combustion and performance characteristics of this engine were analyzed with reference to diesel operation. The results indicated that Pen30 blend experienced longer ignition delays, higher peaks of pressure and heat release rates (HRR) than Hex30 at all conditions of EGR. The premixed combustion phasing with the blends were more enhanced followed by numerous HRR spikes during diffusion phasing indicating better combustion. Both the blends delivered better brake thermal efficiencies but with a penalty in fuel consumption. Pen30 delivered better BTE but consumed more than Hex30. NOx emissions of the blends were of the order: Diesel > Pen30 > Hex30. Smoke densities of the blends were of the order: Diesel > Hex30 > Pen30. HC emissions of the blends were of the order: Pen30 > Hex30 > Diesel. CO emissions of the blends followed the trends of smoke emissions. Both these alcohols could be excellent partial substitutes for diesel with minor modifications to the engine subject to long-term tests on durability. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Novel processes for the production of acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) from municipal solid waste (MSW) were developed and simulated using Aspen Plus®. In scenario 1, a conventional distillation system was used, while a gas stripping system was coupled with a fermenter in scenario 2. In scenario 3, pervaporation (PV) and gas stripping systems right after the fermentation reactor were applied. Gas stripping increased the total ABE produced while the addition of the PV module decreased the number of distillation columns from 6 to 2 as well as created 6.4% increments in the amount of butanol in comparison with scenario 1. Economical evaluation resulted in having payout periods of 15.9, 4.4, and 2.9 years for scenarios 1 to 3, respectively. These results show that using MSW as an inexpensive sugar-rich feedstock together with gas stripping PV system is a promising solution to overcome the major obstacles in the way of the ABE production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the ability of Klebsiella pneumoniae DSMZ 2026 to biosynthesize 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD) during batch fermentations when pure glycerol was supplemented with 10 g of unpurified biodiesel-derived glycerol. The crude glycerol (CG) fraction was obtained at laboratory scale from waste cooking oil. Cell viability, biomass, metabolites production, and substrate consumption were investigated. After 12 h of batch cultivation, 18.81 g/L 1,3-PD (yield 0.42 g/g, productivity 1.57 g/L/h) was reached when only pure glycerol was used, having a starting concentration of 43.5 g/L. When 10 g of unfiltered CG was added to the fermentation media that contained pure glycerol, 9.69 g/L 1,3-PD (yield 0.21 g/g, productivity 0.80 g/L/h) was obtained after 12 h. This work underlines the inhibitory potential of unfiltered GC fraction over the 1,3-PD production by K. pneumoniae DSMZ 2026. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Camelina (Camelina sativa) can be used to make biodiesel or biojet fuel. This study compares life-cycle energy, environmental impact and economic performance of making biodiesel versus biojet fuel from camelina oil. The data for camelina field production was obtained from a grower in western Washington, USA. Camelina seeds were crushed, and biodiesel and biojet fuel were produced at the University of Idaho's advanced biofuel research lab. Biodiesel was made via a transesterification reaction, and biojet was made using a technology called hydroprocessed renewable jet fuel. This research found that for a base-case scenario, where transportation and fuel additives were not needed, the ratio of energy in produced biofuel to its life-cycle energy was 3.6 for biodiesel and 1.8 for biojet fuel. Biodiesel reduced life-cycle GHG emissions by 69% compared to conventional diesel. In contrast, camelina biojet reduced GHG emissions by 56.6% compared to jet-A fuel. The cost of ingredients and utilities to make biodiesel was US 75¢/L compared to $2.19/L for biojet fuel taking no credit for byproducts. Considering the potential demand for biodiesel, the price of diesel, and price of jet fuel, it was concluded that biojet fuel is unlikely to compete economically with biodiesel in the foreseeable future. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Bioethanol produced from lignocellulosic materials has been considered as one of the most promising fuels to replace fossil fuels. Immobilized yeasts or bacteria have been frequently used in continuous system due to its feasibility for repeated use with high biomass retention during the continuous process. In this study, continuous SHcF (separate hydrolysis and co-fermentation) and SScF (simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation) were evaluated for ethanol production from alkaline pretreated sugarcane bagasse using Zymomonas mobilis (PVA immobilized cells) and Pichia stipitis (suspended cells). In SHcF fermentation, the ethanol yield and productivity of 0.36 g ethanol/g cellulose (corresponding to 70.65% of theoretical yield) and 1.868 g/L/h were achieved. In contrast, SScF system resulted in an ethanol yield of 0.414 g ethanol/g cellulose (corresponding to 81.17% of theoretical yield) and ethanol productivity of 0.705 g/L/h. The performance of the two systems are compared and discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: During lipase-mediated biodiesel production, by-product glycerol adsorbing on immobilized lipase is a common trouble that hinders enzymatic catalytic activity in biodiesel production process. In this work, we built a hydrophobic pore space in macroporous ZIF-8 (named as M-ZIF-8) to accommodate lipase so that the generated glycerol would be hard to be adsorbed in such hydrophobic environment. The performance of the immobilized lipase in biodiesel production as well as its characteristics for glycerol adsorption were systematically studied. The PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) CVD (chemical vapor deposition) method was utilized to get hydrophobic M-ZIF-8-PDMS with hydrophobic macropore space and then ANL (Aspergillus niger lipase) was immobilized on M-ZIF-8 and M-ZIF-8-PDMS by diffusion into the macropores. Results: ANL@M-ZIF-8-PDMS presented higher enzymatic activity recovery and better biodiesel production catalytic performance compared to ANL@M-ZIF-8. Further study revealed that less glycerol adsorption was observed through the hydrophobic modification, which may attribute to the improved immobilized lipase performance during biodiesel production and ANL@M-ZIF-8-PDMS remained more than 96% activity after five cycles' reuse. Through secondary structure and kinetic parameters' analysis, we found that ANL@M-ZIF-8-PDMS had lower extent of protein aggregation and twice catalytic efficiency (V max/K m) than ANL@M-ZIF-8. Conclusions: Hydrophobic pore space constituted in macroporous ZIF-8 for lipase immobilization greatly improved lipase catalytic performance in biodiesel preparation. The hydrophobic modification time showed negligible influence on the reusability of the immobilized lipase. This work broadened the prospect of immobilization of enzyme on MOFs with some inspiration. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Waste vegetable oil is generated from different sources, such as domestic, commercial and industrial activities, and it requires proper management. Due to the increase in the generation of waste vegetable oil, concern for its management has intensified. The most common management option for waste vegetable oil is the conversion into biodiesel, which improves the chemical-physical characteristics of raw waste vegetable oil for its use but is characterized by significant energy consumption and environmental impact. Therefore, straight waste vegetable oil as fuel, after mechanical pre-treatments and with suitable operational strategy, is suggested in the available literature. In this work, waste vegetable oil from the separate collection is proposed as a source to fuel a combined heat and power unit producing energy for wastewater and sludge treatment plants, which is high energy-demanding. The operation of the combined heat and power unit is analyzed considering data from an experimental campaign carried out to investigate the performance of internal combustion engines powered by waste vegetable oil. Such experimental data are used to carry out the feasibility analysis of a combined heat and power system for an actual wastewater treatment plant located in the Campania region, southern Italy. The system appears to be economically feasible with a simple payback around 3.44 years, a net present value higher than 19.0 M€ and an interest rate of return of 26.7%. Moreover, it produces 70.0% less equivalent carbon dioxide emissions, with respect to a similar system powered by fossil fuels. Therefore, waste vegetable oil as a locally available and renewable energy source may contribute to realize smart and resilient communities, since it improves securing domestic energy supply and waste valorization. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A novel multifunctional catalytic system, Ni2P/Zr-SBA-15, was synthesized by H2 temperature-programmed reduction of nickel phosphate precursors impregnated in Zr-SBA-15. Zr-SBA-15 was prepared by hydrothermal crystallization. The properties of catalysts for the hydrodeoxygenation of Jatropha Oil were evaluated by a one-step hydrogenation process in a high-pressure reactor. The best preparation parameters were determined. The multifunction of the catalyst includes excellent deoxidation, aromatization and cracking properties. It is worth noting that this product contains higher concentration aviation fuel components, with amount of C8–C16 accounting for more than 60 wt% of the product oil. The content of paraffin hydrocarbons is 79.25 wt%, aromatic compounds accounting for 10.13 wt% (all consisting of monocyclic aromatics), naphthene accounting for 6.72 wt%. The oil density is 811–828 kg/m3. These physical and chemical properties of C8–C16 are consistent with the detailed requirements for aviation turbine fuels containing synthetic hydrocarbons, as specified in ASTM-D7566-2017b. In this study, the aromatic content and density of nonblended bio-based jet fuels were satisfied with criteria and achieved the one-step hydrogenation process for the preparation of higher quality of bio-jet fuel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Levulinic acid (LA) is a promising renewable platform compound derived from biomass for the manufacture of various valuable chemicals, among which levulinate esters have been demonstrated to be good fuel additives. Many previous studies have focused on the production of short-chain levulinates for biofuels such as methyl and ethyl levulinates, but these esters suffer from some essential issues including a high oxygen content, low energy density (or heating value) and water solubility. Long-chain levulinate esters have similar structures to biodiesel. The long carbon chain may provide a higher carbon content and strong hydrophobicity, therefore improving the energy density and water insolubility. In this work, the synthesis of a long-chain levulinate ester, n-hexyl levulinate (HL), has been fast and efficiently achieved by the catalytic esterification of LA and 1-hexanol at low temperature. Tungsten hexachloride (WCl6) showed the most superior activity among the tested metal salt catalysts under mild conditions. A HL yield of ∼85% with almost complete LA conversion could be obtained at 50 °C after only 30 min. Other hexanols that have larger steric hindrances, such as 2-ethyl-1-butanol, 2-hexanol, 3-hexanol and cyclohexanol, could also promote efficient esterification with LA over the WCl6 catalyst, resulting in excellent product yields of ∼82-91%. The strategy applies to the efficient synthesis of longer chain levulinate esters such as n-octyl levulinate (OL) as well. The WCl6 catalyst was reusable several times in a consecutive batch reaction mode. The method reported herein offers a strategy for the efficient production of liquid fuels from LA, potentially bridging raw biomass feedstocks and terminal utilization of biobased products. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - This work investigates the effects of addition of syngas and biodiesel on a reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI) engine fuelled with diesel. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of exhaust particulate matter has been done to obtain particulate matter (PM) morphology. Energy and exergy analyses have been performed to observe energy and availability shares, and to provide directions for the energy recovery systems. Closed cycle combustion simulations have been performed to complement the experimental results and for an improved understanding of in-cylinder dynamics. Chemical and physical properties of three biodiesel samples have been analysed using elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Based on the initial study, used cooking oil based biodiesel blend (B20, 20% biodiesel) has been chosen in experiments. The optimal operating conditions for syngas/diesel and syngas/B20 in RCCI mode for different operating parameters have been investigated. Injection pressure, injection timing and pre-injection mass ratio have been modified to get improved combustion efficiency at mid-load. Syngas/diesel mode with an injection timing of 19° before top dead centre (bTDC) shows slightly higher brake thermal efficiency (BTE) with 22% and 77% lower oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and PM respectively as compared to conventional diesel combustion. In syngas/B20 mode, a maximum BTE of 24% has been observed for the case with a pre-injection at 50° bTDC with 30% mass fraction and 18° bTDC main injection timing. Syngas/diesel shows a reduction in primary soot particle count by about 67% and contains larger aggregates as compared to neat diesel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

Diesel emissions have a significant impact on the atmosphere, contributing to air pollution, smog and global warming. As a result, diesel exhaust is dangerous to human health. While emissions reduction efforts have often focused on changing engine design or improving aftertreatment, diesel fuel modifications can also play an important role in improving engine efficiency and reducing exhaust emissions. The aim of this work was to examine the potential for emissions reductions under real-world conditions when employing fuel additives. Three different additives were examined, consisting of hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) and two commercial additives containing nanoparticles of cerium dioxide and ferrocene. HVO was selected as a renewable fuel, an alternative to commonly used biodiesels with competitive advantages. The new European driving cycle (NEDC) procedure was used to measure emissions of regulated compounds: carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and particulates (by mass and number) from an 11-year-old passenger car equipped with a diesel engine powered by fuel blends. The fuel blends prepared met the quality requirements for diesel fuel. The results obtained confirm that the application of both HVO and nano-additives to diesel can achieve a significant reduction of carbon monoxide (52%) and hydrocarbon (47%) emissions compared to the B7 base fuel. Particulate emissions (up to 10% by mass of particulates and 7% by number of particulates) were found to be best reduced by adding nanoparticles of cerium dioxide to the B7 fuel (with 30% HVO), while the best results in reducing nitrogen oxide emissions were obtained by adding ferrocene nanoparticles to the B7 fuel with 30% HVO. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present work investigates the influence of advanced injection strategy on a common rail direct injection assisted diesel engine characteristics fuelled with biodiesel and conventional diesel. Also, an artificial neural network is employed to forecast engine characteristics. Engine test is conducted under 100% load condition through an optimized nozzle opening pressure of 500 bar. Pre-injection timing is fixed permanently at 30 °CA bTDC, main injection timing varied from 15 °CA to 21 °CA bTDC and post-injection varied from 6 °CA bTDC to 6 °CA aTDC sequentially. However, the pre, main and post-injection quantities are changed respectively from 5% to 15%, 70% to 90%, and 5% to 15%. Minimum carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbon and smoke emission of 0.01% vol., 8 ppm and 1.59 FSN are achieved with pre-injection timing of 30 °CA, main injection timing of 21 °CA bTDC, and post injection timing of 6 °CA bTDC for B100-15%-70%-15%. Maximum brake thermal efficiency and nitric oxide emission of 34.3% and 1114 ppm are achieved in B100-5%-90%-5% at advanced injection timing and higher nozzle opening pressure. Artificial neural network models conform to experimental results having a lower root mean square error and correlation coefficient values in a range of 0.01 to 0.02 and 0.980 to 0.998 respectively. An artificial neural network is mostly preferred over other theoretical and empirical models to higher accuracy in predicting the output. Hence, multiple injection strategy fuelled biodiesel significantly decreased the emission and improved the performance compared to mechanical, single and split injection strategy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The increase of nitrogen content caused by the re-polymerization of nitrogenous compounds remains an important challenge during aqueous phase recirculation in the water solvent. In this work, aqueous phase recirculation was conducted in the ethanol-water solvent to evaluate the feasibility of ethanol addition in inhabiting the re-polymerization of nitrogenous compounds. The present study provides a comprehensive comparison of yield and quality between bio-oils derived from aqueous phase recirculation in the water solvent and ethanol-water solvent. The results showed that the addition of ethanol in aqueous phase recirculation displayed higher promotion in bio-oil yield (7%) compared with water solvent (3.55%). The energy recovery efficiency of bio-oil from ethanol-water solvent reached 87.43% after recirculation for three times, while that from the water solvent was 74.61%. The elemental analysis and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis indicated that ethanol addition could inhibit the re-polymerization of nitrogenous compounds and thus decrease the nitrogen content in bio-oil. This resulted in lower NO and HCN emission peaks during the combustion process. Besides, the addition of ethanol increased the content of light molecular weight fractions and decreased the coke formation, which contributed to complete combustion and resulted in lower CO emission peaks. Overall, this work provides a feasible way for further improving the bio-oil yield and fuel quality through ethanol addition in solvent during aqueous phase recirculation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study presents an extensive and detailed characterization of products from hydropyrolysis and anaerobic digestion and proposes a multi-pathway assessment of algal biomass conversion. An algal biorefinery based on sequential hydropyrolysis (HyPy) and anaerobic digestion (AD) of algal biofilm has been comprehensively studied for the first time. Wet and untreated biomass from algal biofilm was directly employed as feedstock for the HyPy-AD coupled process and the products obtained were characterized by GC-MS, LC-MS, HPLC, CHNS, SEM and TEM. Based on different morphological and structural characterizations, different biorefinery routes were assessed in terms of net energy recovery and ecological impact. Upto 42% biocrude yield and 200 mL gVS-1 biomethane yield with a net energy ratio (NER) of 1.5 were observed for the coupled process of HyPy and AD, giving it a cutting edge over other conversion routes. A biorefinery based on these results has been presented considering a sustainable approach to valorize whole algal biomass towards multiple product recovery. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The present work explores the potential to upgrade waste cooking oil (WCO) via deoxygenation using inexpensive, unsupported metal oxide catalysts (CaO, TiO2, Mn(IV)O, and ZnO) in the absence of a hydrogen feedstock. WCO was mixed with 5 wt% catalyst material in a stainless steel reactor and heated to 300 °C for 60 min. The relative concentration of fatty acids increased upon heating in the absence of any catalyst, from ~15% of the total identifiable compounds for WCO to 64% for the Organic Liquid Products as a result of the nearly complete conversion of aldehyde and ester groups to organic acids, alkanes and aromatics. The inorganic catalysts shifted the product distributions significantly. CaO and ZnO slightly increased the concentration of acidic groups (versus WCO) but produced less acids than OLP alone, while Mn(IV)O and TiO2 resulted in overall decreases of free fatty acids. Mn(IV)O showed a slight preference for alkene formation, whereas TiO2 was selective toward alkanes. All catalysts – and uncatalyzed heating – showed significant deoxygenation in terms of ridding the WCO of C-O groups. Thermal treatment of WCO (with and without catalysts) resulted in a 25% increase in higher heating values, in line with those of commercial jet fuels. While the “one-pot” catalytic upgrading of WCO would not result in a direct substitute for aviation fuel, this work demonstrated the potential to significantly upgrade WCO using an inexpensive catalyst without relying on copious amounts of hydrogen gas to affect a hydrodeoxygenation reaction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bimetallic Mo-Ni was successfully impregnated on acidic mesoporous alumino-silicates supports. The acidic mesoporous alumino-silicates for instance, SBA-15, MAS, KIT-6, FSM-16 having Si/Al ratio = 10 were synthesized by post-grafting method. The effect of different mesoporous supports and active metals have been investigated through various characterization methods viz. XRD, H2-TPR, NH3-TPD, Raman, DR UV–Vis spectra, XPS spectra, TGA and SEM with EDAX and GPC results. The catalytic activity of present system is discussed in detail and compared with the previously reported studies. The prepared materials were analysed in a high-pressure reactor for HDO of non-edible oils (jatropha and watermelon oils) to biofuel productions by changing a number of reaction parameters for instance, reaction temperature (300 °C–375 °C), H2 pressure (10–40 bar), WHSV (0.5–2.0 h−1), and in addition Time on Stream (TOS). The nature of mesoporous supports and interaction between Mo-Ni active metals and acid supports were also investigated. This study demonstrates that Mo-Ni/MAS (10) catalyst have been successfully produced green fuel from non-edible oils (jatropha and watermelon oil) through the HDO pathway at 350 °C, WHSV 1.0 h−1, and 30 bar H2 pressure. The Mo-Ni/MAS (10) catalyst possesses unique surface properties such as high surface area 670 m2 g−1, average pore diameter 4.3 nm, pore volume 0.81 cm3 g−1, total acidity 2.07 mmol g−1, and considerable number of active sites 4.20 μmol g−1. The specific reaction rates, as well as turn over frequency for Mo-Ni/MAS (10) catalyst, were found to be 4.31 × 10−4 g s mol−1 and 10.5 s−1, which are considerably high. It has also been established that the reaction is unaffected by means of any resistance to mass transfer. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Ethanolysis carried out under Lewis-Brønsted acid catalysis was investigated as a possible process to valorize the organic fraction of urban sewage sludge, with the aim of selectively obtaining liquid biofuels. In a single reactive step, the conversion of lipids into fatty acid ethyl esters, of carbohydrates into ethyl levulinate, furanic compounds and ethyl glycosides and of proteins into ethyl ester of amino acids was achieved. The optimization of reactive conditions was conducted using pure chemicals as model compounds. The effect of the co-presence of water was also considered. Then, real samples of sewage sludge (as dried and wet centrifuged samples) were reacted in ethanol in the presence of the appropriate combination of homogeneous Lewis-Brønsted acid catalysts, namely 1 %wt aluminium chloride hexahydrate and sulfuric acid respect to ethanol. After 6 h at 453 K, 99% of lipids and almost 60% of initial complex sugars were effectively converted into the abovementioned target products. Conversions and yields were quite similar to those obtained by reacting pure compounds singularly, confirming the robustness of the process and its applicability to differently composed sludge. At the end of the reaction, products were easily recovered and purified from the alcoholic phase, whereas only a very limited amount of solids remain as inert materials. Final refined biofuels have high calorific values (37 and 40 MJ kg−1) and actually represent the 68.5 and 59.2% of the initial energy content of starting sludge, respectively. This strategy combines valorization of the starting organic fraction of sewage sludge and a considerable reduction of final solid waste (in a stabilised form) to be disposed of. Finally, through a preliminary feasibility study, this acid ethanolysis resulted in a competitive alternative to the anaerobic digestion of mixed sewage sludge to obtain biofuels. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Mixed, wet, plastic streams containing food waste residues are being increasingly collected at point of use, but are extremely challenging to recycle and are therefore largely sent to landfill. While a challenging waste problem, this also represents an underutilised feedstock, which could be co-processed with biomass, increasing the scope of products, easing out seasonal variation in biomass production and increasing the production capacity of a traditional biorefinery. One promising method of biomass conversion is hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), where lignocellulosic residues are broken down in water at high temperatures and pressures to produce a bio-crude oil, a solid residue and an aqueous fertiliser. In this study, the co-processing of common plastic waste with pistachio hulls was assessed to investigate the suitability of the HTL approach. The HTL of pistachio hulls was undertaken at 350 °C over 15 and 60 min, with four commonly used plastics: polyethylene, polypropylene, PET and nylon-6, in blends of up to 20 wt% plastic to biomass. A novel FT-IR method was developed to estimate the conversion of plastics in the system, and the product phases were fully analysed. High yields of up to 35% bio-crude were achieved, and under optimal conditions, nylon-6 and PET were found to break down almost completely in the system. PET generated numerous products that distributed predominantly into the aqueous phase; the major decomposition product of nylon-6 was found to be the monomer ∊-caprolactam, also largely partitioning into the aqueous phase. The polyolefins were less reactive; a limited degree of decomposition formed oxidised products, which distributed into the bio-crude phase. This result represents a highly promising method for waste plastic valorisation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the effect of additives in Jet-A fuel blends, especially on performance, combustion and emission characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: Jet-A fuel was formed by using Kay’s and Gruenberg–Nissan mixing rules by adding additive glycerol with TiO2. While measuring the combustion performance, the amount of oxygen content present in fuel and atomization are the key factors to consider. As such, the Jet-A fuel was created by adding additives at different proportion. A small gas turbine engine was used for conducting tests. All tests were carried out at different load conditions for all the fuel blends such as neat Jet-A fuel, G10T (glycerol 10% with 50 ppm TiO2 and Jet-A 90%), G20T (glycerol 10% with 50 ppm TiO2 and Jet-A 90%) and G30T (glycerol 10% with 50 ppm TiO2 and Jet-A 90%). Findings: From tests, the G20T and G10T produced better results than other blends. The thermal efficiency of the blends of G20T and G10T are 22% and 14% higher than neat Jet-A fuel. Further, the improved static thrust with less fuel consumption was noticed in G20T fuel blend. Originality/value: The G20T blends showed better performance because of the increased oxygenated compounds in the fuel blends. Moreover, the emission rate of environmentally harmful gases such as NOx, CO and HC was lower than the neat Jet-A fuel. From the results, it is clear that the rate of exergy destruction is more in the combustion chamber than the other components of fuel. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Microwave heating technology has attracted great attention in biorefineries to generate biofuels and biomass-derived chemicals. NaOH and H2SO4 pretreatments are often applied to improve the process efficiency. Traditional heating pretreatments require long reaction times and contribute to rapid sugar degradation. Although effective, H2SO4 pretreatment suffers from the disadvantages of equipment corrosion, inhibitors generation, and waste water production. Herein, we performed NaOH, H2SO4, and FeCl3 pretreatments on sugar cane bagasse under microwave heating, and compared their effects on the biomass physical features, chemical compositions, and sugar release during pretreatment process. Our results showed that high amounts of sugar were obtained, and xylose and glucose were selectively recovered in the pretreatment liquor within 5–10 min of microwave heating by changing pretreatment media. NaOH efficiently fractionated biomass, generated xylose as the major product in pretreatment liquor, and left the solid residue more digestible. H2SO4 and FeCl3 effectively degraded both the hemicellulose and cellulose, producing glucose as the major product in the pretreatment liquor. Compared with H2SO4, FeCl3 pretreatment more efficiently removed lignin and recovered 48% glucose within only 5 min. Biomass chemical composition and morphological characteristics were studied and compared, confirming that microwave assisted FeCl3 pretreatment is a new and feasible approach to replace H2SO4 for biofuel and biomass-derived chemicals production. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This research presents an approach for using waste cooking oil as a substrate for the production of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) by Bacillus thermoamylovorans. In addition, PHA was utilised as a feedstock for a biofuel, namely 3-hydroxyalkanoate methyl ester (3HAME). The largest amount of biomass (4.0 ± 0.1 g/L) and the greatest production of PHA [3.5 ± 0.1 g/L, corresponding to 87.5% of cell dry mass (CDM)] were obtained under optimal conditions, with 4% (w/v) waste cooking oil (WCO) used as a carbon source at 45 °C and 150 rpm for 48 h under batch cultivation. The isolated polymer was identified as poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) [P(3HB-co-3HV)] with 85 mol% of 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) and 15 mol% of 3-hydroxyvalerate (3HV) using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Notably, the properties of the copolymer were similar to the properties of the commercial P(3HB-co-3HV). Moreover, P(3HB-co-3HV) was used as a feedstock for the biofuel. P(3HB-co-3HV) methyl ester, a biofuel, was obtained under optimal conditions, with methanol and 15% (v/v) H2SO4 under a reaction temperature of 65 °C and time of 60 h. The highest yield of 3HAME that was obtained was 74.4%, with 97% methyl ester content. Almost all of the properties of 3HAME pass ASTM and Thailand’s fuel standards. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - European legislation and new engine technologies require better quality in fuels, and the diesel scandal pushes engine and fuel developers to investigate new solutions. The decrease of fossil energy sources and the new, stricter emission regulations necessitate the discovery of renewable sources. Biofuels are an obvious solution to replace fossil fuels in a more environmentally conscious way. This study presents a new approach with the analytical investigation of butanol, hydrogenated vegetable oil, and diesel oil blends. In the presented phase of the research, our focus was on the most application-critical chemical properties of the fuels, to analyze if the three component blends are suitable for compression ignition engines. A wide-ranging chemical-analytical test plan was prepared with nearly 20 parameters measured of the chemical and physical parameters of blends, especially regarding flash point, cetane number, viscosity and cold filter plugging point (CFPP). The findings prove that from an engine-critical characteristics point of view butanol – hydrogenated vegetable oil – diesel blends are a potential solution, as HVO and butanol counterbalance its critical parameters. © 2020, Budapest University of Technology and Economics.

AB  - Fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) can potentially be used as biodiesel, which provides a renewable alternative to petroleum-derived diesel. FAEEs are primarily produced via transesterification of vegetable oil with an alcohol catalyzed by a strong base, which raises safety concerns. Microbial production presents a more environmentally sustainable method for FAEE production, and by harnessing the ability of oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica to degrade and assimilate hydrophobic substrates, FAEE production could be coupled to food waste bioremediation. In this study, we engineered Y. lipolytica to produce FAEEs from dextrose as well as from vegetable cooking oil as a model food waste. Firstly, we introduced pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) and alcohol dehydrogenase II (adhB) from Zymomonas mobilis to reconstitute the heterologous pathway for ethanol production. Second, we introduced and compared two heterologous wax ester synthases ws2 and maqu_0168 from Marinobacter sp. for FAEE biosynthesis. Next, we disrupted competitive pathways to increase fatty acyl-CoA pool, and optimized carbon sources and cell density for shake-flask fermentation. The engineered strain showed a 24-fold improvement in FAEE production titer over the starting strain. Moreover, we explored the potential of the engineered strain for FAEE production from the model food waste by supplementing vegetable cooking oil to the culture medium. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on FAEE production with the supplementation of vegetable cooking oil in Y. lipolytica. These findings provide valuable insights into the engineering of Y. lipolytica for high-level production of FAEEs and its utilization in food waste bioremediation. © 2019 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan

AB  - A study was conducted for fuel characterization of a stable nano-oxide added water emulsified biodiesel blend (NWEB) prepared with optimal emulsifying parameters. NWEB prepared with Hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) value 5.0 indicated the least separation from emulsion layer as compared to other HLB values 4.3 and 6.0. Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy was conducted in Mid-IR range to ensure the quality of biodiesel and emulsified fuel. The stability data of NWEB prepared with varying the emulsifying parameters were used in radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) for simulation of actual and predicted separation from emulsion. The well trained RBFNN model was coupled with particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique to find the optimal emulsifying parameters to produce a stable NWEB. The predicted optimal emulsifying parameters were found as 69.7 ppm nano-oxide concentration, 10% water, 1% surfactant and 2500 rpm of stirrer for a predicted separation of 0.90% after 30 h of emulsification against actual separation of 0.84%. The fuel properties of NWEB and base fuels were determined following the standard procedures. These properties were found within the limits of American, European and Indian Standards for diesel, biodiesel and biodiesel blends and thus indicating the suitability of these fuels in diesel engine. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The ever increasing demand from the industry and transport sector has led to an increased requirement of diesel and other oil products. These fuels belong to the non-renewable resources, their continuous availability is uncertain for the future. These factors along with the political instability causes fluctuating prices and supply of diesel. These have an impact on developing countries like India which met majority of demand from the import. Different researchers have been working to find out bio-fuels to substitute for diesel in compression ignition engines. Several fuels like liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Biodiesel, Alcohols and compressed natural gas (CNG) are substituted these days by different automobiles. Tyre pyrolytic oil is obtained by the pyrolysis of waste tyres. Tyre pyrolytic oil is blended with mineral diesel in different proportions viz. 50, 40, 30, 20 and 10 per cent by volume. The characterization of fuel samples are done by standard methods. The performance characteristics are studied by conducting test on common rail direct injection (CRDI) test rig. Experiments were carried out to assess the performance characteristics of a CRDI diesel engine working with blends of tyre pyrolytic oil (TPO) with diesel fuel (DF) consisting of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 per cent of tire oil. Pyrolysis is a technical solution to handle the issue of safe disposal of used tyres. From the results it can be concluded that the brake thermal efficiency of the engine working with TPO-DF blends increases with change in blend concentration and always higher than diesel fuel. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Renewable lignocellulosic biomass is a promising energy resource since its co-pyrolysis with hydrogen-rich plastics can produce high-yield and high-quality bio-oil. In this study, co-pyrolysis of agricultural wastes (i.e. corn stover) and wood wastes (i.e. narra, Pterocarpus indicus and ipil, Intsia bijuga) with polyolefin plastics (i.e. polypropylene, low-density polyethylene, and high-density polyethylene) were examined via thermogravimetric analyses. Unlike previous co-pyrolysis studies which had focused on the improvement of product yield or cumulative weight loss, herein, we present the synergistic effects on the mass decomposition rate or rate of generation of products during co-pyrolysis. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of temperature, and biomass-to-plastic ratio on rate synergy during co-pyrolysis. Rate synergy values up to 10% per min were obtained for biomass and plastic blends. Activation energy and pre-exponential factor of the reactions in the co-pyrolysis process were evaluated using the Coats-Redfern method. Activation energies for agricultural waste and plastics blends ranged from 45 to 82 kJ mol−1 while that for wood wastes and plastic blends ranged from 53 to 112 kJ mol−1. Interestingly, the activation energy of the thermal decomposition of plastic was found to be lower during co-pyrolysis with biomass than in pure form. Moreover, biomass-plastic co-pyrolysis followed a two-stage degradation: biomass degradation from 200 to 400 °C and thereafter plastic degradation from 400 to 500 °C. Overall, the use of lignocellulosic biomass and waste plastics for biofuel production can also minimize the volume of solid wastes for landfills. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Photocatalysis has offered a promising opportunity for selective transformation of biomass to high-value chemicals or fuels under mild conditions. Whereas titanium oxide has been widely used for photocatalytic pollutant degradation, H2 evolution, and CO2 reduction, few studies have been devoted to TiO2-based photocatalytic valorization of biomass or biomass-derived platform compounds. Here, we report on surface-controlled photocatalysis of TiO2 for selective valorization of furfurals and vanillin that are lignocellulose-derived key platform compounds. The reaction can be switched from hydrogenation of aldehyde group to C–C coupling by manipulating exposed facets; furanic and aromatic alcohols or coupling products, which are fine chemicals or jet-fuel precursors, could be produced with high selectivity. Our studies elucidate that the facet-dependent density of oxygen vacancies governs the charge distribution and adsorption strength of surface species and thus controls product selectivity. The present work offers an example of selectivity control by engineering TiO2 surfaces for valorization of biomass-derived feedstocks. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.
Photocatalysis has emerged as a useful approach to the sustainable production of value-added products from biomass, in which selectivity is the key issue because a number of transformations are possible when multifunctional biochemicals are the reactants. As one of the most popular photocatalysts, TiO2 has mainly been applied to reactions like pollutant degradation that concern more about activity than selectivity. The knowledge about selectivity-controlling principles for TiO2 is limited. Here, we report the first illustration of TiO2-based photocatalysis that succeeds in modulating product selectivity in bioplatform transformations. Fine chemicals or jet-fuel precursors have been produced in high yields by controlling the density of oxygen vacancies on TiO2, which governs surface adsorption and reaction and thus determines the product selectivity. This work offers useful insights into the design of selective photocatalysts for biomass valorization by surface engineering. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.
Wang and colleagues found that the selectivity for photocatalytic transformations of lignocellulose-derived platform chemicals including furfural, methyl furfural, and vanillin depended strongly on the exposed facet of TiO2. They demonstrated that the facet-dependent density of oxygen vacancies governs the charge distribution and adsorption strength of surface species, and thus determines product selectivity. Hydrogenation products such as fine chemicals and coupling products as biofuel precursors can be produced in high yields over oxygen-vacancy-rich and oxygen-vacancy-free TiO2 surfaces, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Lemon Peel Oil is a clean and sustainable biofuel that has shown promising results under varying driving conditions. Growing vehicle density globally makes road congestions a common sight where the engines operate under idling conditions accounting for massive fuel wastage and severe emissions. However, considering the frequent occurrence of idling and the damage caused by it, the need to calibrate engines to utilise Lemon Peel Oil under idling conditions for addressing the issues of fuel shortage and pollution is observed. Hence, this work utilises a systematic experimental approach to analyse the potential of a 20% (vol/vol) blend of Lemon Peel Oil in diesel and compares it with conventional diesel for idling conditions. The systematic experimentation is determined using the Response Surface Methodology coupled with Central Composite Design on a Common Rail Direct Injection Engine Setup. The potential of the biofuel blend is analysed by mathematical modelling of various tests conducted. At optimal idling calibrations, 42.1% drop in smoke emissions and 16% reduction in Carbon Monoxide with an increase of 5.25% in Carbon Dioxide is reported. The slightly reduced heating value of the fuel caused a 10.18% reduction in thermal efficiency and a 21.24% increase in Specific Fuel Consumption. The 2.43% increase in peak pressure and the 4.6% increase in Heat Release Rate further suggests this biofuel blend possesses superior combustion characteristics and is a cleaner fuel. Hence, the potential of Lemon Peel Oil with optimized engine parameters is determined for the idling condition. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The main challenge of utilizing ethanol in diesel engines in blending mode is the phase separation issue. Therefore, an attempt has been performed to enhance the stability feature of ethanol/Jatropha biodiesel (JME) blends by using n-butanol as co-solvent. The 10% by volume of n-butanol is added to the mixtures of 10% and 20% ethanol and 70% and 80% JME, which is denoted as JME10Bu10E and JME10Bu20E, respectively. The phase stability of the evaluated fuels is examined employing visual approach and Thermogravimetric analysis. These methods confirm that there is no phase separation for more than 2 months under ambient conditions. Then, the combustion and emission features are investigated utilizing a diesel engine run with different loads and constant speed. The findings demonstrate that the pmax. and HRR are increased by adding ethanol. The ignition delay is extended with the addition of ethanol while the combustion period is almost the same. The bsfc is decreased by adding ethanol compared to JME fuel. The CO, UHC, and NOx formations are reduced markedly by 40%, 40%, and 40%, respectively, with adding ethanol. Finally, using n-butanol and JME as co-solvents with ethanol supports the growth of renewable energy in the CI engine. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This paper discusses the performance, exhaust emissions and combustion of a diesel generator fueled with two different biodiesels, and their blends. In the experiments, animal fat biodiesel (AFB) obtained from beef bone marrow, vegetable oil biodiesel (VOB) derived from safflower/canola oil mixture, and ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD) were used as pure. In addition, 50% by volume of AFB was mixed with ULSD (AFB50), and 50% by volume of VOB was mixed with ULSD (VOB50). All engine tests were conducted at a constant engine speed of 1500 rpm for three different diesel generator loads (3.6, 7.2, and 10.8 kW). According to the results, when the AFB and its blend were used as fuel in a diesel generator, it was determined that cylinder gas pressure (CP) and net heat release rate (HRR) values were higher, and raised earlier in all loads compared with VOB and ULSD. Moreover, the values of mean gas temperature (MGT) and exhaust gas temperature (EGT) were increased with the use of AFB compared to other test fuels, whereas thermal efficiency (TE), carbon monoxide (CO) and hydro carbon (HC) emission decreased in general. The carbon dioxide (CO2) emission was also higher than ULSD, but remained lower than VOB. The nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission was found to show a similar change in all types of fuel. © 2020

AB  - This study was designed to assess the synergistic effects of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations on oil content, fatty acid profile, and predicted fuel properties of Dunaliella salina. Axenic D. salina cells were grown in F/2 growth medium of salinity 34 ppt containing 33.6 g.l−1 ultramarine synthetic sea salt. Growth dry weight, cell count, and their relationship were measured, and oils were extracted by soaking following Soxhlet extraction. Growth dry weight was markedly affected by N and P concentrations, with maximum growth dry weights of cultures grown at recommended N and P concentrations (control), half of the recommended N concentration (0.5 N) and (0.5 N/0.5P) being 0.911 g.l−1, 0.755 g.l−1, and 0.615 g.l−1, respectively. Oil content showed the reverse pattern, with cultures grown in the absence of phosphorus (0.0P), full N/P starvation (0.0 N/0.0P), and control resulting in maximum oil contents of 24.86%, 22.85%, and 5.88%, respectively. The majority of fatty acid methyl esters ranged between C14 and C22. Estimated fuel properties of algal cells grown under NP stress conditions were found to meet the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and European Committee for Standardization (EN) guidelines. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The present research investigates potential of microalgae isolated from sewage treatment plant to utilize sodium bicarbonate as carbon source for CO2 sequestration and biodiesel production. Eight algal isolates were isolated from waste water of sewage treatment plant, Amity University Haryana, India. The most potent algal isolates were identified and characterized on the basis of growth and lipid content. The efficient isolates ASW1 and ASW2 were identified as Chlorella sp. and Arthronema sp. by 18srRNA and 16srRNA sequencing method. In both isolates, maximum growth was observed under 20-W fluorescent bulb (3500 flux light intensity) with continuous light cycle of 24 h at pH 9.0 and 25 °C on the 20th day of incubation period. CO2 utilization efficiency of both algal isolates were observed in terms of total CO2 consumption rate. Under optimized culture conditions, total lipid content and lipid yield was higher in Arthronema sp. (180 mg l−1; 32.14%) as compared to Chlorella sp. (98 mg l−1; 29.6%) in 50 mM NaHCO3. Transesterified lipids were analysed by GC-MS. The fatty acid methyl ester profile of Arthronema sp. was 34.42% saturated and 65.58% unsaturated fatty acid. Chlorella sp. produces 29.80% saturated and 70.20% unsaturated fatty acid. In both isolates, C16 and C18 fatty acids dominated, which is a promising component for biodiesel.

AB  - Glycerol is the main by-products obtained from the transesterification of vegetable oils and animal fats to produce biodiesel which is an important biofuel used for transportation. The increase in the global energy demand has pushed up the production of biodiesel with a corresponding increase in glycerol production over the years. The thermo-catalytic process is gaining wide popularity as sustainable technical routes of converting glycerol to renewable hydrogen. There exists a great potential of utilizing hydrogen as a critical part of a more sustainable and secure energy mix. Hence, this study focusses on the review of the recent advances and development in the thermo-catalytic conversion of glycerol to renewable hydrogen in the last one decade. The analysis of the reviewed articles showed that substantial efforts had been made in the application of thermo-catalytic process for the conversion of glycerol to renewable hydrogen. Glycerol reforming using steam, carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen (O2) have received significant research attention and have been found to have great potential as technological routes for hydrogen production. Whereas, the use of the photocatalytic glycerol reforming has the advantages of energy-saving by utilizing the vast available solar resources and suitable photocatalysts. However, each of the thermo-catalytic processes exhibits inherent challenges which have been a bottleneck to the development of the process to industrial scales. Nevertheless, the prospect of employing each of the thermo-catalytic processes for hydrogen production via glycerol conversion was identified with the possible suggestion of strategies of overcoming the challenges. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - The combination of distinctive physicochemical properties of biofuels and recent engine technologies offer benefits in terms of efficiency improvement and emissions reduction. The recent development in butanol bio-based production pathways encourage researchers to study their combustion characteristics. This paper experimentally evaluates the combustion and emissions of a gasoline direct injection (GDI) engine fueled with the butanol isomer/gasoline surrogate blends, in which primary reference fuel (PRF) and toluene primary reference fuel (TPRF) are selected as the gasoline surrogates, respectively. The flame propagation behaviors, in-cylinder pressure, apparent heat release rate, along with PN emissions from this optical GDI engine are discussed. First, butanol addition to the gasoline surrogates is found to slow down flame propagation, reduce peak cylinder pressure and heat release rate, and extend ignition delay and combustion duration. Further, among the four butanol isomers, n-butanol and tert-butanol are the most and least reactive fuels, respectively, whereas iso-butanol and sec-butanol show reactivities in between, as supported by the measured flame propagation and pressure traces, calculated heat release rates, as well as time scales describing the combustion progress, e.g. ignition delay and combustion duration. Finally, butanol addition reduces the PN emissions from the GDI engine, and the PN emissions reduction capacity of the four butanol isomers ranks as sec-butanol > iso-butanol > n-butanol > tert-butanol. Also, compared to the PRF/butanol blends, the PN emissions are reduced to a less extent when butanol is blended with TPRF. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, the experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of using hydrogen (H2)andLemon Grass Oil (LGO) as a partial substitute fuel for diesel in a single-cylinder Compression Ignition (CI) engine. Initially, the experiment was conducted with neat diesel and then the engine was modified to operate under dual-fuel mode by inducting H2with intake manifold and LGO as direct injection (DI) fuel. The energy share of H2 was varied from 5 to 10% in this research work. Water (W) was mixed (3% volume) with diesel-LGO blends and its effect on oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) emissions was investigated. An ANN model has been developed to predict the correlation between engine output responses and input factors (load, LGO and hydrogen) using a standard back-propagation algorithm. Response surface methodology is concerned to optimize the engine input parameters in order to minimize the emissions and maximize the thermal efficiency. It was observed that the BTE got increased to 31% for 10%H2 + LGO25 whereas it was 24% for neat LGO and 30% for 10%H2 + LGO25 + 3%W modes. The cylinder pressure increased up to 63 bar for 10%H2mode than neat LGO operation. The HRR, underH2 premixed combustion model was observed to be 79 kJ/CA deg in 10%H2, which is comparatively higher than that of all the LGO operations. The maximum NOx emission was found for 10%H2 + LGO25% at 700 ppm peak load, whereas it reduced to 620 ppm for water-emulsified fuel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An integrated treatment system with co-fermentation of food waste (FW) and syngas generated from digestate pyrolysis was verified as a promising approach to improve biofuel recovery. Syngas was injected and co-fermented with the FW at different injection volumes starting from 560 mL (Stage II). More stable methane production (MP) was exhibited in the thermophilic reactor than the mesophilic reactor. As syngas injection volume gradually increased to 5300 mL in stage V, the MP in the thermophilic reactor was about 22% higher than that in the mesophilic reactor. It was calculated that the syngas was not only almost stoichiometrically converted into CH4 but also accelerated the digestion process of FW, resulting in the improvement of biofuel recovery. The different pathways of syngas biomethanation under the different temperatures were revealed by 16S rRNA genes analysis. Methanosaeta spp. was dominant in the mesophilic reactor and CO and H2 could be converted into acetate and then CH4. On the other hand, hydrogenotrophic methanogens were dominant in the thermophilic reactor indicating that CO may be converted with H2 as the intermediary. This integrated treatment system has the potential for industrial applications and provides a useful approach for the development of a circular bio-economy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - H2-free deoxygenation is a very important process in producing high-quality biofuel without the use of H2 gas supply. Considering the costly price of the noble metals, transition metal (TM) based catalysts are more affordable, and the performance is comparable to the noble metal-based catalyst. In this study, TMO supported on zeolite Y catalysts (Ni-, Cu-, Co-, Zn- and Mn-Y) are prepared via wet-impregnation for deoxygenation of triolein, a model compound of non-edible oil under H2-free condition. The deoxygenation activity of TMO supported on zeolite Y is following the order of Ni-Y &gt; Co-Y &gt; Cu-Y &gt; Mn-Y &gt; Zn-Y. The nickel oxide supported on zeolite-Y (Ni-Y) shows the highest conversion up to 76.21 % with 84.28 % hydrocarbon selectivity after reacted at 380 °C for 2 h. Besides, the selectivity toward diesel range hydrocarbon is 92.61 %. The superior deoxygenation activity of Ni-Y can be related to synergistic effect between the reduced B/L and high hydrogenolysis ability of Ni that promote the decarboxylation reaction, suppress the cracking and polymerization of heavy hydrocarbon. Therefore, Ni-Y is a potential catalyst to obtain high quality green diesel from non-edible oil through catalytic deoxygenation without addition of external H2 source. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Solar energy and biomass are the two major sources of renewable energy, which can be integrated to produce heat, power and transportation fuels, chemicals and biomaterials using pyrolysis. In this work, separate samples of chicken-litter waste and rice husk of different particle sizes (280 and 500 μm) were pyrolysed with a concentrated solar radiation to produce pyrolysis gases of high calorific value. Different operating parameters were investigated under the solar pyrolysis conditions. Heating rates from 10 to 500 °C/s and temperatures in the range of 800–1600 °C, generated from a lab-scale solar furnace with maximum power capacity of 1.5 kW, were applied. Temperature was found to have the highest effect, changing the gas yield from 10 to 39 wt%; decreasing the bio-oil and char yields from 48 to 41 wt % and 42 to 18 wt%, respectively as the temperature increased from 800 to 1600 °C. The highest specific energy content of the gas (7255 kJ/kg) was obtained with the 280 μm particle size chicken litter at 1600 °C. Overall, gases produced from solar assisted biomass pyrolysis have a high concentration of combustible products that could be directly used as fuels in engines or power plants. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recent estimates suggest that the construction sector accounts for approximately one quarter of global CO2 emissions. This paper assesses the potential for reducing the climate impact of road construction. The study is structured as a participatory integrated assessment with involvement from key stakeholders in the supply chain, supported by energy and material flow mapping, an extensive literature review and a scenario analysis. The results indicate that it is technically possible to halve road construction CO2 emissions with today's best available technologies and practices, to abate more than three quarters of the emissions by 2030 and achieve close to net zero emissions by 2045. Realising the current potential would rely on sufficient availability of sustainably produced second-generation biofuels, indicating a need to speed up the implementation of alternative abatement measures, including optimization of material use and mass handling requirements, increased recycling of steel, asphalt and aggregates and enhanced use of alternative binders in concrete. Policy measures and procurement strategies should be aligned to support these measures with a clear supply chain focus. For deep decarbonization several key opportunities and obstacles for realisation of breakthrough technologies for basic industry are highlighted – including electrification and carbon capture for steel and cement, and hybridisation and electrification for heavy transport and construction equipment. There is a clear need to prepare for deeper abatement and associated transformative shifts already now and to carefully consider the pathway of getting there while avoiding pitfalls along the way, such as overreliance on biofuels or cost optimizations which cannot be scaled up to the levels required. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - In this paper, energy, exergy, and sustainability analyses are done for the residential sector of Bangladesh based on statistics from 2000 to 2015. The purpose is to gain a deep understanding and pragmatic perception of this sector's energy consumption. It is found that the energy efficiency varies between 25.54% and 37.77% while the exergy efficiency varies between 6.35% and 9.04%. In order to address the sustainability of this sector several indicators such as depletion number, sustainability index, lack of productivity, relative irreversibility, renewable share, non-renewable share, waste exergy ratio, and environmental effect factor are used. Depletion number varies between 0.91 and 0.94 while sustainability index varies between 1.06 and 1.11. The high rate of depletion of fossil fuels has contributed to a lower value of sustainability index. Among various types of fossil fuel consumed in this sector, both energy and exergy from biofuel is higher, and this is validated from high values obtained for the used indicators. For biofuel, the maximum relative irreversibility is found to be 0.83 and maximum lack of productivity is 12.19. To ensure sustainability and to reduce environmental impact from this sector, it is recommended to introduce sustainable cooking technologies in the rural sector. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The problems of the depleting the worldwide fossil fuel and increasing concern on the environmental regulations force the researchers to look forward to a new source of clean source of energy such as biodiesel. Diesel fuel additives such as the organic compounds can be used with the vehicle's fuel to improve the chemical and physical properties of the in-cylinder charged fuel. The investigation was achieved using two main blends of diesel/biodiesel fuels of B20 (blend of 20% biodiesel and 80% commercial diesel#1 fuel by volume) and B50 (50% biodiesel and 50% commercial diesel#1 fuel by volume). Each diesel/biodiesel blends have mixed with three different concentrations of the Acetone as an oxygenated organic compound of AC2, AC4, and AC6, which represent 2%, 4%, 6% acetone by volume, respectively. The results obtained for B20AC2 showed that the Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTE) was enhanced by 12.64% when compared with the commercial diesel#1 fuel. Besides, there are a reduction of 18.09% and 11.22% for the exhaust gas temperature and specific energy consumption, respectively. The Carbon monoxide (CO), Carbon dioxide (CO2), UHC, and Particulate matter emissions were reduced dramatically by 63.38%, 22.69%, 47.76%, and 40.84%, in that orders. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Three nickel-alumina catalysts were prepared with nickel content 60, 80 and 90 wt % (symbols: 60NiAl, 80NiAl, 90NiAl) following a co-precipitation methodology. The catalysts were characterized and evaluated in the selective deoxygenation of waste cooking oil for the production of third generation green diesel under solvent free conditions. Metallic Ni, NiO, and NiAl2O4 were detected in the 60NiAl catalyst. NiAl2O4 is hardly detected in the 80NiAl catalyst but not at all in the 90NiAl catalyst. The extent of reduction of NiO to metallic Ni upon activation is considerably higher in the 80NiAl and 90NiAl samples with respect to the 60NiAl sample resulting in much higher active site population. The increase in the nickel content causes a change in the porous structure and a decrease in the specific surface area. The catalytic performance increases considerably from the 60NiAl catalyst to the 80NiAl one due to the increase in the active site population. The higher catalytic performance of the 80NiAl catalyst with respect to that of the 90NiAl catalyst, exhibiting almost equal active site population, is due to convenient porous structure of 80NiAl catalyst, which hinder the insertion of deleterious bulky compounds present in the waste cooking oil, as well as to its strong acid sites. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bioalcohols have recently become one of the promising alternate fuels. Lower alcohols exhibit some problems like phase separation, stability issues, storage problems, corrosion etc. Hence, the addition of higher alcohols is regarded least-problematic and the concept of using higher alcohols as fuel blends is relatively new. In this article, the effects of the addition of higher alcohol (1-pentanol) on engine performance and emission characteristics are discussed. Two reference fuels (diesel and biodiesel derived from waste cooking oil) and two test fuels (blends of 20% of 1-pentanol and 80% of either diesel or biodiesel) are tested in a single cylinder compression ignition diesel engine for six load conditions (0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 kg) at a constant speed of 1200 rpm. The engine performance and emission characteristics are determined and discussed. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to predict the performance and emission characteristics of micro gas turbine engines powered by alternate fuels. The micro gas turbine engine performance, combustion and emission characteristics are analyzed for the jet fuel with different additives. Design/methodology/approach: The experimental investigation was carried out with Jet A-1 fuel on the gas turbine engines at different load conditions. The primary blends of the Jet A-1 fuels are from canola and solid waste pyrolysis oil. Then the ultrasonication of highly concentrated multiwall carbon nanotubes is carried with the primary blends of canola (Jet-A fuel 70%, canola 20% and 10% ethanol) and P20E (Jet-A 70% fuel, 20% PO and 10% ethanol). Findings: The consumption of the fuel is appreciable with the blends at a very high static thrust. The 39% reduction in thrust specific fuel consumption associated with a 32% enhance in static thrust with P20E blend among different fuel blends. Moreover, due to the increase in ethanol concentration in the blends PO20E and C20E lead to a 22% rise in thermal efficiency and a 9% increase in higher oxygen content is observed. Practical implications: The gas turbine engine emits very low emission of gases such as CO, CO2 and NOx by using the fuel blends, which typically reduces the fossil fuel usage limits with reduced pollutants. Originality/value: The emission of the gas turbine engines is further optimized with the addition of hydrogen in Jet-A fuel. That is leading to high specific fuel exergy and owing to the lower carbon content in the hydrogen fuel when compared with that of the fossil fuels used in gas turbine engines. Therefore, the usage of hydrogen with nanofluids was so promising based on the results obtained for replacing fossil fuels. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The present study is based on “waste to energy” concept, wherein the potential of almond crop residues viz., almond shells were investigated for biofuel production via different bioprocesses. Three routes, namely A1 representing hythane production through two-stage anaerobic digestion (TSAD), A2 representing ethanolic fermentation and A3 representing coupled ethanol and hythane production were evaluated for maximizing energy recovery. Results showed that in route A1, increased H2/(H2 + CH4) ratio (0.53) resulted in inappropriate hythane composition which was attributed to higher hydrogen yield of 236.6 L/kg chemical oxygen demand removed (CODr) and lower methane production (203.9 L/kg CODr) in the respective route. In route A2, sole ethanol production led to much lower carbon conversion efficiency (25.7%) and energy yield (6173.1 kJ/kg CODr) that questions the feasibility and efficiency of this process. However, in route A3, coupled ethanol and hythane production led to increased substrate degradation (91.3%) and higher carbon conversion efficiency (75.1%) resulting in enhanced energy recovery (22156.6 kJ/kg CODr) as compared to A1 route (13573.6 kJ/kg CODr). The stable H2/(H2 + CH4) ratio of 0.29 obtained in route A3 makes this pathway most suitable for efficient co-production of both biofuels. Further, linking of biochemical conversion process with thermochemical process viz., pyrolysis to produce biochar from almond shell residue, could be seen as an effective strategy for waste management and for enhancing the economic viability of the process. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The demand for alternative fuels has risen in recent years due to the economic and environmental consequences of conventional fuels. In addition to engine characteristics, i.e., performance, combustion, and emission the lubricity of the considered fuel is an important parameter for its selection. This experimental study shows the tribological performance of the tire pyrolysis oil by using the four-ball tester. Waste tire pyrolysis oil was purified by using the distillation process. The experiment was conducted over 300 s at 40, 50, 63, and 80 kg load, 1800 rpm constant speed, and 27◦ C temperature of all fuels on the ASTM D2266 standard. The tribological performance of the tire pyrolysis oil was compared with the BT10 (biodiesel 90%–tire pyrolysis oil 10%) and BT20 (biodiesel 80%–tire pyrolysis oil 20%) and biodiesel. The optical microscope is used to measure the wear scar diameter and then it is examined through a scanning electron microscope. In terms of greater load-carrying capacity, tire pyrolysis oil shows better anti-wear behaviour compared to biodiesel fuel. The wear scar diameter of BT10, BT20, and tire pyrolysis oil was 23.99%, 8.37%, and 32.62%, respectively, lower than the biodiesel fuel at 80 kg load. The SEM micrographs revealed that tire pyrolysis oil and BT10 displayed lower wear as compared to counterparts. Finally, it is concluded that BT10 is the most suitable fuel in terms of tribological performance. © MDPI AG. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nanostructured calcium oxides supported onto biochar obtained by pyrolysis of avocado seeds were prepared, characterized and successfully used as catalysts to produce biodiesel from waste oils. The effect of increasing calcium load (5, 10 and 20 wt%) was investigated. Elemental analysis, FTIR, XRD, SEM, BET, acid and basic sites were used to characterize the resulting carbon-based calcium oxides. Supported systems efficiently promoted the transesterification of oil with methanol, but differently from calcium oxide, they were easily recoverable and reusable for three cycles without any loss of activity. Kinetic data were better fitted by a pseudo-second order model with an activation energy of 39.9 kJ mol−1. Thermodynamic parameters of activation energy were also determined for the transesterification reaction (Δ‡ G: 98.68-106.08 kJ mol−1, Δ‡ H: 37.05 kJ mol−1 and Δ‡S: 0.185 kJ mol−1 K). Finally, reaction conditions were optimized using the desirability function applied on the response surface methodology analysis of a Box–Behnken factorial design of experiments. By carrying out the reaction at 99.5 °C for 5 h with 7.3 wt% of catalyst and a molar ratio of methanol to oil of 15.6, a FAME content over 96% was achieved. Even starting from waste cooking oil, final biodiesel was conform to the main EN14214 specifications. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recently, we have introduced a new bioeconomic indicator in order to avoid the difficulties in evaluating the process and technologies for sustainability. In this paper, we wish to improve this new indicator for the analysis of sustainability. Indeed, the indicator has been based on the exergy analysis of dissipation and irreversibility, and it was proven in some social and technical application. In this work, a more general definition has been introduced in order to use it in any evaluation of sustainability. In particular, it has been applied to improve the biofuel production obtained by microorganisms, starting from the biophysical behaviour of the microorganisms themselves. Indeed, in industrialised countries, the management of CO2 emissions represents one of the present compelling issues. In this context, the improvement of the energy efficiency, and its rational use, can be considered a fundamental economic strategy for the sustainable development of the industrialised countries. Our indicator takes into account all these requests for the development and sustainability, resulting a very interesting thermoeconomic quantity to be used by decision makers. Moreover, it is used to prove that mutualism can represent a new approach for the optimisation of biofuels production. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - One of the essential characteristics of diesel oils is their cetane number (CN) which indicates the ignition delay of the fuel in the process. In this study, using PSO-ANFIS technique, CNs of biodiesel and conventional diesel (called petrodiesel) oils were modeled and estimated based on the fatty acid methyl ester compositions of biodiesel oils and carbon type structure of the diesel fuels. For the first time, novel correlations were developed for the estimation of CNs of biodiesel and conventional diesel oils. For the models development, as the raw data, 232 biodiesel and 134 conventional diesel oils samples were derived from the literature. Based on the obtained results, the coefficient determinations (R2) of 0.91 and 0.93 and %AARD of 6.4 and 9.6 were obtained by PSO-ANFIS and MNR models for the estimation of biodiesel oil CN, respectively. The R2 of 0.98 and 0.96 and %AARD of 2 and 2.9 were resulted using PSO-ANFIS and MNR models for the prognostication of diesel oil CN, respectively. Based on the gained results, PSO-ANFIS and MNR algorithms are capable of estimating the biodiesel and diesel oils CNs. The novelty of this study is the development of novel correlations and smart models with high accuracies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Presently methanol based dual fuel reactivity controlled compression ignition (DFRCCI) has more and more attention in fuel and engine research field because of its potential in reducing the engine-out harmful emissions and evading the dependency on fossil fuel resources. However, while using methanol along with diesel in DFRCCI combustion, a substantial increase in incomplete combustion loss was observed at lower loads due to lower fuel stratification, global reactivity and in-cylinder temperature. Hence, to address this limitation, diesel fuel was replaced by a biodiesel, and a detailed experimental study was performed with energy and exergy analysis to show the potential of biodiesel over diesel. In this study, a modified automotive diesel engine was tested under CDC and DFRCCI combustion strategy using Methanol/ Diesel (M/D) and Methanol/ Biodiesel (M/BD) fuel combinations at 2100 rpm, 3.4 bar BMEP load condition. The experimental parametric study shows that 60% of methanol energy can be effectively utilised with an advanced direct injection and a moderate level of exhaust gas recirculation. Energy analysis clearly indicated the reason for the improvement in brake thermal efficiency in DFRCCI combustion. Reduced energy loss in the exhaust and coolant, increased brake thermal efficiency was observed in DFRCCI compared to CDC. However, increased incomplete combustion loss was observed in M/D DFRCCI combustion compared to CDC. Whereas, reduced incomplete combustion loss was observed while using biodiesel instead of diesel due to increased fuel stratification caused by the physical properties of biodiesel and in-cylinder temperature. Further, lower exergy destruction was observed in M/BD DFRCCI compared to M/D DFRCCI combustion. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In order to explore the different characteristics of bio-fuels generated by microwave pyrolysis of sludge in the temperature and power control modes, the differences in the distribution, composition, lower heating value and energy utilization efficiency have been analyzed. The heat conversion mechanism was preliminarily explored via changes in the dielectric constants of the sludge. The results showed that: First, there were differences between the two modes during the pyrolysis process. This was the main reason that the lower heating value of the products in the temperature control mode was higher than it in the power control mode. For instance, the lower heating values of bio-gas and bio-oil generated at 800 °C were 16.04 MJ/kg and 35.96 MJ/kg, respectively. Second, the energy utilization efficiency of the temperature control mode was higher than that of the power control mode. This was because the required microwave energy input in the temperature control mode (40.32–65.52 MJ) was lower than that in the power control mode (72.80–88.00 MJ). This can be proven by the integral calculation results of output power and reaction time. Third, during the process of microwave pyrolysis, the ability of sludge to absorb microwave energy and convert it into heat (tanθ) first decreased and then increased due to the water evaporation and subsequent formation of pyrolysis residues. Therefore, choosing a suitable pyrolysis mode (temperature control mode) and condition (800 °C) is crucial to improving the efficiencies of resource recovery and energy utilization. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The use of renewable jet fuels (RJFs) is an option for meeting the greenhouse gases (GHG) reduction targets of the aviation sector. Therefore, most of the studies have focused on climate change indicators, but other environmental impacts have been disregarded. In this paper, an attributional life cycle assessment is performed for ten RJF pathways in Brazil, considering the environmental trade-offs between climate change and seven other categories, i.e., fossil depletion, terrestrial acidification, eutrophication, human and environmental toxicity, and air quality-related categories, such as particulate matter and photochemical oxidant formation. The scope includes sugarcane and soybean for first-generation (1G) pathways and residual materials (wood and sugarcane residues, beef tallow, and used cooking oil-UCO) for second-generation (2G) pathways. Three certified technologies to produce RJF are considered: hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA), alcohol-to-jet (ATJ), and Fischer-Tropsch (FT). Assuming the residual feedstocks as wastes or by-products, the 2G pathways are evaluated by two different approaches, in which the biomass sourcing processes are either accounted for or not. Results show that 1G pathways lead to significant GHG reductions compared to fossil kerosene from 55% (soybean/HEFA) to 65% (sugarcane/ATJ). However, the sugarcane-based pathway generated three-fold higher values than fossil kerosene for terrestrial acidification and air quality impacts, and seven-fold for eutrophication. In turn, soybean/HEFA caused five-fold higher levels of human toxicity. For 2G pathways, when the residual feedstock is assumed to be waste, the potential GHG emission reduction is over 74% with no relevant trade-offs. On the other hand, if the residual feedstocks are assumed as valuable by-products, tallow/HEFA becomes the worst option and pathways from sugarcane residues, even providing a GHG reduction of 67% to 94%, are related to higher impacts than soybean/HEFA for terrestrial acidification and air quality. FT pathways represent the lowest impacts for all categories within both approaches, followed by UCO/HEFA. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Olive mill wastewater (OMWW) management is recognized as the major defy that olive oil industry is facing. Recently, we have established an eco-friendly strategy for the OMWW conversion into irrigation water sources, green biofuels and biofertilizers. This work is a part of a series of papers detailing the different steps established in this environmental friendly strategy for OMWW management. It deals with the bio-oil production and characterization during the pyrolysis of OMWW impregnated on olive pomace (OP) in a pyrolyzer pilot. Results show a bio-oil production yield of 36 wt% during the pyrolysis test. This yield could be attributed to the recovery of organic compounds from OMWW through OP impregnation and their conversion to bio-oil. The bio-oil properties show that viscosity and flash point values could reach the European standards. However, the lower heating values (26 MJ/kg) and the acidic character limit its direct use. These values are attributed to the higher water and oxygen contents. The GC/MS analysis confirms these properties showing the presence of phenolic molecules and long chain organic acids. Therefore, OMWW impregnation on OP and pyrolysis could be considered as a promising issue for bio-oil production. However, this bio-oil requires an upgrading step for a better valorization. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The large quantities of residual biomass produced in the palm oil industry have become one of the main environmental and financial concerns of this industry. For this reason, biorefineries are gaining strength in recent years, since through their production model the residual biomass can be used as raw material to produce bioenergetics (biofuels and bio-products), hence contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gases emissions. Therefore, the main objective of this work is to compare and evaluate alternatives to convert a conventional palm oil mill into a biorefinery considering energy and environmental sustainability indicators. In this context, this work presents a study of three scenarios: the first (I), the base case, consists of a traditional palm oil mill; the second (II) considers a palm oil mill working under the biorefinery concept that uses the fast pyrolysis process for the production of bio-oil and biochar; and the third (III) considers a biorefinery that, besides incorporating the pyrolysis process, has an extraction/transesterification stage for the production of biodiesel and glycerin in the palm oil mill. The surplus electricity index was calculated for the three scenarios, and scenario III was the most favorable, achieving 110.23 kW per ton of fresh fruit bunch with an overall efficiency of 82.69%. The environmental assessment carried out for scenario III indicates that environmental impacts of bio-oil production are 32.5% lower than the ones to produce electricity (climate change category) and 14.2% lower than environmental impacts to produce biodiesel (resources category), demonstrating that the production of bio-oil using fast pyrolysis result in lower environmental impacts compared with the other products obtained in the biorefinery. Finally, the Net Energy Ratio was calculated for the scenario with the best thermodynamic performance (scenario III: 21.17) and compared with previously published studies, resulting in a gain of total energy flow of up to 17.77. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Palm oil mill effluent (POME), a liquid waste from the palm oil industry, presents an alternative source for biodiesel production without interfering with food supply. This study attempted to produce biodiesel from untreated POME with aqueous ethanol using Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase as a biocatalyst. The effects of enzyme concentration, alcohol to oil ratio, and ethanol concentration were considered in the transesterification reaction. The optimum conditions were 2100 U lipase loading, 4 : 1 ethanol to oil molar ratio, and 45% (v/v) ethanol concentration at 40 °C reaction, and under 24 hours. The maximum fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) yield reached 97.43% (w/w) under these conditions. Integration of dilute ethanol for the conversion of POME to biodiesel could be promising as both feedstocks could be obtained from the same location, and thus reduce the logistical burden on biodiesel production.

AB  - This work details the synthesis and characterization of iron nanoparticles (GT-INP) from green-tea extract and its effect on biohydrogen production from CO by anaerobic biomass. Analysis of the GT-INP by UV–visible spectroscopy revealed spherical or quasi-spherical shape of the iron oxide nanoparticles. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the presence of iron oxide (Fe3O4) and iron(III) oxide-hydroxide (FeO(OH)) in the GT-INP. The appearance of strong vibrational bands in fourier transform infrared spectra indicated the presence of amide, C–N and hydroxyl groups due to flavonoids, alkaloids and polyphenols as capping agents in the GT-INP. Field emission scanning electron microscopy and field emission transmission electron microscopy analyses revealed that the size of GT-INP was within 50–90 nm range with a spherical shaped aggregated structure. In the presence of GT-INP at 1000 mg/l, more than 56 ± 5.32% enhancement in aqueous solubility of CO was achieved along with a maximum H2 production of 1.58 ± 0.13 mmol/l by anaerobic biomass, which is nearly 44% more than that obtained without any GT-INP addition. Continuous bioreactor study using a gas lift reactor further established the potential of GT-INP in improving biohydrogen production from CO with a maximum H2 titre of 30.7 mmol/l due to GT-INP addition in the system. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present study, hybrid bio-support catalyst (BSC) has been prepared for the production of biodiesel from Castor oil. Lipase from Pseudomonas cepacia has been immobilized on a hybrid bio-support material (BSM) by entrapment method and characterized. The highest immobilized lipase activity and loading efficiency were 87.28 (U/g) and 55.2%, respectively. The composition of Castor oil expelled from Castor seeds evaluated through Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS) technique. GCMS spectra show the percentage composition of ricinoleic, linoleic, oleic, stearic, palmitic, and nonanoic acid, as 78.67, 9.62, 6.65, 1.53, 2.19, and 0.08, respectively. Optimized conditions for the transesterification of Castor oil with propan-2-ol as acyl acceptor in solvent free medium were, 10% immobilized lipase relying on oil-weight, molar ratio of alcohol to oil (6:1) at 50±1°C for the period of 24 h. The product yield was estimated as 75% while the calculated conversion of biodiesel was approximately 78%. The reusability of hybrid BSC for 12 runs was found to be 70% of its initial biodiesel yield after 6 cycles. The properties of oil and biodiesel were calculated using American Standards for Testing Material (ASTM) D6751; formation of biodiesel confirmed by Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analysis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Some Rhodotorula spp. have been characterized as oleaginous yeasts. Under certain culture conditions they can accumulate neutral lipids, which are mainly triglycerides (TAG). Microbial TAG that can be used as raw material for biodiesel synthesis are attractive for the biofuel industry. In this study, the ability to synthesize lipids of Rhodotorula glutinis R4, isolated in Antarctica, was compared with eight strains belonging to the genera Rhodotorula and Yarrowia with the aim of proposing a novel source of oils for biodiesel synthesis. All strains were cultured under nitrogen (N) limiting conditions and an excess of carbon (C) in the culture medium. We found that yeasts accumulated between 9–48.9 % (w/w) of lipids. Among them, R. glutinis R4 showed the highest growth (14 g L−1, μmax 0,092 h−1) and lipid production (7 g L−1; 47 % w/w). Microbial oils produced by R. glutinis R4 are similar to vegetable oils, with 61 % of oleic acid, indicating that it is adequate for biodiesel synthesis. Our results demonstrate that biodiesel derived from R. glutinis R4 complies with international fuel standards ASTM D6751 and EN 14214. Therefore, this work demonstrates that Rhodotorula glutinis R4 is a novel and valuable source of microbial oils for biodiesel synthesis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biofuels have gained much attention in the recent years. Microalgae hold tremendous potential for production of biofuels as a suitable alternative to conventional fossil fuels. However, in order to ensure sustainability of the biofuel production from microalgae, many issues needs to be considered. Large-scale production of such biofuels is often limited by high cost of production, various environmental concerns including water footprint, and low yield. The algal biorefinery strategy, which can integrate several different conversion technologies to produce biofuels, holds potential for reducing the overall production cost. This paper is a review on various aspects associated with algal cultivation, lipid extraction and biodiesel production. Different factors reported to affect the process of algal cultivation and advancements in transesterification process and product recovery are summarized here. A brief on biorefinery approach is also discussed. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Thermally stratified compression ignition is a new advanced, low-temperature combustion mode that aims to control the heat release process in a lean, premixed, compression ignition combustion mode by controlling the level of thermal stratification in the cylinder. Specifically, this work uses a mixture of 80% ethanol and 20% water by mass, referred to as “wet ethanol” herein, to increase thermal stratification via evaporative cooling of areas targeted by an injection event during the compression stroke. The experiments conducted aim to both fundamentally understand the effect that a late cycle injection of wet ethanol has on the heat release process, and to use that effect to explore the high-load limit of thermally stratified compression ignition with wet ethanol. At an equivalence ratio of 0.5, injecting just 8% of the fuel during the compression stroke was shown to reduce the peak heat release rate by a factor of 2, subsequently avoiding excessive pressure rise rates. Under pure homogeneous charge compression ignition using wet ethanol as the fuel, the load range was found to be 2.5–3.9 bar gross indicated mean effective pressure. Using a split injection of wet ethanol, the high-load limit was extended to 7.0 bar gross indicated mean effective pressure under naturally aspirated conditions. Finally, intake boost was used to achieve high-load operation with low NOx (oxides of nitrogen (NO or NO2)) emissions and was shown to further increase the high-load limit to 7.6 bar gross indicated mean effective pressure at an intake pressure of 1.43 bar. These results show the ability of a split injection of wet ethanol to successfully control the heat release process and expand the operable load range in low-temperature combustion. © IMechE 2018.

AB  - This study is focused on artificial neural network (ANN) modelling of non-modified diesel engine keyed up by the combination of two low viscous biofuels to forecast the parameters of emission and performance. The diesel engine is energised with five different test fuels of the combination of citronella and Cymbopogon flexuous biofuel (C50CF50) with diesel at precise blends of B20, B30, B40, B50 and B100 in which these numbers represent the contents of combination of biofuel and the investigation is carried out from zero to full load condition. The experimental result was found that the B20 blend had improved BTE at all load states compared with the remaining biofuel blends. At 100% load state, BTE (31.5%) and fuel consumption (13.01 g/kW-h) for the B20 blend was closer to diesel. However, the B50 blend had minimal HC (0.04 to 0.157 g/kW-h), CO (0.89 to 2.025 g/kW-h) and smoke (7.8 to 60.09%) emission than other test fuels at low and high load states. The CO2 emission was the penalty for complete combustion. The NOx emission was higher for all the biodiesel blends than diesel by 6.12%, 8%, 11.53%, 14.81% and 3.15% for B20, B30, B40, B50 and B100 respectively at 100% load condition. The reference parameters are identified as blend concentration percentage and brake power values. The trained ANN models exhibit a magnificent value of 97% coefficient of determination and the high R values ranging between 0.9076 and 0.9965 and the low MAPE values ranging between 0.98 and 4.26%. The analytical results also provide supportive evidence for the B20 blend which in turn concludes B20 as an effective alternative fuel for diesel. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Algae have been considered as a best feedstock for combating CO2. In the present study, two mixed microalgal cultures i.e. MAC1 and MAC2 were evaluated in batch mode with an extraneous supply of CO2 from the fermentation of wheat straw. Both the mixed cultures displayed promising CO2 sequestration potentials of 287 and 263 mg L−1d−1, respectively. The removal efficiencies in terms of ammonium, phosphate, chemical oxygen demand, and nitrate were found to be 87%, 78%, 68% and 65%, respectively. Enriching the tolerance of the microalgal consortia to CO2 supply and wastewater as the nutrient source significantly enhanced the lipid production for both the microalgae consortia. Lipid contents of MAC1 and MAC2 were observed to be 12.29 &amp; 11.37%, respectively while the biomass yield from both the consortia was 0.36 g L-1. Total chlorophyll and protein contents of MAC1 and MAC2 were 14.27 &amp; 12.28 µgmL−1 and 0.13 &amp; 0.15 mgmL−1, respectively. Both the consortia found to have significant potential for CO2 sequestration, wastewater remediation and biofuel production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biofuels are considered sustainable and renewable alternatives to conventional fossil fuels. Biobutanol has recently emerged as an attractive option compared to bioethanol and biodiesel, but a significant challenge in its production lies in the separation stage. The current industrial process for the production of biobutanol includes the ABE (acetone-butanol-ethanol) fermentation process from biomass; the resulting fermentation broth has a butanol concentration of no more than 2 wt% (the rest is essentially water). Therefore, the development of a cost-effective process for separation of butanol from dilute aqueous solutions is highly desirable. The use of porous materials for the adsorptive separation of ABE mixtures is considered a highly promising route, as these materials can potentially have high affinities for alcohols and low affinities for water. To date, zeolites have been tested toward this separation, but their hydrophilic nature makes them highly incompetent for this application. The use of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is an apparent solution; however, their low hydrolytic stabilities hinder their implementation in this application. So far, a few nanoporous zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) have shown excellent potential for butanol separation due to their good hydrolytic and thermal stabilities. Herein, we present a novel, porous, and hydrophobic MOF based on copper ions and carborane-carboxylate ligands, mCB-MOF-1, for butanol recovery. mCB-MOF-1 exhibits excellent stability when immersed in organic solvents, water at 90 °C for at least two months, and acidic and basic aqueous solutions. We found that, like ZIF-8, mCB-MOF-1 is non-porous to water (type II isotherm), but it has higher affinity for ethanol, butanol, and acetone compared to ZIF-8, as suggested by the shape of the vapor isotherms at the crucial low-pressure region. This is reflected in the separation of a realistic ABE mixture in which mCB-MOF-1 recovers butanol more efficiently compared to ZIF-8 at 333 K. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The present study investigates the effect of water emulsion and ZnO nanoparticle on the emissions pattern of a diesel engine running with SB. Test fuels were prepared based on the different percentage of water and mass fractions of nanoparticle, and the emission characteristics were compared with SB. The physicochemical properties were measured based on EN14214 standards, and the characteristics of nano-fuels were examined using SEM, EDS and UV–visible absorption spectrum. Experiments were carried out in a computerized, single-cylinder, four-stroke diesel engine with an eddy current dynamometer. The experimental results reveal that SB20W emulsion fuel promotes a drop of 41.4% and 28.3% in NOx and smoke emissions at BP of 2.56 kW compared to SB, respectively. SB10W emulsion fuel promotes an improvement of 40% and 33.3% in HC and CO emissions compared to SB at 2.56 kW BP, respectively. An inclusion of ZnO nanoparticle in SB20W emulsion fuel significantly reduces the NOx, HC, CO and smoke emissions irrespective of load conditions, and an increase in the mass fraction of nanoparticle further reduces the emissions level. At 2.56 kW BP, SB20W100ZnO emulsion fuel reduces the NOx, HC, CO and smoke emissions by 7.1%, 40%, 33.3% and 15.1% compared to SB20W emulsion fuel, respectively. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This article addresses the life cycle optimization (LCO) of the poultry litter supply chain considering pyrolysis technologies that aim to sustainably convert poultry waste into biofuel and biochar. A multiobjective optimization framework integrated with a life cycle analysis methodology is developed. The economic objective is to maximize annualized profit per functional unit, and the environmental objective is to minimize the annual CO2-equivalent greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per functional unit. The formulated multiobjective mixed-integer fractional programming problems are solved using an ϵ-constraint method and parametric algorithm. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed framework, a case study on the State of Georgia is presented. The Pareto-optimal solutions illustrate a clear trade-off between the unit annualized profit and the unit annual CO2-eq GHG emission. The most economically profitable solution has an annualized profit of $91/ton poultry litter dry matter (DM) and an annual sequestration of 0.04 kg CO2-eq/ton DM. The most environmentally sustainable solution has a profit of-$1.02/ton DM and annual emissions of-511 kg CO2-eq/ton DM. Through spatial analysis, a clear correlation between pyrolysis facility locations and poultry litter production amount is revealed. Sensitivity analyses reveal biochar price and storage periods of unpyrolyzed poultry manure to be the greatest factors that influence the economics and environmental objectives, respectively. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The current and future consumption of petroleum-based plastics, which will be 20% of global annual oil comsumption by 2050, is leading to the investigation and development of feedstock alternatives. Algae-based plastics offer a promising substitute that would decrease oil consumption, improve environmental impact, and in some cases even improve plastic performance. This study investigates the economic viability and environmental impact of an algae biorefinery that integrates the complementary functions of bioplastic feedstock (BPFS) and fuel production. The BPFS and biofuel biorefinery modeled herein includes nine different production scenarios. Performance of the facility was validated based on experimental systems with modeling work focusing on mass and energy balances of all required sub-processes in the production pathway. Results show that the minimum selling price of the BPFS is within the realm of economic competition with prices as low as $970 USD tonne− 1. Additionally, life cycle impact assessment results indicate drastic improvements in performance of the produced BPFS, with reductions in greenhouse gas emissions ranging between 67 and 116% compared to a petroleum-based plastic feedstock. These results indicate that an algae biorefinery focused on BPFS production and fuels has the potential to operate both economically and sustainably. Sensitivity analysis results, alternative co-products (given that fuels represent minimal value) and product market potential are also discussed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this paper, biodiesel was used to upgrade bio-oil by extracting the high-quality fuel fractions in bio-oil through solvent extraction. After the extraction, the upper layer blends of biodiesel and the high-quality bio-oil components, also called the “extraction phase liquid”, was obtained and denoted as EPBB. Firstly, Thermogravimetric (TG) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analyses indicated that the light components originally in bio-oil, such as alcohols, ethers, ketones and carboxylic acids were extracted from bio-oil to biodiesel and formed the EPBB. Then the fuel properties of EPBB were measured at different temperatures. The results showed that the density of EPBB was higher, while its viscosity, surface tension and lower heating value (LHV) were lower than those of biodiesel. Accordingly, EPBB revealed better atomization and evaporation characteristics as compared to biodiesel. Finally, the engine performance of EPBB was tested on an unmodified direct-injection diesel engine. When compared with biodiesel, the ignition delay of EPBB was longer, the premixed combustion duration was longer, while the total combustion duration was shorter. The fuel economy of EPBB was comparable to that of biodiesel, and the NOx, soot, CO and UHC emissions of EPBB were all lower than those of biodiesel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The reported study discusses fuel-grade mahua oil methyl esters production from Madhuca indica oil, utilizing Delonix regia pods as a precursor to develop activated carbon support for preparing sulfonated carbon catalyst by H2SO4 impregnation. Raw pods were found to be thermally stable based on TGA analysis, making it suitable as raw material for catalyst synthesis. The catalyst is characterized using BET, XRD, SEM and FT-IR to check desired properties like surface area, porosity enhancement and doping of required functional groups. MOME production is optimized through L16 Taguchi design. Optimum yield of 97.04% is observed at 50 °C for 1 h with 4% w/w catalyst, methanol:oil of 6:1 and 1000 rpm. Catalyst load (1−4% w/w) affects the reaction most prominently, while methanol to oil molar ratio (3:1–12:1) is insignificant. The optimal product is characterized through ASTM standardized tests and gas chromatography analysis and conforms to acceptable biodiesel properties. The reaction adheres to pseudo-first order kinetics with low EA (4.257 kJ/mol) and high A (174.66 min−1). Catalyst shows appreciable reusability with &gt;85% yield after 4 uses. Cost analysis of catalyst preparation shows that indigenously developed catalyst cuts down biodiesel production costs, thus the production process discussed is lucrative for commercialization. © 2019

AB  - The performance and emission from diesel engine using biodiesel from waste coconut oil (WCOO) with and without additives is accessed in this article. WCOO biodiesel is produced from coconuts which are not favorable to be consumed by humans due to degradation. B20, B40, B50, and B100 biodiesel blends of WCOO are prepared and performance and emission testing are done. B20 blend of biodiesel is added with 5%, 10%, and 15% of 1-hepatanol and the tests are repeated. Then, B20 is added with 5% of 1-hepatnol, n-butanol, and iso-butanol as additive and separate analysis for each additive in B20 is carried out in similar way. The injection pressure was kept constant at 225 bar throughout these experiments. Later, B20, B40, B50, and B100 blends of WCOO are used separately for engine performance and emission behavior at 175 injection pressure without adding any additive. Brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and brake thermal efficiency are the factors analyzed during engine performance analysis and CO, CO2, HC, and NO x exhaust are recorded during emission analysis. From the comparative study, the engine performance of diesel is seen to be better than any other combination of biofuels at both the pressures. Among blends without additive, B20 performed better than other blends, B20 with n-butanol performed better than B20 without additive, while B20 with iso-butanol did not show any significant advantage. At 175 bar injection pressure 7.5% extra BSFC and approximately 16% more emission is obtained than at 225 bar pressure. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Using larvae of the black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens; BSF) to convert low-value residual organic resources into high-value products like protein-rich animal feed ingredients and biofuel while managing organic waste has developed into a global industry. Considering the associated exponential increase in publications dealing with diet conversion efficiency by BSF larvae, it is timely to suggest procedures to arrive at an improved harmonization and reproducibility among studies. This means establishing protocols for describing the basic experiment design, fly colony origin, rearing procedures, reference and experimental feeding substrates, and sampling preparations including microbiota and chemical analyses. Such standardised protocols are instrumental to allow conversion efficiencies to be calculated. Some of these parameters are relatively easy to describe such as giving the origin and rearing conditions, while others are more challenging (e.g. description of microbe community). In this article we discuss and propose such procedures with the aim to arrive at standardisation of how future resource conversion studies with BSF larvae are conducted and how results are communicated. © 2020 © 2019 Wageningen Academic Publishers

AB  - A total of 11 yeast strains of Yarrowia lipolytica, Metschnikowia sp., Rhodotorula sp. and Rhodosporidium toruloides were grown under nitrogen-limited conditions with crude glycerol employed as substrate in shake flasks, presenting interesting dry cell weight (DCW) production. Three of these strains belonging to Metschnikowia sp. accumulated significant quantities of endopolysaccharides (i.e. the strain V.V.-D4 produced 11.0 g/L of endopolysaccharides, with polysaccharides in DCW ≈ 63% w/w). A total of six Y. lipolytica strains produced either citric acid or mannitol. Most of the screened yeasts presented somehow elevated lipid and polysaccharides in DCW values at the early steps of growth despite nitrogen appearance in the fermentation medium. Lipid in DCW values decreased as growth proceeded. R. toruloides DSM 4444 cultivated on media presenting higher glycerol concentrations presented interesting lipid-accumulating capacities (maximum lipid = 12.5 g/L, maximum lipid in DCW = 43.0-46.0% w/w, conversion yield on glycerol = 0.16 g/g). Replacement of crude glycerol by xylose resulted in somehow decreased lipid accumulation. In xylose/glycerol mixtures, xylose was more rapidly assimilated from glycerol. R. toruloides total lipids were mainly composed of triacylglycerols. Total cellular fatty acid composition on xylose presented some differences compared with that on glycerol. Cellular lipids contained mainly oleic and palmitic acid. © FEMS 2020. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this investigation, three chemical processes for biodiesel production evaluated based on the financial standpoint. Due to its strongness and flexibility in economic evaluations, the COMFAR III software utilized for assessing processes. The alkali catalyzed process using virgin vegetable oil (process I), an-acid catalyzed process utilizing waste cooking oil (process II), and two-step supercritical methanol process using waste cooking oil (process III) considered as three deferent chemical processes and financial analyzes applied on all processes. The results of financial evaluation revealed that the process II with 2.992 million $, had the lowest manufacturing prices and with 7.541 million $ net present value would be considered as the most attractive proposal for investment. However, concerning total equipment costs of process III (1.141 million $) and its fixed investment prices (2.158 million $), this process selected as the most economically attractive process. In the next step, to evaluate the impacts of increased sales revenue, reduction in fixed assets, and operating costs on net present value, a sensitivity analysis was carried out. Sensitivity evaluation revealed that alteration in operating costs significantly impacts the net present value, and this significant change is more tangible in the process III. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Power-to-Fuel (PtF) systems use carbon dioxide and hydrogen as feedstock together for renewable fuel production and can hence contribute to climate change mitigation. This study assesses the environmental performance, from cradle to gate, of an innovative PtF system for synthetic methanol production, which integrates a biogas plant based on manure and straw residues as well as a combined heat and power unit. Under this concept, the residual carbon dioxide from biogas production is used for the synthesis of methanol, whereas hydrogen is obtained via wind-based electrolysis. A life cycle assessment (LCA) is carried out here for 1 kg of methanol produced with the integrated system proposed, operated on a small scale. In view of the multi-functionality of the process, the uncertainty in LCA outcomes is assessed by considering different assumptions on co-product credits for both the electricity from cogeneration and the digestate from the anaerobic digestion of organic raw materials. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis is performed to examine the influence of variability in life cycle inventory data on the results. All the analysed scenarios show significant improvements compared with conventional methanol production from fossil resources. The sensitivity analysis shows that parameters determining the overall energy requirements as well as methane losses from anaerobic digestion in the PtF system greatly influence its environmental performance, and should be carefully considered in process design and upscaling. In spite of the uncertainty inherent in LCA, the system is presented as an interesting option to produce renewable methanol while contributing towards a circular economy, provided that the economic performance is also beneficial relative to the fossil alternative. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Spent Coffee Grounds worldwide production is estimated at around 6 M tons only at industrial level. The abundance and the heterogeneity of this substrate make it an ideal substrate for a biorefinery approach based on the “cascade biorefinery hierarchy”. Currently, the major part of spent coffee grounds is sent to incineration and landfill disposal, options which should be avoided. Instead, they could be valorised through biofuels production. All the operational parameters leading to the highest biogas (350-400LCH4/kgTVS), bioethanol (3–4%v/v) and biodiesel (over 90% of Fatty Acid Methyl Esters concentration) yields from spent coffee grounds have been discussed in this review paper. They are rich in an oil phase containing different added-value molecules (tocopherols, cafestol, kahweol along with linoleic and palmitic acids), which can be extracted and used as additives for food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications. Solid/liquid extraction techniques of coffee oil from spent coffee grounds such as the most common Soxhlet technique and the more innovative fluids in supercritical conditions have been discussed, with coffee oil recovery of around 5–15%w/w and 15–20%w/w, respectively. The most recent applications of the extracted coffee oil have been also presented: the added-value molecules recovery and purification after micro/ultra and nano filtrations processes and the polyhydroxyalkanoates (0.84 g/g) and biosurfactants (3.5 g/L) production. Considering the whole information, an integrated biorefinery scheme, along with the respective mass balances were proposed. The novelty of this paper lies in the integration of the state-of-the-art data, in a biorefinery concept that would allow the production of both biofuels and value-added products. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study evaluated the sequential biodiesel-bioethanol production from seaweeds. A total of 22 macroalgal species were collected at different seasons and screened based on lipid and carbohydrate contents as well as biomass production. The promising species was selected, based on the relative increase in energy compounds (REEC, %), for further energy conversion. Seasonal and annual biomass yields of the studied species showed significant variations. The rhodophyte Amphiroa compressa and the chlorophyte Ulva intestinalis showed the highest annual biomass yield of 75.2 and 61.5 g m−2 year−1, respectively. However, the highest annual carbohydrate productivity (ACP) and annual lipid productivity (ALP) were recorded for Ulva fasciata and Ulva intestinalis (17.0 and 3.0 g m−2 year−1, respectively). The later was selected for further studies because it showed 14.8% higher REEC value than Ulva fasciata. Saturated fatty acids (SAFs) showed 73.4%, with palmitic acid as a dominant fatty acid (43.8%). Therefore, biodiesel showed high saturation degree, with average degree of unsaturation (ADU) of 0.508. All the measured biodiesel characteristics complied the international standards. The first route of biodiesel production (R1) from Ulva intestinalis showed biodiesel recovery of 32.3 mg g−1 dw. The hydrolysate obtained after saccharification of the whole biomass (R2) and lipid-free biomass (R3) contained 1.22 and 1.15 g L−1, respectively, reducing sugars. However, bioethanol yield from R3 was 0.081 g g−1 dw, which represented 14.1% higher than that of R2. Therefore, application of sequential biofuel production using R3 resulted in gross energy output of 3.44 GJ ton−1 dw, which was 170.9% and 82.0% higher than R1 and R2, respectively. The present study recommended the naturally-grown Ulva intestinalis as a potential feedstock for enhanced energy recovery through sequential biodiesel-bioethanol production. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In the agriculture and transportation sector, many bio-seed based biofuels have exposed to be a better replacement for fuels derivative from fossil fuels. In the Indian context, due to the energy needs, agricultural growth, surrounding degradation and rural development these biofuels have achieved an acknowledgment as an alternative. Biofuels derived from the bio seeds such as rubber seed oil, cottonseed oil, jatropha and rapeseed oil etc. can hold the carbon emissions from vehicles in an efficient and economical method. In this research paper, an attempt has been made with blends from bio-seed based Sapindus seed oil with nano additive as an alternative for diesel. Its performance and emission characteristics were investigated on the constant speed single cylinder CI engine and results were compared. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The efficient transformation of biomass resources to biofuels has attracted much attention. Herein, ordered mesoporous alumina supported nickel-molybdenum sulfide catalysts (denoted as Ni-MoS2/mAl2O3) were prepared by evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) method and used for the hydrogenolysis of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF). Under mild conditions (130 °C, 1 MPa H2), the 5Ni-7MoS2/mAl2O3 catalyst achieved 95 % yield of DMF. The results of characterizations and DFT calculation showed that the active center was proposed to the coordinated unsaturated site (CUS) located at S-edge. And the intrinsic activity of CUS was directly related to the proportion of Mo substituted by Ni. The 5Ni-7MoS2/mAl2O3 catalyst containing CUS with high proportions of Ni replacing Mo showed higher TOF and lower apparent activated energy. Besides, 2-propanol can cooperate with molecular hydrogen to improve DMF yield by forming ethers that were easier to be hydrogenolyzed. The present findings provided a new catalytic system for converting HMF to DMF. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A synergistic effect of the activated limestone-based catalyst (LBC) and microwave irradiation on the transesterification of waste cooking oil (WCO) was screened using a two-level factorial design and response surface methodology. The catalyst was prepared using a wet-impregnation method and was characterised for its surface element, surface morphology, surface area and porosity. The reaction was performed in a purpose-built continuous microwave assisted reactor (CMAR), while the conversion and yield of biodiesel were measured using a gas chromatography. The results showed that the catalyst loading, methanol to oil molar ratio and the reaction time significantly affect the WCO conversion. The optimum conversion of oil to biodiesel up to 96.65% was achieved at catalyst loading of 5.47 wt%, methanol to oil molar ratio of 12.21:1 and the reaction time of 55.26 min. The application of CMAR in this work reduced the transesterification time by about 77% compared to the reaction time needed for a conventional reactor. The biodiesel produced in this work met the specification of American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM D6751). Engine test results shows the biodiesel has a lower NOx and particulate matters emissions compared to petrodiesel. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The objective of this paper was to optimize, by composite central design coupled to response surface methodology, the enzymatic biodiesel production from oil coming from fish waste, and to characterize the obtained product. The lipase from Thermomyces lanuginosus immobilized on octadecyl metacrylate beads was used as biocatalyst. Optimal conditions were temperature of 35 °C, 10% w/w of biocatalyst content and 216 rpm of agitation rate. Under optimal conditions, an experimental biodiesel yield of 75.3% was obtained after 24 h of reaction time. The biodiesel presented an acid value (0.9 ± 0.28 mg KOH/g) that was higher than the established limits, while other parameters like density (0.89 ± 0.01 g/mL), viscosity (5.3 ± 0.004 mm2/s), calorific value (38.1 ± 0.21 MJ/kg) and cloud point (10.5 ± 0.47 °C), complied with the recommendations of the ASTM D6751 standard. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To achieve ultra-high efficiency and low emissions over the full engine operating range, the intelligent charge compression ignition (ICCI) combustion mode was firstly proposed. In ICCI mode, by real-time control over the injection strategies of two independent direct injection systems (including fuel proportions, injection pressure, timing and duration), the concentration and reactivity stratifications of the air-fuel mixture can be flexibly adjusted. Therefore, in this paper, an experimental study was conducted on a single cylinder diesel engine to research the working mechanism of ICCI mode fueled with biodiesel and n-butanol. Experimental results showed that, the n-butanol/biodiesel ICCI combustion mode had great potential to improve engine efficiency and reduce its emissions. At medium load, the early biodiesel injection timing (SOI2) can shorten the combustion duration and improve the indicated thermal efficiency (ITE), and the maximum ITE can reach 50.7%. As the butanol energy ratio increased, the nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions could be reduced due to the reduction of local high temperature, while NOx emissions were always at low level and it can meet Euro 6 emission standards. The butanol injection pressure had significant effect on the combustion and emission characteristics of the ICCI mode, properly increasing the butanol injection pressure can improve the ITE and reduce emissions, however, excessive butanol injection pressure deteriorates the combustion process, increased the hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions. In general, the butanol-biodiesel ICCI mode can achieve stable combustion under different loads while ensuring high efficiency and ultra-low emissions with a single injection of biodiesel at low/medium loads and two injections of biodiesel at high load. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The strong new restrictions in the vehicle CO2 emissions together with the instability of the fossil fuels reserves reinforces the necessity to continue developing high efficiency combustion engines that operate with renewable energy sources. Bio-ethanol appears as a potential fuel to replace well-established fossil fuels, such as gasoline, due to the overall carbon neutral emission. In addition, the high-octane number allows to increase the compression ratio of the engine to improve the thermal efficiency. Apart from the CO2, the emissions legislation restricts the NOx and particle matter emissions to ultra-low values, and they will continue decreasing down to almost zero. In this work, two advanced dual-fuel combustion modes using bio-ethanol as main fuel are studied. A pre-chamber ignition system (PCIS) using bio-ethanol and hydrogen, and a reactivity-controlled compression ignition (RCCI) combustion mode operating with bio-ethanol/diesel was selected due to the potential to reduce NOx emissions. These combustion technologies were studied by a numerical 0-D vehicle simulations in homologation and real-life driving cycles for a range extender hybrid powertrain. As a baseline, the original manufacturer spark ignition (SI) no-hybrid powertrain fueled with pure bio-ethanol was used. The powertrain components and control system were optimized to obtain the maximum overall vehicle efficiency, and low CO2-NOx emissions. Finally, a life cycle analysis (LCA) was performed to study the global potential of the bio-ethanol to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. A battery electric vehicle (BEV) and a gasoline SI no-hybrid vehicle were added for comparison. The results show that the RCCI mode presents the highest potential to reduce the NOx emissions. However, the PCIS allows to reduce the tank to wheel CO2 emissions up to 60 g/km when high rates of H2 are used. The LCA-GHG for the vehicles using bio-ethanol is 50% and 95% lower than a BEV and SI-gasoline vehicle, respectively. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study was aimed at environmentally analyzing an ultrasound-assisted system converting waste cooking oil (WCO) into biodiesel in order to make decisions on its operating conditions. Twenty-seven different experiments (scenarios) carried out at three levels of methanol content, methanolysis temperature, and reaction duration, were compared from environmental viewpoint using the Impact 2002 + life cycle impact assessment approach. The effects of different scenarios on four endpoint impact categories including human health, ecosystem quality, climate change, and resource consumption were quantitatively evaluated and comprehensively discussed. The effects of material and energy flows on the endpoint impact categories were also appraised through a sensitivity analysis. Overall, the experimental variables profoundly affected all the endpoint impact categories considered herein. Methanol content exhibited the highest influence on the studied impact categories, while methanolysis temperature showed the lowest impact on these environmental indices. Overall, methanol:oil molar ratio of 6:1, methanolysis temperature of 60 °C, and reaction duration of 10 min could be recommend as the most suitable operating conditions from both technical and environmental perspectives. The environmental impacts of biodiesel produced at the selected conditions were significantly lower than those of the conventional fossil-based diesel fuel. The sensitivity analysis showed that the electrical power utilized in the process was the most influential impact on the human health and climate change damage categories. The phosphoric acid utilized for neutralizing crude glycerol was the most effective input on the ecosystem quality damage category, while the methanol consumed in the process significantly affected the resource consumption damage category. The outcomes of this study revealed that LCA approach could offer relevant environmental impact indices supporting decision-making on the development of sustainable biodiesel production systems and on the identification of their optimal operating conditions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of this study is to optimize Organosolv pretreatment parameters for efficient lignin removal and polysaccharide release using response surface methodology based on central composite design. Organosolv pretreatment conditions (60–100 °C, 10–50 min and 50–90% acid concentration) were tested for maximum cellulose release and lignin solubilization and minimum hemicellulose decomposition. The optimum Organosolv pretreatment condition was achieved at an acid concentration of 69.85%, pretreatment time 29.68 min and pretreatment temperature of 75.41 °C. At optimal condition, 73.17% of lignin and 46.62% hemicellulose were solubilized, and 74.09% of cellulose was released. The high R squared and adjusted R squared values of 0.9801 and 0.9622 for lignin removal, 0.9831 and 0.9695 for cellulose released and 0.9851 and 0.9717 for hemicellulose solubilization shows that the quadratic models are adequate and the experimental data adequately fitted to the design model. Moreover, all the process parameters: temperature, time and concentration have a significant impact on the responses (disruption or depolymerization of rice straw biomass) where time had a very strong effect on the rice straw components (cellulose, lignin, and hemicellulose). The study demonstrated that the potential of the combination of Organosolv pretreatment and Bacillus sp. BMP01 hydrolysis of rice straw for enhancing sugar and ethanol yields. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In recent years, added nano-catalysts to fuels has improved their thermo-physical properties. In present study, the alumina as additive with concentrations of 30, 60, and 90 ppm were added to B5 and B10 blends for evaluation of the engine performance, emissions, and vibration levels. An ANN model based on standard back-propagation learning algorithm for the engine was developed. Multi-layer perception network (MLP) was used for a non-linear mapping between the input and target parameters. The input or independent parameters were fuel blend, engine speed, fuel density, fuel viscosity, LHV, intake manifold pressure, fuel consumption, exhaust gas temperature, oxygen contained in exhaust gases, oil temperature, relative humidity, and ambient air pressure. Whereas, the target parameters separately were engine power, torque, emissions of CO, CO2, UHC, NO, RMS and Kurtosis of engine's vibration. The results for optimum ANN model showed, the training algorithm of back-propagation with 25-25 neurons in hidden layers (logsig-logsig) is able to predict different parameters of engine for different conditions. The corresponding R-values for training, validation and testing were 0.9999, 0.9994 and 0.9995, respectively. The performance and accuracy of the proposed ANN model was completely satisfactory. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The production of biodiesel using vegetable oil is an effective way to meet growing energy demands, which could potentially reduce the dependency on fossil fuels. The aim of this study was to evaluate grape seed (Vitis vinifera), Philippine tung (Reutealis trisperma), and kesambi (Schleichera oleosa) oils as potential feedstocks for biodiesel production to meet this demand. Firstly, biodiesels from these oils were produced and then their fatty acid methyl ester profiles and physicochemical properties were evaluated and compared with palm biodiesel. The results showed that the biodiesel produced from grape seed oil possessed the highest oxidation stability of 4.62 h. On the other hand, poor oxidation stability was observed for Philippine tung biodiesel at 2.47 h. The poor properties of Philippine tung biodiesel can be attributed to the presence of α-elaeostearic fatty acid. Furthermore, synthetic antioxidants (pyrogallol) and diesel were used to improve the oxidation stability. The 0.2 wt.% concentration of pyrogallol antioxidant could increase the oxidation stability of grape seed biodiesel to 6.24 h, while for kesambi and Philippine tung, biodiesels at higher concentrations of 0.3% and 0.4 wt.%, respectively, were needed to meet the minimum limit of 8 h. The blending of biodiesel with fossil diesel at different ratios can also increase the oxidation stability. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The utilization of non-edible and low-cost feedstock in bioenergy research is getting more attention in recent decades. Catalytic deoxygenation of fatty acids from waste oil feedstocks is a promising route to produce diesel-like hydrocarbons. Here we report the conversion of palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD), a low-value side product of physical refining of crude palm oil, into green diesel using a solventless and hydrogen-free deoxygenation (DO) reaction using catalytic deoxygenation over solid acid catalysts (Co/SBA-15, Ni/SBA-15, and Ni–Co/SBA-15) with total metal loadings of 5 wt%. Metal precursors (Ni, Co, Ni–Co) were doped on the mesostructured catalyst supporter, SBA-15 by wet impregnation. The catalysts were characterized by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm analysis, X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, infrared spectroscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy with elemental mapping. The DO reaction was carried out in a semi-batch reactor with a catalyst loading of 10 wt% at 350 °C for 3 h. The use of both Ni/SBA-15 and Ni–Co/SBA-15 afforded products with high contents of liquid hydrocarbons (C8–C17) with yields of 85.8% and 88.1%, respectively, and selectivity for diesel-range hydrocarbons (C13–C17) above 85% were achieved. Cobalt seems to have a larger particle size, then associates with the carbon formation and introduces coke formation. It blocks some pores and deactivates the active sites of the catalyst, thus reducing the catalytic activity. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The conversion of algal lipids to fatty acid alkyl esters is a promising way for the production of high-grade biofuel, due to the lower oxygen content of lipids than that of saccharides and proteins. Herein, a catalyst-free conversion process of natural microalgae cyanobacteria was developed for biodiesel production. The conversion involved two steps: (1) pretreatment of raw microalgae by Soxhlet extraction of lipids or hydrothermal treatment for extraction of saccharides and part of proteins at 200 °C; (2) liquefaction of raw and pretreated samples in sub/supercritical ethanol. In the first step, a maximum lipid yield of 6.5 wt% was extracted by Soxhlet extraction, while the hydrothermal treatment dissolved saccharides and a part of proteins. The composition of biocrude obtained from raw algae was complex, containing hydrocarbons, N-containing compounds, esters, fatty acids and other oxy-compounds. The biocrude from lipid extracted algae had a poor quality, from which the degradation of proteins was facilitated. Better yet, the extraction of saccharides and part of proteins by hydrothermal pretreatment simplified the composition (mainly fatty acid ethyl esters), reduced the nitrogen content (&lt;4%) and improved the higher heating value (∼41 MJ kg−1) for biocrude. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The industrialization of integrated algae-aquaculture systems entails appropriate information regarding environmental and economic assessments, field and laboratory analyses, and feasibility studies. Accordingly, Scenedesmus obliquus was cultivated in a raceway pond (300 m3), and the algal biomass was used as a protein source for the growth of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Nile tilapia fish was cultivated in five commercial-scale tanks for 44 weeks, having a productivity of 15–20 kg (live weight)·m−3. Among various algal-based fish meals, the diet containing 7.5% microalgae provided the largest body length (29 cm) and weight (402 g), as well as the optimum growth performance parameters. Scenedesmus obliquus was subjected to lipid extraction, and the defatted biomass was also used as a substitute for fishmeal in diets. Nile tilapia grown using the lipid-extracted algae had improved health status, and the biochemical composition was satisfactory. Further, two scenarios were economically investigated: Case 1, the direct use of algal biomass for fish production, and Case 2, the utilization of algae for biodiesel production followed by the application of residual biomass in fishmeal diets. Based on field experiments and financial information reported in the literature, the two options would offset their initial investment cost within payback periods of 7.5 and 6.8 yr, respectively. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, cost simulations were made based on 20 million L blended biodiesel B-10 production per year using INRS and conventional process. In case of INRS process, microbial lipid was produced by T. oleaginosus using washed municipal secondary sludge fortified with crude glycerol while lipid was extracted from wet biomass using biodegradable surfactant and petroleum-diesel (PD). The conventional process uses commercial substrates for lipid production and organic solvents for lipid extraction from dry biomass. The unit B-10 production cost of INRS process was estimated to be $ 0.72/L for an annual capacity of 20 million L, which is 9.5 times more economical than conventional biodiesel production process. For INRS process, the unit B-10 biodiesel production cost was sensitive to plant capacity and lipid productivity during the fermentation. INRS process exhibited positive net energy gain and positive GHG capture, which proves to be energetically and environmentally viable. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present study, the effect of ultrasound irradiation on the transesterification parameters, biodiesel properties, and its combustion profiles in the diesel engine was investigated. Moreover, date seed oil (DSO) was firstly utilized in the ultrasound-assisted transesterification reaction. DSO was extracted from Zahidi type date (Phoenix dactylifera) and was esterified to reduce its Free Fatty Acid (FFA) content. Biodiesel yield was optimized in both heating methods, so that the yield of 96.4% (containing 93.5% ester) at 60 °C, with 6 M ratio of methanol/oil, 1 wt% of catalyst (NaOH) and at 90 min of reaction time was reported. The ultrasound irradiation did not influence the reaction conditions except reaction time, reduced to 5 min (96.9% yield and 91.9% ester). The ultrasonic irradiation also influenced on the physicochemical properties of DSO biodiesel and improved its combustion in the diesel engine. The analysis results related to the engine and gas emission confirmed that the ultrasound-assisted produced biodiesel has lower density and viscosity, and higher oxygen content facilitating injection of fuel in the engine chamber and its combustion, respectively. Although, B40 (biodiesel blend consisting of 40% biodiesel and 60% net diesel fuel) as a blend of both fuels presented higher CO2 and lower CO and HC in the emissions, the DSO biodiesel produced by ultrasound irradiation presented better specifications (caused about 2-fold improvement in emissions than that of conventional method). The findings of the study confirmed the positive effect of the ultrasound irradiation on the properties of the produced biodiesel along with its combustion properties in the diesel engine, consequently reducing air pollution problems. © 2019

AB  - Biodiesel is a very promising alternative fuel that has its place in the future energy mix. The dependence of fuel properties on fatty acids profile will influence the choice of feedstock or appropriate treatment that it should undergo in order to respect biodiesel standards. The objective of this study is to find models that predict biodiesel's viscosity, density, flash point, higher heating value, and oxidative stability based on saponification value, Iodine value and the polyunsaturated fatty acids content of feedstock. Biodiesel samples were produced from seventeen different blends of oils. Multiple linear regressions were used to obtain models. High accuracy prediction was obtained for density and higher heating value with prediction errors <5%, a very good accuracy was obtained for viscosity with error <10% and flash point and oxidative stability were predicted with a fair accuracies (error < 15%) which indicates a good correlation level with IV, SV and Polyinsaturations but it also reveals that other parameters could also interfere and should be taken in consideration to reach acceptable accuracy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An organized approach has been made in this research to assess the diesel engine behaviour by fuelling novel biofuel. The unique and non-toxic, renewable citronella biofuel is extracted by steam distillation process. Moreover, extracted citronella oil exhibits similar viscosity to diesel. In this analysis, gas chromatography-mass spectrograph (GC–MS) and Fourier infrared (FT-IR) techniques were employed to characterize the chemical composition of citronella oil. The test fuel was prepared by mixing several blend ratios of citronella oil, which has been intermixed with diesel by volume basis, namely B20, B40, and B60. Its properties were appraised according to material standards. The test fuels were examined on a mono-cylinder conventional diesel engine. From the experimental exploration, it has been observed that citronella oil can succeed up to 20% at the top load condition in that order. Appreciably, the tailpipe Smoke emission has been reduced by 31% than a standard diesel operating mode, with a minor increase in oxides of nitrogen (NOX) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission by 12.5% and 7.1%. Besides that, carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) are 16.34% and 22.2% lesser than regular diesel fuel mode at the peak load condition. The BTE of citronella oil, along with its blend, exhibits minimal values when correlated with diesel fuel along with several combinations B20 blend, had better efficiency. The B20 (20% Citronella oil + 80% Diesel) claimed 1.47% lower in engine BTE and 2.7% higher fuel consumption than a diesel engine. The combustion analysis reported that citronella fuel had significant improvement in-cylinder pressure (CP), exhaust gas temperature (EGT), and heat release rate (HRR) with considerable reduction in ignition delay (ID). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biomass-based feedstock is an attractive alternative to fossil fuel due to its sustainability and potential as a clean energy source. The present work focuses on the valorisation of horse manure biowaste to produce bioenergy via microwave-assisted pyrolysis technique. The thermal decomposition process is conducted by considering the effects of pyrolysis temperature, catalyst loading and carrier gas flow rate on the yield and quality of end products. The pyrolysed gaseous product contains up to 73.1 vol% of syngas components. The solid biochar obtained contains a heating value of 35.5 MJ/kg with high surface to pore volume ratio. The relatively high specific energy contents of gaseous products and biochar indicate their potential as biofuels. The liquid product is found to contain oxygenated phenolic compound of up to 79.4 wt%. In spite of an overall energy deficit achieved when comparing the total energy of end products with the feedstock, the energy balance analysis indicates the optimum production parameters. The least energy deficit is achieved at the reactive conditions of 350–450 °C and manure-to-catalyst ratio of 1:1. A reaction mechanism pathway for the pyrolysis of horse manure is presented to show the production route for bioenergy and valuable chemicals. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work studied the hydrothermal liquefaction of rice husk (RH) and cow dung (CD) for the production of biochar from RH and CD and use of that biochar for the removal of dye from textile industry effluent. These biomasses were subjected to fast pyrolysis (500 °C), which yielded biochar (22.8 and 29.8%) and bio-oil (60.4 and 57.3%) from RH and CD, respectively. Biochar was characterized based on spectroscopy Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and morphological studies like Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and SEM-EDS. Further, bio-oil samples were characterized by GC–MS into saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, carboxylic acids, phenolics and aromatic hydrocarbons. The removal efficiencies of the Congo red dye from prepared biochar in a batch experiment were 66.8–96.9%(RH) and 68.9–98.8%(CD). The adsorption isotherms for Langmuir (R2 = 0.977 and 0.902) and Freundlich (R2 0.842 and 0.883) were calculated for RH and CD biochar, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The rapid depletion of natural oil resources and growing environmental problems has led to the hunt for a cost-efficient method for production of fuel-grade Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). The supremacy of heterogeneous catalysis urges the development of bio-based catalyst as an alternative to the previously used catalyst. The present study elevates the practicability of utilizing residual ash from sugarcane leaves as a catalyst for the production of Calophyllum inophyllum methyl esters. XRD, SEM, FT-IR were used to characterize the residual ash. Central Composite design based response surface methodology was employed to study the relationship between process parameters on FAME yield.

AB  - The depletion of fossil fuels and their serious environmental concerns have made renewable energy sources much more attractive. One of the more promising renewable energy alternatives is the use of second/third-generation biomass that does not endanger food security, to produce bioenergy. The biomass-to-bioenergy supply chain design is a challenging issue that has attracted the attention of academic and industrial research. In this direction, a multi-objective multi-period MILP model is developed to design the second/third-generation biofuel supply chain using anaerobic digestion and transesterification processes. Three types of biomass (i.e. agricultural residues and livestock manure, microalgae and Jatropha) simultaneously are studied as feedstock to produce clean energy in all climatic and geographic conditions, and even in remote areas. Selection of raw material resources, location of production facilities, location of warehouses, and optimal material flows are the main decisions made by the proposed model to minimize the total cost and maximize the produced energy. The performance of this model is evaluated and validated through conducting a real case study. The results show that considering the amount of produced bioenergy regardless to its type, energy production from microalgae and Jatropha is more viable than bio-wastes. The results also show that production cost (especially biodiesel production cost from Jatropha) and investment cost (especially construction costs of microalgae and Jatropha to biodiesel production sites) have the most effect on the total cost of the supply chain network, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Magnetic microfuel-reforming is a promising method of biofuel processing in diesel engines. However, the complex interactions amongst the non-Newtonian biofuel flow, magnetic field and reactor have hindered understanding of their influences upon the transport phenomena in the system. To resolve this issue, the transport of heat and mass in a porous microreactor containing a Casson rheological fluid and subject to a magnetic field is investigated analytically. The system is assumed to host a homogenous and uniformly distributed endothermic/exothermic chemical reaction. Two-dimensional analytical solutions are developed for the temperature and concentration fields as well as the Nusselt number and local entropy generations, and the results are rigorously validated. It is demonstrated that changes in the non-Newtonian characteristics of the fluid and altering the magnetic and thermal radiation properties can lead to bifurcation of temperature gradient on the surface of the porous medium. The general behaviour of such bifurcation is dominated by the exothermicity (or endothermicity) of the chemical reaction in the fluid phase. It is also shown that variations in the Casson fluid parameter and changes in the intensity and incident angle of the magnetic field can modify the Nusselt number considerably. The extent of these modifications is found to be heavily dependent upon the wall thickness and diminishes as the walls become thicker. Further, the total entropy generation is shown to be highly sensitive to the wall thickness and increases by intensifying the magnetic field, provided that the microreactor walls are thin. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - In this study, engine tests lead the studies on using diesel fuel (ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel, ULSD), soy-based biodiesel and diesel blends. Performance, combustion and exhaust emission values obtained as ULSD and biofuel blends are presented under load of 3.6 kW, 7.2 kW and 10.8 kW and constant engine speed of 1500 rpm in a diesel engine power generator and compared with ULSD. The maximum increment in break specific fuel consumption (BSFC) is observed at 3.6 kW with SOB20 fuel as about 8% compared to ULSD. Although the BSFC of soy-based biodiesel is high on low loads compared to the ULSD, both types of fuel gave almost identical results. The maximum increment of BTE compared to diesel fuel is occurred as 3.1% when the engine fueled with SOB20 fuel at 10.8 kW. All biodiesel blends are almost the same efficiency as diesel however, when the load increased from 3.6 kW to 10.8 kW, the HC values of ULSD, SOB5 and SOB20 are increased by 28%, 26% and 6%, respectively. However, experimental results show that using biodiesel blends partly similar to ULSD operation in diesel engine according to cylinder gas pressure, heat release rate, heat release rate, knock density and AGT. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In order to reveal the mechanism of high thermal efficiency of diesel methanol dual fuel (DMDF) engine, the exergy loss of DMDF engine under different operating parameters is investigated by using experimental and calculative methods based on the second law of thermodynamics. It has been found that DMDF has lower heat transfer exergy loss under all engine loads due to the high latent heat of vaporization of methanol which reduces the temperature in-cylinder. The exhaust exergy loss of DMDF under high load is relatively low compared with that of pure diesel fuel, while it is opposite to that under medium-low load. This is due to the influence of different temperatures on the incomplete combustion of methanol, which also indicates the main cause for the high thermal efficiency of DMDF under high load. Then studies on exergy analysis of DMDF under different temperatures were carried out. The studies covers the effect of intake air temperature on exergy efficiency, the heat transfer exergy loss and the exhaust physical exergy loss increase with rising intake air temperature as well. The results shows that the exhaust chemical exergy loss decreases significantly with the increase of intake air temperature and higher intake air temperature helps to improve exergy efficiency. Additionally, it is concluded that higher methanol temperature and cooling water temperature can improve exergy efficiency by decreasing exhaust exergy loss and combustion irreversible exergy loss. Finally, some feasible measures are proposed to further improve DMDF engine's performance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this research, the effectiveness of ultrasonic transesterification in situ was appraised with the aim of biodiesel synthesis from almonds of Syagrus cearensis, commonly known as Catolé. This raw material was investigated as an innovative and non-conventional alternative for biodiesel production. S. cearensis appears in this article as an energy source with valuable sustainable factors, allowing for financial savings and low environmental impact compared to fossil fuels. Influences of ultrasonic energy on different process variable were elucidated. An experimental design was applied, employing 4 main factors (type and proportion of catalyst, the proportion of methanol and reaction time) to evaluate the effect of the process variables and determine the optimal conditions for biodiesel production. The present study revealed two main factors interactions, ratio, and type of catalyst, which had significant effects on the ultrasonic-assisted in situ transesterification based on statistical evaluation. The results indicated as optimal conditions: basic catalyst (KOH), 5 wt % catalyst, 1:6 methanol: oil (molar ratio) and reaction time of 30 (min). Besides, a kinetic study exposed that the ultrasonic assistance in situ transesterification reaction complies properly with first-order kinetics and activation energy of 27.53 kJ.mol-1. Yields of up to 99.99% conversion to biodiesel were achieved in the present study. By the results, it is possible to affirm that the in situ transesterification of S. cearensis almonds associated with the ultrasound technique was effective for the production of biodiesel proving the benefit of utilizing S. cearensis a new feedstock for biofuels production in Brazil. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Spent Coffee Ground (SCG) was studied as a potential source of oil feedstock for biodiesel production as an alternative waste utilisation instead of being disposed as municipal waste. This study evaluated the ultrasonic assisted oil extraction from SCG, which was followed by biodiesel conversion via transesterification. Hexane was found to be the most effective extractant for SCG oil. Soxhlet extraction could obtain maximum SCG oil yield of 12.5% within 3 h whereas the highest SCG oil yield (14.52%) using ultrasonic extraction was obtained at hexane to SCG ratio of 4 mL g−1 and at 30% ultrasonic amplitude for 30 min. The improved oil yield with shorter extraction time was due to the ultrasonic fragmentation on SCG cells, which enhanced the interactions between oil and solvents. Fourier transform infrared analysis showed that the SCG oil possessed suitable functional groups for biodiesel conversion. Then, the SCG oil was successfully converted to biodiesel via ultrasonic assisted transesterification. The optimal FAME yield (97.11%) was achieved with molar ratio of methanol to SCG oil of 30:1, 4 wt% of catalyst concentration, at 30% ultrasonic amplitude and for 3 h. The produced SCG biodiesel has promising properties which adhere to the biodiesel standards but acid value was beyond the permissible limit which could be overcome by utilising as blend feedstock with other commercially available biodiesel. The high calorific value along with low viscosity, density and corrosion properties suggested SCG biodiesel as an interesting and viable option for biodiesel blending. © 2019

AB  - Biodiesel production via esterification/transesterification reactions can be catalyzed by homogenous or heterogeneous catalysts. Development of heterogeneous catalysts for biodiesel production is highly advantageous due to the ease of product purification and of catalyst recyclability. In this current work, a novel acidic [DABCODBS][CF3SO3]2 dicationic ionic liquid (DIL) was used as heterogeneous catalyst to produce biodiesel using oleic acid as model oil. The esterification was conducted under ultrasonic irradiation (20 kHz) using a 14 mm ultrasonic horn transducer operated at various duty cycles. It was observed that the duty cycle, amplitude, methanol to oil molar ratio, catalyst amount and reaction temperature were the major factors that greatly impact the necessary reaction time to lead to a high yield of biodiesel. The reaction conditions were optimized with the aid of Response Surface Methodology (RSM) designed according to the Quadratic model of the Box Behnken method. The optimum conditions were found to be at catalyst amount of 0.64 mol%, methanol to oil ratio of 14.3:1, temperature of 59 °C, reaction time of 83 min and amplitude of 60% in continuous mode. The results showed that the oleic acid was successfully converted into esters with conversion value of 93.20% together with significant reduction of reaction time from 7 h (using mechanical stirring) to 83 min (using ultrasonication). The results also showed that the acidic DIL catalyst we designed purposely was efficient to catalyze the ultrasonic-assisted esterification yielding high conversion of oleic acid to methyl oleate on short times. The DIL was also recycled and reused for at least five times without significant reduction in performance. Overall, the procedure offers advantages including short reaction time, good yield, operational simplicity and environmentally benign characteristics. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Experiments were conducted on a 4 stroke two cylinder, CRDI diesel engine running at a constant speed of 2000 rpm for lower load and higher load. Test fuels were prepared by blending the 1-pentanol with diesel, and tests were carried out for 5%, 10%, 20%, 30% and 40%, 1-pentanol blended in diesel on a volume basis. Effect of EGR rates of 10% and 20% were also studied. It had observed that engine can be run up to 30% of 1-pentanol blended fuel without any engine modification, but with raise in the percentage of 1-pentanol in the blends, BSFC increases and BTE decreases. Combustion characteristic for blended fuel depends upon the load. At higher load due to premixed combustion MGT, CP and NHR were almost same compared to the diesel. Reduction in NOx emissions was noted for all the fuel blends at the cost of HC and CO emission. 1-pentanol is a renewable biofuel, with use of 1-pentanol the dependency on petrodiesel can be overcome. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Yarrowia lipolytica is an oleaginous yeast that has been substantially engineered for production of oleochemicals and drop-in transportation fuels. The unique acetyl-CoA/malonyl-CoA supply mode along with the versatile carbon-utilization pathways makes this yeast a superior host to upgrade low-value carbons into high-value secondary metabolites and fatty acid-based chemicals. The expanded synthetic biology toolkits enabled us to explore a large portfolio of specialized metabolism beyond fatty acids and lipid-based chemicals. In this review, we will summarize the recent advances in genetic, omics, and computational tool development that enables us to streamline the genetic or genomic modification for Y. lipolytica. We will also summarize various metabolic engineering strategies to harness the endogenous acetyl-CoA/malonyl-CoA/HMG-CoA pathway for production of complex oleochemicals, polyols, terpenes, polyketides, and commodity chemicals. We envision that Y. lipolytica will be an excellent microbial chassis to expand nature’s biosynthetic capacity to produce plant secondary metabolites, industrially relevant oleochemicals, agrochemicals, commodity, and specialty chemicals and empower us to build a sustainable biorefinery platform that contributes to the prosperity of a bio-based economy in the future. © 2020, Society for Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology.

AB  - Rapid depletion of petroleum resources, surge in fuel prices and stringent emission norms play a key role on economic development of a country like India in terms of energy efficiency, which attracts the researchers to search for novel alternative fuel for diesel. The work reported here focuses on the effect of various oxygenated additives such as diethyl ether, dimethyl ether and dimethyl carbonate to 20% tamarind seed methyl ester (TSME 20) biodiesel blend of different concentrations (6% and 12%) on volume basis to examine engine characteristics. The test results revealed that 12% diethyl ether added TSME20 is shown considerable enhancement in brake thermal efficiency, which is 4.22% higher over tamarind biodiesel blend. Similarly, TSME20 DEE 12 has shown significant reductions in harmful engine tailpipe emissions such as carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, oxides of nitrogen and smoke opacity which are noted to be about 10.68%, 33.33%, 10.33% and 27.72% respectively when compared to diesel fuel at full load. Further, the DIESEL-RK theoretical simulation results are compared with the experimental values, conducted at the same operating conditions and it is inferred that 12% diethyl ether addition to TSME 20 has shown promising engine characteristics both experimentally and theoretically. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper investigates use of artificial neural network (ANN) model in prediction of brake specific energy consumption (BSEC), nitrogen oxides (NOx), unburnt hydrocarbon (UHC), and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of a single cylinder diesel engine operates with diesel-palm biodiesel-ethanol blends. The engine is run at different load form 20–100% and 1500 rpm constant speed. The fuel used in this present study are diesel and six different diesel-palm biodiesel-ethanol blends. The Levenberg-Marquardt back propagation training algorithm with logistic-sigmoid activation function results best prediction of performance and emission characteristics with accurate overall correlation coefficient (R) (0.99329–0.99875) and minimum mean square error (MSE) (0.000179082–0.000465809). The mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) are observed to be in range of 2.32–4.54% with the acceptable margin of mean square relative error (MSRE). Furthermore, experimental and ANN predicted data are compared in fuzzy interface system (FIS) to find optimum engine operating parameters. Compared to other blends, at 20% load, D85BD10E5 blend exhibits the highest MPCI (multi performance characteristics index) values of 0.718 and 0.705 for experimental and ANN predicted data respectively. Robustness and reliability of the proposed techniques clearly explain the application of ANN and fuzzy logic system in the prediction and optimization of engine parameters. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The common regulatory approach for managing ground-level ozone (O3) formation is based upon reducing the emission of total VOC in VOC limited regions, and the emission of NOx in NOx limited regions. However, the characteristic VOC species emitted from different sources are of different ozone formation potentials (OFP). Without an in-depth understanding of the relative OFP contributions from specific sources, the effectiveness of the existing approach for controlling ground-level O3 at the regional scale is limited. This study collected and analyzed five years (2012–2016) of monitoring data for 56 most photochemically reactive VOC species at Port Moody, an industrial city in Metro Vancouver, Canada that has experienced elevated O3 levels in its ambience. Source-specific contributions to OFP were quantified for major VOC emitters to deliberate the underlying causes of elevated O3 recently observed in this populated region. Six sources were identified using the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model, consisting of fuel production and combustion, fuel evaporation, vehicle exhaust, industrial coatings/solvents, petrochemical source, and other industrial emission. Although the top three contributors to total VOCs are fuel production and combustion (34.5%), fuel evaporation (21.4%), and vehicle exhaust (20.6%), the top three contributors to OFP are fuel production and combustion (27.1%), vehicle exhaust (23.7%), and industrial coatings/solvents (17.2%). Additionally, potential source contribution function (PSCF) analysis was conducted to generate the geographical distribution of VOC and OFP sources in different seasons. The results revealed that, in the Metro Vancouver area, the OFP hotspots have been significantly different from the VOC emission hotspots. In general, regional sources, especially those located in the northeastern direction of Metro Vancouver, have greater influence on the VOCs levels. However, OFP has been predominantly affected by transportation and industrial sources at the local scale. Therefore, to formulate effective strategies for reducing ground-level O3, the seasonal and spatial variations of major OFP sources should be assessed by the regulatory authorities. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Plastic waste is an environmental burden substance, which poses a high threat to the society during disposal. Rather than disposal, recycling of this waste to liquid fuel gains importance owing to its high utility. Among various techniques, thermo-chemical recycling techniques hold more benefits in generating high value added liquid fuels. In this review, the details of municipal plastic waste generation are provided with a brief description of the plastic waste management option and importance of recycling is explained. The overview of the thermo-chemical treatment focusing on the pyrolysis, gasification and hydrocracking process was elaborated. Catalysts mediated pyrolysis have wide-open their prospective for the generation of bio-oil, hydrocarbons, syngas and deterioration of undesired substances. Generally, advance development of enthusiastic catalysts for the synthesis of bio-oil would be vital for scaling up the pyrolysis process to succeed in commercial manufacture of biofuels from waste plastics. Overall rate treatment depends on operating parameter which determines the process efficiency and product yield. Hence, critical assessment of various parameter that has remarkable effect in the thermo-chemical treatment process was documented in detail. Moreover, endorsements of liquid fuel production, economic viability, and energy requirement of the treatment process, were delivered to attain effectual plastic wastes management. © 2020

AB  - Emission characteristics and performance of Neem seed and Camelina Sativa based biodiesel in diesel engine was studied. The engine test was carried out using diesel fuels (B0), 5% and 10% (volume) blends of Neem and Camelina Sativa oil methyl esters of NB5, NB10, CB5 and CB10. The Engine performance of these fuels was tested in a 1.9 Multijet diesel Engine. The blends met the EN 14214 and ASTM D6751 standards. Performance test of the Engine shows that CB10 biodiesel fuels produced better BP and averagely high BSFC compare to the diesel fuels all through the ranges of Engine speeds examined. The Emission test results also shows that NB5, CB5, NB10 and CB10 fuels reduced the average emissions of CO by 4.84%, 8.79%, 10.77% and 12.09%, for HC and CO2 their emission were 6.48%, 12.96%, 16.67%, 20.37%; and 2.64%, 4.55%, 5.72%, 6.74% compared to diesel fuels. NOx emission of the blends has higher emission values of 18.7%, 3.14%, 19.33%, and 19.78%, for NB5, CB5, NB10, and CB10 fuels compared to conventional fuels. CB10 produces lower emissions than other biodiesel fuels, thus reducing major pollution and ensuring environmental safety. CB10 can be used as a replacement for diesel fuels in unmodified engines. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - At present, the increasing consumption of fossil fuels as well as the expanding of more effective avenues to prepare carbon materials have inspired scholars' confidence to seek for alternative carbon sources. To address this issue, a N-doped graphene shell encapsulated metallic Co (Co@NGs) catalyst was fabricated using glucose and melamine as carbon source and nitrogen source via carbonization and employed for 5-hydroxylmethylfurfural (HMF) hydrogenation to produce 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) biofuel. Here, the prepared Co@NGs catalyst which possessed striking Mott-Schottky effect presented strong electronic interaction at the interface of surface metallic Co and doped N, leading to the electron transfer from metallic Co to doped N on carbon substrate. Experimental results indicated that the decreased electron density of metallic Co was more conductive to selective catalytic hydrogenation of HMF to form DMF. More importantly, the catalytic activity of the Mott-Schottky-type Co@NGs catalyst could be regulated by adjusting the nitrogen content. That is, the high nitrogen content increased the work function of Co@NGs and thus the enhanced rectifying response at the interface by which to enhance the catalytic performance. The best Co@NGs catalyst exhibited both high HMF conversion (close to 100 %) and DMF selectivity (94.7 %), much better than those of conventional N-doped carbon supported Co catalysts. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction is a promising process for conversion of algae to bio-oil that is especially suitable for the high moisture content of algal feedstock. A two-stage sequential hydrothermal liquefaction (SEQHTL) alternative was developed to facilitate production of co-products in addition to bio-oil at reduced temperatures and pressures compared with conventional one-stage direct hydrothermal liquefaction (DHTL). In this study, Aspen simulation and comprehensive techno-economic analysis were conducted for both SEQHTL and DHTL processes to assess their performance when used to convert the same algal strain (Chlorella sorokiniana) to bio-oil intermediates. The technical and economic evaluation also included the subsequent upgrading of the bio-crude to biofuels via hydrotreatment. The minimum fuel selling price for SEQHTL and DHTL was $1.61/L, and $2.10/L, respectively. The milder operating conditions of SEQHTL process resulted in both reduced capital and operating cost. The total installed cost of the facilities for hydrothermal processing 1215 metric tons/day of algae was $89 million for SEQHTL and $112 million for DHTL. A higher energy returned on energy invested was realized by SEQHTL (6.73) owing to its greater amount of fuel blendstock produced and less energy required for production in comparison with DHTL (5.31). The sensitivity analysis showed that improving the yield and quality of both the bio-oil and co-products, as well as increasing the feed concentration, may lead to a much lower production cost. This study provided new insights of hydrothermal liquefaction process design with highlighting the potential of recycling of nutrient streams and fractionation algal biomass at milder operating conditions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lignocelluloses’ pretreatment is targeted for the improvement of hydrolysis of their carbohydrates, i.e., cellulose and hemicelluloses. Modification of the hardheaded structure of lignocelluloses is a fundamental stair in biofuels and biochemicals production. The high crystalline configurations of cellulose embed with hemicelluloses and lignin, give rise to recalcitrance structure. Second-generation biofuel production processes, using lignocellulosic biomass as a feedstock, is based on a three-stage process, including pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, and fermentation. The pretreatment stage is the most critical, influencing, costly stage. The perfect pretreatment process is designated to provide minimum cellulosic crystallinity with remarkable low lignin content as well as inhibitory compounds through a sustainable economical process. In the present review, advances in lignocellulosic pretreatment technologies for biofuels production are reviewed and critically discussed. The article further discusses the pros and cons of the various pretreatment methodologies as well as addresses the role and impact of different process parameters associated with the pretreatment process. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: We hypothesize that the current heated scientific debate on bioenergy sustainability is fuelled by flaws in the interpretation phase of bioenergy LCA studies rather than by the lack of studies or shared methodologies. The interpretation phase is the key step in LCA studies, which guarantees their quality and consistency and gives meaning to the work carried out by delivering results that are consistent with the defined goal and scope, which reach conclusions, and explain limitations. Methods: To test our hypothesis, we selected the 100 most cited articles found in Scopus utilizing a query to include most of the relevant works on LCA of bioenergy. The rationale underpinning the choice of the most cited articles is that these are presumably the most influential. A further screening identified off-topic articles, reviews, and methodological papers, which were discarded. We have also checked whether the articles analysed referred to the ISO standards. The study is organized as a reasoned and parametrized review in which we assess the methodological approach of the studies, rather than the results obtained. Results and discussion: We find that overlooking some of the fundamental steps in the interpretation phase in bioenergy LCA is a rather common practice. Although most of the studies referred to the ISO standards, the identification of issues, their framing with sensitivity analyses, and the identification and reporting of limitations, which are all needed to comply with ISO14044 standards, are often neglected by practitioners. The most problematic part of the interpretation phase is the consistency check. In most cases, the assessment framework built is not apt at answering the question set in the goal. Limitations are properly identified and reported only in few studies. Conclusions: We conclude that in many studies either the conclusions and recommendations drawn are not robust because the inventory and the impact assessment phases are not consistent with the goal of the study, or the conclusions and recommendations go well beyond what the limitations of the study would allow. In our opinion, these flaws in the interpretation phase of influential LCA studies are among the responsible factors that continue to fuel the debate around the sustainability of bioenergy. We report a set of recommendations both for LCA practitioners and for users to guide the LCA practitioners in properly organizing and reporting their work, and to facilitate the readers in understanding and evaluating the significance and applicability of the results presented. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Today, the security of energy has become one of the primary concerns of all the countries around the world due to the limited energy sources, increasing population, energy prices fluctuations and limitations in energy supply. Japan is considered as one of the largest energy consumers and energy importers throughout the world which almost 96% of its primary energy supply in national level relies on the imports from other countries. After experiencing several harsh energy supply conditions over the last 40 years, Japan realized the sensitivity of its energy supply and decided to fundamentally restructure its energy supply and rely more on energy mix diversification, renewable energies, energy efficiency improvement, and carbon emissions reduction. In this article the energy security improvement and the government actions to boost diversification of energy by focusing more on renewable energies and reducing energy intensity, increasing energy efficiency and decreasing energy import dependency in Japan is studied. In addition, various renewable energy technologies as a substitute source of energy and promising ways of domestic energy supply as well as the factors to improve the security of energy supply are studied thoroughly. Moreover, it was realized that the most primary energy sources in Japan are biofuel and waste energy followed by hydropower and geothermal energy respectively. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - This article presents a microwave sensor for detecting the water volume fraction in the glycerol–water solutions. The sensor is designed using a planar transmission line terminated with a series RLC resonator. A very dense concentration of the electromagnetic field around the resonator at resonance provides a very high sensitivity to any dielectric loading. Two identical sensing elements are designed and fabricated for a differential measurement. The experimental results with glycerol–water solutions of various concentrations show a high sensitivity of the differential S-parameter level to the water volume fraction in the solutions. The proposed sensor offers a high sensitivity, compact, real-time, and robust measurement platform with potential application in bio-electronics, biofuel characterizations, and food industry. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Utilization of biodiesel which is of renewable in nature was enhanced in single cylinder, 4-S diesel engine based on combustion, performance and emission analysis. Esterified jatropha biodiesel (EJO) at 4%, 10% and 20% was added in normal diesel by v/v ratios to form B04, B10 and B20 blends. The crown surfaces of piston, cylinder head and valves were coated with 250 μm thick mullite material (Metco 6150) to form low heat rejection engine (LHRE). The optimum EJO blend for the conventional engine (CE) as well as LHRE was investigated by comparing their characteristics from all biodiesel blends with the normal diesel of CE operation. B10 was obtained as an optimum blend for both engines. For CE at B10 operation, the CO, HC emissions (except NOx) and brake thermal efficiency (BTE) were reduced as compared with CE at diesel fuel. For LHRE operation, the emissions were further reduced but BTE was slightly reduced. Finally to improve the usability of biodiesel, 5% anhydrous ethanol was added into optimum blend to form E05B10 mixture. Ethanol required higher latent heat for evaporation; this caused reduction of NOx and improved BTE. Emission load on environment (GWP, RIP and TAP) was reduced by optimum blend operation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study suggests the economic potential of biochar-based biodiesel production by conducting the techno-economic analysis. The itemized cost estimation was performed by categorizing biochar production facility and biodiesel conversion plants for 30,000 ton y−1 of biodiesel production capacity. The result of sensitivity analysis shows the methanol and waste cooking oil (WCO) costs are significantly sensitive to determine a unit biodiesel production cost. When the biodiesel selling price was 1.70 $ kg−1, the discounted payback period was varied from 1.91 (not discounted) to 2.06 years (10% discounted). In addition, the break-even price of biodiesel was calculated to 1.55 $ kg−1 when the discount rate was 10%. It means that this technology is to be feasible because of commercial diesel price (0.97 to 1.88 $ kg−1). The consideration of tax exemption and subsidy for biodiesel can be good option to supply WCO based energy production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study the use of Chlorella vulgaris biodiesel blends are tested in a naturally aspirated dual fuel diesel engine with various load conditions at a rated speed of 1500 rpm. In the engine, the test fuels such as B20 injection, B20 blending and diesel were prepared and tested. The combustion characteristic has provided a better understanding of the operation of the engine in dual-fuel mode. The combustion analysis was done at the injection timings of 23° angle before top dead centre with an injection pressure of 220 bars. The results show that 20% blend of Chlorella vulgaris microalgae biodiesel with 80% diesel produced higher cylinder pressures, heat release rate, lower combustion duration, and ignition delay as compared to diesel fuel. The experimental outcomes indicate that the usage of algae oil blend in diesel engine is a feasible option. © 2020 Scientific Publishers. All rights reserved.

AB  - Waste Sesamum indicum plant derived heterogeneous catalyst was utilized for the first time for biodiesel synthesis from sunflower oil. The derived catalyst was characterized by using Powder XRD, FT-IR, BET, TGA, XRF, AAS, XPS, SEM-EDX and TEM, and the characterization revealed the presence of Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, Si, Sr and Cl with high percentage of K (29.64 wt %) and Ca (33.80 wt %) as oxides and carbonates. The catalyst with a moderate surface area of 3.66 m2 g−1 exhibited excellent catalytic activity producing a yield of 98.9% biodiesel under the optimized conditions of 12:1 methanol to oil molar ratio and catalyst loading of 7 wt % at the reaction temperature of 65 °C in a short reaction time of only 40 min. The catalyst could be reused up to the 3rd cycle of reaction with the yield of 94.2% biodiesel. The characterization of biodiesel was done by using FT-IR, NMR, and GC-MS techniques. The fuel property of produced biodiesel meets the prescribed limits of international standard. The prepared catalyst is easy to handle, reusable, and found to be highly efficient green catalyst that could help in reduction of biodiesel cost. Thus, the catalyst can be recommended as a potential candidate for cost-effective biodiesel production at a large scale. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Following a rise in population, load demand is increasing even in the remote areas and islands of Bangladesh. Being an island that is also far from the mainland of Bangladesh, St. Martin's is in need of electricity. As it has ample renewable energy resources, a renewable energy-based microgrid system seems to be the ultimate solution, considering the ever-increasing price of diesel fuel. This study proposes a microgrid system and tests its technical and economic feasibility in that area. All possible configurations have been simulated to try and find the optimal system for the island, which would be eco-friendly and economical with and without considering renewable energy options. The existing power supply configuration has also been compared to the best system after analyzing and investigating all technical and economic feasibility. Sensitivity and risk analysis between different cases provide added value to this study. The results show that the current diesel-based system is not viable for the island's people, but rather a heavy burden to them due to the high cost of per unit electricity and the net present cost. In contrast, a PV /Wind/Diesel/Battery hybrid microgrid appeared to be the most feasible system. The proposed system is found to be around 1.5 times and 28% inexpensive considering the net present cost and cost of energy, respectively, with a high (56%) share of renewable energy which reduces 23% carbon dioxide. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - A combined cooling, heating, and power generation system is proposed for the recovery of exhaust waste heat of the diesel engine. The engine rejected heat recovery system consisted of a domestic water heater (DWH), an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) and an Ejector Refrigeration Cycle (ERC) for heating aims, power generation, and cooling aims, respectively. The Diesel engine is fed by different fuels and biofuels to drive the bottoming cycles. The Transesterification method has been used for biodiesel extraction from different oil-basis materials. The produced biodiesel supplied to the Diesel engine in different engine speeds and loads to evaluate the system performance from viewpoints of the energy and exergy. The highest generated power for the total system is obtained in the case of sunflower biodiesel blend and B10 sample as the fuel. The maximum overall system energy efficiency obtained when the canola B30 blend is applied in 100% load and 2400rpm. Based on the obtained results, the exergy efficiency considerably increases in the case of biodiesel, and diesel blends as the fuel compared to the pure diesel. Exergy efficiency was optimized for the proposed combined heating, cooling and power generation system at 100% load, 1700 rpm and B10 blend obtained from canola oil. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Among alternative fuels, biodiesel has been emphasized as a substantial candidate for diesel engines because of many advantages. However, the main shortcomings preventing more widespread use of biodiesel are high production cost and viscosity. In order to simultaneously overcome both of these shortcomings, the reaction conditions for the transesterification of waste cooking oil (WCO) were optimized using Taguchi and the full factorial design approaches. The analyses of signal to noise ratio and variance were also performed to identify the dominance of reaction conditions on viscosity and biodiesel yield. As a result, the optimal reaction conditions giving the lowest kinematic viscosity (3.991 cSt) and the highest biodiesel yield (98.19%) were determined to be as follows: sodium methoxide amount of 1.00 wt%, reaction time of 60 min, reaction temperature of 55 °C, and methanol to oil molar ratio of 6:1. The catalyst amount and methanol to oil molar ratio were found to be the most significant conditions influencing on the viscosity (10.36% and 78.87% contributions) and the yield (58.48% and 20.17% contributions), respectively. Finally, all physicochemical properties of final waste cooking oil biodiesel (WCOB) produced under optimal reaction conditions were found to meet the EN 14214. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Presently biodiesel is widely used globally due to high scarcity of petroleum products and being a renewable fuel which can be used with the current fuelling infrastructure in an unmodified diesel engine. It is a harmless, recyclable, and ecofriendly fuel (reduces air pollutions such as dust, particulates, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and oxides of sulphur and air toxics). In India, the favourable conditions for the growth of Jatropha exist. Its use a biofuel is going to prove very beneficial for the Indian as well as the world market with the increase in fossil fuel’s demand and its reducing availability. The only drawback in using jatropha oil as a fuel is that the NOx emission is more than that of petroleum diesel. This paper deals with the implementation of exhaust gas recirculation to reduce the emission of NOx and to study its characteristics with respect to the performance of the engine.

AB  - This contribution reports an unprecedentedly efficient dimerization and the first successful polymerization of lignocellulose-based β-angelica lactone (β-AL) by utilizing a selective Lewis pair (LP) catalytic system, thereby establishing a versatile bio-refinery platform wherein two products, including a dimer for high-quality gasoline-like biofuel (C8–C9 branched alkanes, yield=87 %) and a heat- and solvent-resistant acrylic bioplastic (Mn up to 26.0 kg mol−1), can be synthesized from one feedstock by one catalytic system. The underlying reason for exquisite selectivity of the LP catalytic system toward dimerization and polymerization was explored mechanistically. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Waste biomass derived heterogeneous catalyst is an excellent alternative to chemically synthesized catalysts. In this work, calcined Tectona grandis leaves were proposed as an eco-friendly, renewable and low cost heterogeneous base catalyst. The prepared catalyst was examined by FTIR, XRD, XPS, SEM, EDX, TEM, TGA, BET and Hammett indicator test. The catalyst has an appealing nature towards various chemical transformations due to its basic surface sites provided by alkali and alkaline earth metals. The efficiency of the catalyst was successfully investigated by its application in biodiesel production. The products were confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR. 100% FAME conversion was attained using a catalyst loading of 2.5 wt% under optimized reaction parameters. The catalyst was further explored for Knoevenagel condensation reaction, in which it showed its effectiveness and recyclability towards the formation of benzylidenemalononitrile derivatives of aryl aldehydes. Thus, it is a potential ‘green catalyst’ derived from waste biomass without any addition of chemicals that can replace the industrial base catalysts used for biodiesel production and Knoevenagel reaction and makes the protocol environmentally benign. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Palm oil is largely produced in Thailand and sufficient to utilize as a biofuel feedstock through hydrodeoxygenation (HDO). In this work a new bifunctional catalyst consisting of nickel phosphide supported on zeolite mordenite in sodium form (Ni-P/NaMOR) was prepared by sequential impregnation and characterized extensively by several techniques to understand the reduction behavior, phases and distribution of nickel phosphides on the support. Nickel and phosphate precursors were transformed to Ni2P2O7 species by calcination and to a mixed phase between Ni12P5 and Ni2P by reduction. The phosphide species distributed in the zeolite cavities and external surface. The HDO of palm oil was tested in a down-flow stainless steel trickle bed reactor and the atmosphere was hydrogen. The mixed phase of nickel phosphides enhanced the HDO reaction. When tested by various temperatures and pressures, the optimum condition in this work was at 425 °C and 50 bar in which a complete of palm oil conversion, the largest HDO yield and selectivity toward C15-C18 alkanes were obtained. The green diesel and HDO yields from reduced Ni-P/NaMOR were larger than those from pure Ni2P and mixed Ni2P-Ni12P5. Interestingly, a small amount of isoparaffins was also observed likely due to the contribution of NaMOR support. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this work, the cerium oxide (CeO2) nanocatalyst was employed as a catalyst to enhance the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of microalgae to bio-oil conversion. The HTL optimized parameters were obtained from response surface methodology (RSM). The Spirulina Platensis is blue-green algae were used to convert into bio-oil. The major processing method for bio-oil conversion was designed based on three key parameters, such as temperature, residence time and catalyst concentration. A remarkable enhancement of bio-oil production was observed for 0.20 g of CeO2 catalyzed HTL at 250 °C for 30 min, and around 26% of conversion was achieved which is higher than catalyst-free HTL reaction (16%). The synthetic CeO2 nanostructure was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), brunauer-emmett-teller surface area (BET), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The chemical composition of bio-oil was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and the functional group analysis was done using fourier transform-infra red spectroscopy (FT-IR). The obtained results clearly reveal that the major chemical constituents such as hydrocarbons (7.55%), amino acids (36.69%) and nitrogen compounds (21.58%) for the bio-oil increased during CeO2 catalyzed HTL reaction. This investigation depicts that, the CeO2 nanoparticle could be employed as a potential candidate to accelerate the bio-oil conversion through HTL at low temperature from Spirulina platensis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An increase in population, rapid urbanization and industrialization has accelerated the rate of municipal solid waste generation. The current disposal of solid waste is a burgeoning issue and it's in immediate need to shift the existing disposal processes to a sustainable manner. Circular economy (CE) is a conceptual model which is been used for better use of resources and minimization of waste in a closed loop approach which could be appropriate for waste management. In this context, the present review illustrates the effective use of biodegradable and non-biodegradable fraction of solid waste in a closed loop integrated refinery platforms for the recovery of bioenergy resources and for the production of value added products. The biodegradable fraction of solid waste could be treated by advanced biological processes with the simultaneous production of bioenergy such as biohydrogen, biomethane, bioelectricity, etc., and other value added products like butanol, ethanol, methanol etc. The scheme illustrates the closed loop approach, the bioenergy generated from the biodegradable fraction of solid waste could be used for the operation of internal combustion engines and the energy could be further used for processing the waste. The non-biodegradable fraction of solid waste could be used for construction and pavement processes. Overall the study emphasizes the paradigm shift of solid waste management concepts from linear economy to a circular economy following the “Zero Waste” concept. The study also explains the circular economy policies practiced for solid waste management that stimulates the economy of the country and identify the pathways to maximize the local resources. In addition the review addresses the advanced information and communication technologies to unfold the issues and challenges faced in the solid waste management. The smart governance of managing waste using the “Internet of Things” (IoT) is one of the great precursors of technological development that could lead innovations in waste management. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study tested the suitability of solid residue (CaO) derived from the mixture of wastes biomass as based catalyst transesterification conversion of the blend of neem oilseed (Azadirachta indica A.Juss) with rendered pig fat. Blending was done in the ratio of Neem oil: Pig fat oil (v/v) as 10:90 (NO10),20:80 (NO20),30:70 (NO30), 40:60 (NO40), 50:50 (NO50), 60:40 (NO60), 70:30 (NO70), 80:20 (NO80), and 90:10 (NO90), respectively. Process parameter transesterification optimization of methanolysis CaO catalyst for synthesis of 60:40 to mixed oil biodiesel (MOB) was investigated using central composite design that generates thirty experimental runs and were carried out. Results showed low viscous oil at blend of 60:40. The predicted MOB yield of 98.05 (wt. %) at catalyst amount of 2.179 (g), reaction time of 57.45 min, reaction temperature of 59.91 °C, and MeOH/OMR of 5.9:1 (ml/ml), was validated in triplicate, and an average MOB yield of 98.03 (wt. %) was obtained. Results of XRD analysis indicated CaO as the predominant constituent element obtained from the mixture of calcined palm kernel shell husk (CPKSH) and calcined fermented kola nut husk (CFKNH). The qualities of MOB produced were within the biodiesel standard. © 2020

AB  - Spent coffee grounds (SCGs) have a potential to be used as a feedstock for higher value-added products, such as biodiesel. However, the environmental implications of the valorisation of SCGs are largely unknown. This study evaluates the life cycle environmental impacts of utilising SCGs for biodiesel production in comparison with the widely used disposal of SCGs as a waste stream: incineration, landfilling, anaerobic digestion, composting and direct application to land. The scope is from cradle to grave and the functional unit is defined as ‘treatment of 1 tonne of SCGs’. The results show that the most environmentally sustainable option is incineration of SCGs, with net-negative impacts (savings) in 14 out of 16 categories, followed by direct application of SCGs to land with 11 net-negative impacts. Biodiesel production is the least sustainable option with the highest impacts in 11 categories, followed by composting. The paper also demonstrates that following various waste hierarchy and resource valorisation guidelines instead of a life cycle approach could lead to a choice of environmentally inferior SCG utilisation options. Therefore, these guidelines should be revised to ensure that they are consistent and underpinned by life cycle thinking, thus aiding sustainable resource management in a circular economy context. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - The present work offered a comprehensive investigation of engine characteristics of diesel engine driven with diesel and papaya seed oil methyl ester (POME). The chemical compositions of POME were explored using FTIR and GC-MS analysis. 1% of Di-Tertiary Butyl Peroxide (DTBP) and Pyrogallol (PY) were used as ignition promoters with POME for achieving improved cetane number and enhanced ignition. In order to utilize the maximum available energy in the fuel thermal barrier coating was attempted. Partially Stabilized Zirconia coating on combustion chamber components leads to diminished heat loss from engine. The aim of the present experimentation was to analyse the consequence of papaya seed oil biodiesel with presence of ignition promoter in coated and uncoated engine characteristics. In PSZ coated engine, POME and PY blend showed 3.15% of increased thermal efficiency with 2.17% of declined fuel consumption. Reduced emissions were noticed with POME and PY blend in PSZ coated engine. Superior combustion efficiency, in-cylinder pressure, heat release rate and combustion duration were witnessed with POME and PY blend in coated engine due to short ignition delay. The practice of using ignition promoter-treated biodiesel in thermally coated engine was said to be the prominent method for achieving enhanced engine characteristics. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To meet the worldwide rapid growth of industrialization and population, the demand for the production of bioethanol as an alternative green biofuel is gaining significant prominence. The bioethanol production process is still considered one of the largest energy-consuming processes and is challenging due to the limited effectiveness of conventional pretreatment processes, saccharification processes, and extreme use of electricity in common fermentation and purification processes. Thus, it became necessary to improve the bioethanol production process through reduced energy requirements. Membrane-based separation technologies have already gained attention due to their reduced energy requirements, investment in lower labor costs, lower space requirements, and wide flexibility in operations. For the selective conversion of biomasses to bioethanol, membrane bioreactors are specifically well suited. Advanced membrane-integrated processes can effectively contribute to different stages of bioethanol production processes, including enzymatic saccharification, concentrating feed solutions for fermentation, improving pretreatment processes, and finally purification processes. Advanced membrane-integrated simultaneous saccharification, filtration, and fermentation strategies consisting of ultrafiltration-based enzyme recycle system with nanofiltration-based high-density cell recycle fermentation system or the combination of high-density cell recycle fermentation system with membrane pervaporation or distillation can definitely contribute to the development of the most efficient and economically sustainable second-generation bioethanol production process. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020.

AB  - Emissions from biodiesel combustion depend on types of feedstocks. This study investigated physicochemical properties of biodiesels in three various feedstocks generations and the effect of them on emissions and performance of the unmodified engine. Methyl esters from Eruca sativa (ES) which has crops with short production cycle and drought-tolerant capacity, waste cooking oil (WCO) as an economic feedstock, and microalgae Chlorella vulgaris (MCV) which have high growth rate and productivity without farmland requirement, were produced by transesterification process with methanol and KOH catalyst. Physicochemical properties of these biodiesels were determined by GC-MS and FTIR analysis and evaluated with ASTM D6751 standard. FAME components profile illustrated the high value of oleic acid (C18:1) in ES and WCO and long-chain fatty acids (C18:2 and higher) in MCV. The engine tests results indicated that MCV biodiesel produced slightly lower power and higher BSFC compared with others. There was a slight increase in NOx for MCV biodiesel compared with pure diesel. Conversely, ES and WCO biodiesels had a reduction in NOx. On the other hand, MCV biodiesel resulted in the greatest reduction in CO and HC emissions. Based on the results, MCV blends had the lowest emissions and the best function among all feedstocks. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, refined bleached deodorised palm oil (RPO) and palm kernel oil (PKO) obtained from palm oil refinery, were used as feedstocks to investigate the production of bio-hydrogenated kerosene (BHK) via hydrocracking reaction. A statistical tool of box-behnken design (BBD) was applied to consider the effects of reaction temperature, pressure and liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) on biofuel production from RPO. The results revealed that the temperature was strongly significant effect on the yield and the optimal condition was found at 477 °C, 5.6 MPa and 1.5 h−1 of LHSV. Subsequently, crude biofuel was separated by fractional distillation, the biofuel yield was obtained at approximately 90% and providing 49.59% kerosene selectivity. Curiously, another feedstock of PKO which has lauric acid as the main composition whereas RPO contained palmitic and oleic acids, was used to produce BHK by using operating condition based-on RPO optimal condition. The biofuel yield derived from PKO reached at the same quantity. On the other hand, kerosene selectivity obtained was higher than in case of RPO (55.35%). However, high oxygen content was found in PKO-derived BHK, and this affected to freezing point and total acid number. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Flocculants are foreign particles that aggregate suspended microalgae cells and due to cost factor and toxicity, harvesting of microalgae biomass has shifted towards the use of bioflocculants. In this study, mild acid-extracted bioflocculants from waste chicken's eggshell and clam shell were used to harvest Chlorella vulgaris that was cultivated using chicken compost as nutrient source. It was found that a maximum of 99% flocculation efficiency can be attained at pH medium of 9.8 using 60 mg/L of hydrochloric acid-extracted chicken's eggshell bioflocculant at 50 °C of reaction temperature. On the other hand, 80 mg/L of hydrochloric acid-extracted clam shell bioflocculant was sufficient to recover C. vulgaris biomass at pH 9.8 and optimum temperature of 40 °C. The bioflocculants and bioflocs were characterized using microscopic, zeta potential, XRD, AAS and FT-IR analysis. The result revealed that calcium ions in the bioflocculants are the main contributor towards the flocculation of C. vulgaris, employing charge neutralization and sweeping as possible flocculation mechanisms. The kinetic parameters were best fitted pseudo-second order which resulted in R2 of 0.99 under optimal flocculation temperature. The results herein, disclosed the applicability of shell waste-derived bioflocculants for up-scaled microalgae harvesting for biodiesel production. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Fossil fuel consumption provides a negative impact on the human health and environment in parallel with the decreased availability of this valuable natural resource for the future generations to use as a source of chemical energy for all applications in energy, power, and propulsion. The diesel fuel consumption in the transport sector is higher than the gasoline in most developing countries for reasons of cost and economy. Biodiesel fuel offers a good replacement for diesel fuel in compression ignition (CI) diesel engines. Earlier investigations by the authors revealed that a blend of 70% amla seed oil biodiesel and 30% eucalyptus oil (AB70EU30) is the favorable alternative renewable fuel blend that can be used as a fuel in diesel engines. With any fuel, air/fuel mixing and mixture preparation impact efficiency, emissions, and performance in CI engines. Minor adjustments in engine parameters to improve air/fuel mixing and combustion are deployable approaches to achieve good performance with alternative fuel blends in CI engines. This paper provides the role of a minor modification to engine parameters (compression ratio, injection timing, and injection pressure) on improved performance using the above mixture of binary fuel blends (AB70EU30). The results showed that the use of AB70EU30 in modified engine resulted in higher brake thermal efficiency and lower brake specific fuel consumption compared to normal diesel for improved combustion that also resulted in very low tailpipe emissions.

AB  - The present study aims to evaluate the combustion, performance and emission characteristics of a diesel engine fueled with SB and its water blends (10% and 20%), and the results compared with BD. Emulsion fuels were prepared using Sorbitan monolaurate surfactant and high-speed of mechanical agitation, and the properties were measured. Experiments were conducted in a single-cylinder, 4-stroke and naturally aspirated diesel engine with an eddy current dynamometer under different BMEP conditions. The measured physicochemical properties of test fuels are at par with standard limits except for SB20W emulsion fuel's viscosity. The peak ICP, NHR, RPR and IDP are reduced for SB compared to BD, whereas significant increases are recorded with water emulsified SBs. The BSFC of SB is higher than BD due to its lower calorific value. However, the BSEC of SB and SB10W emulsion fuel is lower than BD due to an enhanced combustion reaction. The pure SB exhibits a higher magnitude of NOx emission and lower magnitude of smoke, CO and HC emissions compared to BD. An increase in water concentration reduces the NOx emission, and SB10W emulsion fuel exhibits better smoke, HC and CO emissions under partial and peak BMEP conditions compared to other test fuels. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, an attempt has been made to investigate the use of higher blend percentage of biodiesel in diesel engines without affecting much on the performance of engines using fuel additives. Waste cooking oil (WCO) biodiesel B30 blend (WCO 30% + neat diesel 70%) and B40 (WCO 40% + neat diesel 70%) are used as the fuel together with diethyl ether and Cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticles as additives. Biodiesel is mixed with 2% by volume of diethyl ether (DEE) and 80 ppm concentration of CeO2 nanoparticles which are maintained constant throughout the study. Performance, combustion characteristics and emission parameters have been studied and compared with the values for neat B30 and B40 biodiesel. Results showed that brake thermal efficiency of B30 with additives is 29.57% and is at par with neat B20 operation (29.72%). Maximum reduction of HC and smoke emissions are observed for B40 with additives, which are 16% and 11.7% less than neat B20 fuel operation. B30 with diethyl ether and CeO2 nanoparticles showed minimum NOx emission which is 6% less than neat B20. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Diesel-like hydrocarbons were produced by the catalytic deoxygenation (DO) of Jatropha curcas oil (JCO) over novel Agx/AC and Niy-Agx/AC catalysts under an H2-free atmosphere. The AC was synthesized from coconut fibre residues (CFR), where CFR is the by-product from coconut milk extraction and is particularly rich in soft fibres with high mineral content. The Niy-Agx/AC catalyst afforded higher DO activity via the decarboxylation/decarbonylation (deCOx) route than Agx/AC due to the properties of Ni, synergistic interaction of Ni and Ag species, adequate amount of strong acid sites and large number of weak acid sites, which cause extensive C-O cleavage and lead to rich formation of n-(C15+C17) hydrocarbons. The effect of Ag and Ni content were studied within the 5 to 15 wt% range. An optimum Ni and Ag metal content (5 wt%) for deCOx reaction was observed. Excess Ni is not preferable due to a tendency for cracking and Ag-rich containing catalyst weakly enforced triglycerides breaking. The Ni5-Ag5/AC govern exclusively decarbonylation reaction, which corroborates the presence of Ni2+ species and a high amount of strong acid sites. Ultimately, Ni5-Ag5/AC in the present study shows excellent chemical stability with consistent five reusability without drastic reduction of hydrocarbon yield (78–95%) and n-(C15+C17) selectivity (82–83%), which indicate favourable application in JCO DO. © 2019

AB  - This paper aims in assessing the effect of biofuel blend such as butanol, jatropha methyl ester, soya methyl ester and rapeseed methyl ester as an additive for the aviation fuel. In addition to the blends, the nanoparticle TiO2 of 3% is added to the biofuel. The nanoparticle mixed at the concentration of 300ppm by ultrasonication process. The fuel Jet A, B27T, J27T, S27T and R27T are investigated for combustion and emission characteristics for various throttle settings in micro gas turbine engine. Addition of additives improves the ultimate property of the fuel by reducing the kinematic viscosity. The fuel blend B27T reports 25% increase in total static thrust and 22% reduction in thrust specific fuel consumption. From the results it is evident that, all fuel blends showed a significant reduction in emission values owing to high oxygen content. In addition, the thermal efficiency of the B27T and J27T is improved appreciably to 30% and 10% higher than Jet A fuel owing to the influence of the nanoparticle TiO2. On the other hand, the emissions like CO and NOx reduced drastically up to 70% and 45% respectively. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020.

AB  - The large-scale application of bio-oil has been restricted due to its high O content, strong acidity and low heat value. Therefore, the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of phenols, acids, and ketones as bio-oil model compounds for hydrocarbon fuel via Ni-based catalysts modified by metal oxides (Al, La and Ga) was investigated. The results showed that the hydrocarbon content was over 70.65% when the mixed supported catalysts Ni/HZSM-5-γ-Al2O3, Ni/HBeta-La2O3 and Ni/HBeta-Ga2O3 were used for the HDO of guaiacol (GUA). Cyclic hydrocarbons and aromatic hydrocarbons were the main products. Among these catalysts, Ni/HZSM-5-γ-Al2O3 was the most effective in the HDO of acetic acid. The conversion and hydrocarbon content were 100.00% and 88.62%, respectively. Long-chain alkanes were the main components of the upgraded liquid. Ni/HZSM-5-γ-Al2O3 was beneficial for the HDO of hydroxyacetone with 100.00% conversion, 80.30% hydrocarbon content and 48.67% yield. The HDO pathways of GUA, acetic acid and hydroxyacetone were as follows: 1) GUA was mainly converted into benzene and its derivatives by transmethylation, isomerization and hydrogenation (HYD). 2) Acetic acid was converted to long-chain alkanes by HYD, self-condensation, saturated HYD and isomerization. 3) Hydroxyacetone was converted into long-chain alkanes by HYD, self-condensation, demethylation, aldol condensation and saturated HYD. This work provides basic data for obtaining renewable hydrocarbon fuel from biomass via HDO with a low-cost catalyst. © 2019

AB  - The potential of palm-oil biofuels to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared with fossil fuels is increasingly questioned. So far, no measurement-based GHG budgets were available, and plantation age was ignored in Life Cycle Analyses (LCA). Here, we conduct LCA based on measured CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes in young and mature Indonesian oil palm plantations. CO2 dominates the on-site GHG budgets. The young plantation is a carbon source (1012 ± 51 gC m−2 yr−1), the mature plantation a sink (−754 ± 38 gC m−2 yr−1). LCA considering the measured fluxes shows higher GHG emissions for palm-oil biodiesel than traditional LCA assuming carbon neutrality. Plantation rotation-cycle extension and earlier-yielding varieties potentially decrease GHG emissions. Due to the high emissions associated with forest conversion to oil palm, our results indicate that only biodiesel from second rotation-cycle plantations or plantations established on degraded land has the potential for pronounced GHG emission savings. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Wet torrefaction is a promising method to converts the high moisture microalgae to biofuel. In this study, the microalgae were torrefied in water or dilute acid solutions with the aid of microwaves irradiation. The reaction temperature and heating time were fixed at 160 °C and 10 min. The effects of sulfuric, phosphorus, and succinic acids on two different microalgae species (Chlorella vulgaris ESP-31 and FSP-E) were investigated. As a result, the disruption of the microalga FSP-E (high protein) was not notable in the acidic solution. The higher heating value of wet torrefied microalga ESP-31 (high carbohydrate) in succinic acid was enhanced up to 40% with at least 45% of energy yield. The use of 0.1 M of phosphorus acid in wet torrefaction produced the highest ash content of 1.61 and 11.60 wt% for microalgae ESP-31 and FSP-E, respectively. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed that the carbohydrate content of microalga ESP-31 has the highest degradation in sulfuric acid solution. In contrast, crystalline cellulose in the microalgae is hardly affected by the wet torrefaction process in low-temperature acidic solution. In terms of liquid product, a maximum glucose extraction of 35.39 g/L occurred with the use of 0.1 M of sulfuric acid. In conclusion, biochar produced using organic acid is desirable as solid fuel, whereas the use of sulfuric acid is more suitable to produce sugar for bioethanol production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae bio-oil production is related to the sustainable use of world energy in the future. In the present work, catalytic pyrolysis and liquefaction behavior of microalgae for bio-oil production were investigated. The results show that the rare earth compounds as catalysts contributed to significantly accelerating the pyrolysis of microalgae via reducing the activation energy of pyrolysis process. Ce(II)/HZSM-5 presented the optimal catalytic pyrolysis and liquefaction effects by helping cut the microalgae molecule chains. The maximum bio-oil yield amounted to 49.71 wt% at the catalyst concentration of 5 wt%. The chemical components of the Spirulina bio-oil were composed of carboxylic acids, ketones, olefins, amides, ethers, esters, and partially cyclic N-containing compounds. Although the combustion performances of the Spirulina bio-oil are worse than those of the diesel fuel, it is superior to the reported rice husk bio-oil, suggesting a promising potential application prospect. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The current experimental study presents solid (non-volatile) particle number emissions with a size cut-off at 23 nm (SPN23, referred to as PN hereinafter) under real-world driving conditions for 8 passenger cars powered by diesel, gasoline, Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and hybrid-electric powertrains. The objective was to identify the highest emitters and assess whether PN focus should be extended to engine and fuel types other than diesel and gasoline direct injection (GDI). Results (under the cold-start RDE-compliant route) show that a Euro 6b gasoline vehicle equipped with port fuel injection (PFI) engine, comprised the highest PN emitter (4.5 times higher than the Euro 6 limit of 6 × 1011 p/km), while similar emission levels (up to 3.7 times higher than this limit) were detected in the older-technology (Euro 3 and 4) gasoline and (retrofitted) LPG PFI vehicles. This limit was also exceeded (by 1.7 times) by one gasoline direct injection (GDI) Euro 6b non-GPF vehicle. PN emissions from the hybrid-electric vehicle (equipped with gasoline PFI engine) were lower than the other Euro 6b PFI vehicle, but still high compared to typical PFI engines found in literature. The lowest emissions were detected in diesel and CNG engines (as low as 7.8 × 109 and 2.4 × 1010 p/km respectively). Euro 6b LPG vehicle was found to be a low emitter (3.3 times lower than the 6 × 1011 p/km limit), while similar emission levels were detected in the other Euro 6b non-GPF GDI vehicle. Among the different driving sections (urban, rural, motorway), urban and especially the cold phase had the highest contribution in most cases. Finally, a significant PN reduction potential was observed with LPG and CNG over gasoline (up to 93% and 90% respectively), although the opposite trend was detected in an old-technology retrofitted LPG vehicle. These results indicate that close attention should be focused on other engine and fuel types, apart from diesel and GDI. Regulatory initiatives towards air pollution reduction should include measures for the reduction of high-emission old-technology gasoline and LPG vehicles, while modern gasoline PFI engines should also be further scrutinized. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Although production of biodiesels from microalgae is proved to be technically feasible, a commercially viable system has yet to emerge. High-cell-density fermentation of microalgae can be coupled with photoautotrophic cultivation to produce oils. In this study, by optimizing culturing conditions and employing a sophisticated substrate feed control strategy, ultrahigh-cell-density of 286 and 283.5 g/L was achieved for the unicellular alga Scenedesmus acuminatus grown in 7.5-L bench-scale and 1,000-L pilot-scale fermenters, respectively. The outdoor scale-up experiments indicated that heterotrophically grown S. acuminatus cells are more productive in terms of both biomass and lipid accumulation when they are inoculated in photobioreactors for lipid production as compared to the cells originally grown under photoautotrophic conditions. Technoeconomic analysis based on the pilot-scale data indicated that the cost of heterotrophic cultivation of microalgae for biomass production is comparable with that of the open-pond system and much lower than that of tubular PBR, if the biomass yield was higher than 200 g/L. This study demonstrated the economic viability of heterotrophic cultivation on large-scale microalgal inocula production, but ultrahigh-productivity fermentation is a prerequisite. Moreover, the advantages of the combined heterotrophic and photoautotrophic cultivation of microalgae for biofuels production were also verified in the pilot-scale. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - The application of ethanol in diesel engines is limited for the poor solubility. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) as a promising biofuel can improve the solubility. In this study, the effects of THF and ethanol on combustion and emissions were investigated on a six-cylinder heavy-duty diesel engine. In terms of test fuels, the volume ratio of THF was 5%, and ethanol ratio was 0%, 10%, and 30%, respectively. Results show that the combustion characteristics are nearly the same in both fuels with and without THF addition in diesel. With the increase of ethanol, the ignition delay prolongs, the peak heat release rate raises and brake thermal efficiency increases. The delay of the combustion phase at a low load is more obvious than a high load. The addition of THF or 30% ethanol increases NOx emissions, while the addition of 10% ethanol reduces NOx emissions at low load. Also, the addition of THF or ethanol decreases soot emissions significantly, but HC and CO emissions increase significantly at low loads. In the World Harmonized Stationary Cycle test cycle of Euro VI regulation (the speeds contain 998, 1137, 1276, 1415, and 1694 rpm and the loads cover the idle to full load), compared with diesel fuel, the addition of 10% and 30% ethanol makes BTE decrease by 1.7% and 0.8%, NOx emissions increase by 16.2% and 22.6%, soot emissions decrease by 39.2% and 77.3%, HC emissions increase by 6.9% and 39.3%, and CO emissions decrease by 13% and increase by 43.5%, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To reduce the climate impact of shipping, the introduction of alternative fuels is required. There is a range of different marine fuel options but ammonia, a potential zero carbon fuel, has recently received a lot of attention. The purpose of this paper is to assess the prospects for ammonia as a future fuel for the shipping sector in relation to other marine fuels. The assessment is based on a synthesis of knowledge in combination with: (i) energy systems modeling including the cost-effectiveness of ammonia as marine fuel in relation to other fuels for reaching global climate targets; and (ii) a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach ranking marine fuel options while considering estimated fuel performance and the importance of criteria based on maritime stakeholder preferences. In the long-term and to reach global GHG reduction, the energy systems modeled indicate that the use of hydrogen represents a more cost-effective marine fuel option than ammonia. However, in the MCDA covering more aspects, we find that ammonia may be almost as interesting for shipping related stakeholders as hydrogen and various biomass-based fuels. Ammonia may to some extent be an interesting future marine fuel option, but many issues remain to be solved before large-scale introduction. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is considered abundant renewable feedstock to constitute a green and environmentally friendly approach for biofuels (bio-butanol) production as an effective substitute for fossil resources. However, a variety of fermentable inhibitors can be generated in hydrolysates during the biomass pretreatment process. Among them, phenolics including phenolic acids and phenolic aldehydes are the most toxic inhibitors to solventogenic clostridia for bio-butanol production. This study elucidates the physiological mechanism of Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 response to phenolic inhibitors by the integration of kinetics and transcriptional analysis. Butanol fermentations were stressed by 0.4 g/L phenolic acids or 0.4 g/L phenolic aldehydes at 12 h at the beginning of solventogenesis. With post-stress for 12 h, butanol titer was 7.01 g/L in fermentation with phenolic acid stress, while only 5.82 g/L butanol was produced in the case of phenolic aldehydes stress. Reductions in the two fermentations were 27.6% and 40.0% in comparison with the control (without stress), indicated that phenolic aldehydes had a stronger inhibitory effect on solvents synthesis in C. acetobutylicum than phenolic acids. Additionally, the transcriptional analysis revealed that phenolics altered the gene expression profiles related to membrane transporters such as ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-transporter and phosphotransferase system (PTS), glycolysis, and heat shock proteins. The lower expression levels of PTS-related genes might result in reduced glucose consumption and finally inhibited solvents synthesis under phenolic aldehydes stress. Some genes encoding histidine kinase (CA_C0323, CA_C0903, and CA_C3319) were also affected by phenolics, which might inhibit sporulation. In conclusion, our results provide valuable guidance for the construction of robust strain to efficiently produce bio-butanol from lignocellulosic biomass. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Microalgae, due to its well-recognized advantages have gained renewed interest as potentially good feedstock for biodiesel. Production of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) as a type of biodiesel was carried out from Chlorella vulgaris bio-oil. Biodiesel was produced in the presence of nano-biocatalysts composed of immobilized lipase on functionalized superparamagnetic few-layer graphene oxide via a transesterification reaction. A hybrid of few-layer graphene oxide and Fe3O4 (MGO) was prepared and characterized. The MGO was functionalized with 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (MGO-AP) as well as with a couple of AP and glutaraldehyde (MGO-AP-GA). The Rhizopus oryzae lipase (ROL) was immobilized on MGO and MGO-AP using electrostatic interactions as well as on MGO-AP-GA using covalent bonding. The supports, MGO, MGO-AP, and MGO-AP-GA, as well as nano-biocatalyst, ROL/MGO, ROL/MGO-AP, and ROL/MGO-AP-GA, were characterized using FESEM, VSM, FTIR, and XRD. The few-layer graphene oxide was characterized using AFM and the surface charge of supports was evaluated with the zeta potential technique. The nano-biocatalysts assay was performed with an evaluation of kinetic parameters, loading capacity, relative activity, time-course thermal stability, and storage stability. Biodiesel production was carried out in the presence of nano-biocatalysts and their reusability was evaluated in 5 cycles of transesterification reaction. Results: The AFM analysis confirmed the few-layer structure of graphene oxide and VSM also confirmed that all supports were superparamagnetic. The maximum loading of ROL (70.2%) was related to MGO-AP-GA. The highest biodiesel conversion of 71.19% achieved in the presence of ROL/MGO-AP-GA. Furthermore, this nano-biocatalyst could maintain 58.77% of its catalytic performance after 5 cycles of the transesterification reaction and was the best catalyst in the case of reusability. Conclusions: In this study, the synthesized nano-biocatalyst based on bare and functionalized magnetic graphene oxide was applied and optimized in the process of converting microalgae bio-oil to biodiesel for the first time and compared with bare lipase immobilized on magnetic nanoparticles. Results showed that the loading capacity, kinetic parameters, thermal stability, and storage stability improved by the functionalization of MGO. The biocatalysts, which were prepared via covalent bonding immobilization of enzyme generally, showed better characteristics. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - The increasing transportation needs, demand for petroleum-based diesel and harmful vehicular emissions take us to look for safer and economically feasible alternative fuels. Biodiesel produced from Chlorella variabilis MK039712.1 and waste cooking oil was tested and compared with petroleum-based diesel for their performance and emission characteristics using IC Engine set up, tested under Kirloskar TV1 having power 5.20 kW @ 1500 rpm. The effect of algal oil biodiesel (AOBD) on Waste cooking oil biodiesel (WCOBD) as blends (0–100%) on Brake thermal efficiency (%) (BTE), Brake power (KW) (BP), Brake specific fuel consumption (kg/kWh) (BSFC), Smoke opacity (%) (SO), CO, CO2, NOx and HC emissions have been investigated. WCOBD has better engine performance than AOBD which is evident from its lower BSFC, higher BTE and BP than AOBD. However, AOBD proves better from an emissions point of view as emission reports show lesser CO% and higher CO2% than WCOBD and CD. NOx emissions for both the fuels were higher compared to Conventional diesel (CD). The properties and performance characteristics of the test blends are found to be comparable with ASTM Standards which is a favourable fuel requirement. Reduction in Smoke opacity (SO) of WCOBD in comparison with CD shows the clean-burning tendency. Overall, the pure and blend of AOBD with WCOBD has improved engine performance and emission characteristics, which is substantiated by the analysis of properties, performance and emission data by absolute percentage deviation (APD) a statistical method of analysis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The investigation was conducted with an aim to explore the potential of novel, less explored biodiesel from Spirulina platensis algae, which can be used as an alternate fuel for conventional diesel. The effect of biodiesel on performance, combustion and emission characteristics of diesel engine was experimentally investigated. The ignition delay period declined to 7.3 °CA for B100 blend compared to 10 °CA for diesel. The heat release rate with biodiesel-diesel blends was lower than base diesel. The duration of combustion for base diesel, B10, B20 and B100 algae biodiesel-diesel blends was found out to be 37.5 ° CA, 38 ° CA, 38 ° CA and 40 ° CA respectively. The carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC) and smoke emissions were reduced significantly as the percentage of biodiesel in fuel blend is increased. The CO emission decreased from 3.10 g/kWh with diesel to 1.20 g/kWh for B100 at full load. The HC emission showed the decrease from 0.06 g/kWh with diesel to 0.04 g/kWh for B100 whereas smoke emission reduced from 0.7% with diesel to 0.6% for B100 at full load. NOx emission with biodiesel and its blends increased significantly. NOx was 16.19 g/kWh and 13.3 g/kWh with B100 and base diesel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of the present research is to investigate the emission characterics of the engine using neem oil methyl ester (N100) with higher alcohol. The N100 is mixed with pentanol by varying the percentage from 10 to 20. The emission parameter such as hydrocarbon(HC), nitrox oxide(NOx) and carbon monoxide(CO) was measured at various load conditions using the gas analyzer. Nitrox oxide and CO content increase with increasing the load but HC content decreases up to half load conditions and then it decreases with increasing load. By doping 20% of pentanol to neem oil biodiesel shows 2.3 and 4.2% reduction in HC and CO than neat biodiesel at all loads respectively. In addition, by doping 20% of pentanol to neem oil biodiesel shows 3.3 and 4.7% reduction in smoke and NOX emissions than neat biodiesel at all loads respectively. Further, the operation of the engine is smooth and no visible damage in engine parts were noticed. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Heterogeneous solid catalysts have been largely developed for biodiesel production, because of their attractive acid-base properties, strong hydrothermal stability, and efficient recovery/reusability. In this framework, developing bio-waste derived heterogeneous catalysts has attracted immense attention for several catalytic applications, owing to their inexpensive, high abundance, non-toxic, and adequate acid-base properties. In the present work, we investigated the catalytic performance of a biomass-derived orange peel ash (OPA), which contains a porous structure, as a raw heterogeneous catalyst for the transesterification of soybean oil to biodiesel. About 98 % conversion of soybean oil to biodiesel was obtained under the optimized reaction conditions i.e., 6:1 methanol:oil ratio, 7 wt. % catalyst loading, 7 h reaction time at ambient reaction temperature, which ascribed to the presence of abundant basic sites in the developed OPA catalyst. The catalyst can be reused for five successive cycles and shows good stability towards the biodiesel production. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this work, activated carbon (AC) powder prepared by lotus leaves was impregnated with CuFe2O4 nanoparticles and the AC/CuFe2O4 nanoparticles were then encapsulated with CaO. Therefore, the AC/CuFe2O4@CaO was used as an efficient and novel nanocatalyst to produce biodiesel from chicken fat. In order to determine the physical characteristics of the AC/CuFe2O4@CaO nanocatalyst, a number of analyses were performed, including Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Energy Dispersive X-Ray (EDX), X-Ray Diffractometer (XRD), Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) and Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) analyses. The results of EDX analysis showed that the catalyst was well synthesized. Also, TEM analysis proved that the catalyst consists of nanoscale particles. In addition, impacts of various factors including methanol/oil molar ratio, catalyst concentration, reaction time and temperature on the produced biodiesel from the chicken fat were investigated. The results showed that the best biodiesel yield of 95.6% could be achieved at a methanol/oil molar ratio of 12:1, catalyst concentration of 3 wt%, reaction time of 4 h, and reaction temperature of 65 °C which was a considerable amount. Moreover, the characteristics of the biodiesel fuel such as density, kinematic viscosity, pour point, flash point, cloud point, Ca content, acid number, and oxidation stability were measured and compared to ASTM D6751 and EN14214 international standards. The results illustrated that biodiesel was not suitable for cold weather, while very good outcomes were observed in terms of the flash point. Besides, biodiesel had density, viscosity, acid number, and oxidation stability within the range of above mentioned standards. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The current work aims at assessing the single cylinder, diesel engine fueled with nano-emulsion of orange peel oil biodiesel. The orange oil was elicited from orange peels through solvent extraction method then converted into methyl ester. By using the solvent extraction method, the orange peel oil (Limonene) yield was achieved up to 82.3%. Later, nanofluid was prepared in two different concentrations by doping 50 and 100 ppm of TiO2 nanoparticles. The orange oil biodiesel nano-emulsions namely OOME-T50 and OOME-T100 were prepared with the proportion of 88% of pure orange oil methyl ester, 10% of TiO2 nanofluid and 2% of span-80 as a surfactant. Experiments were performed with prepared fuels (pure OOME, OOME-T50 and OOME-T100) in a test engine and its results were discussed. The BTE of the engine increased up to 1.4% and 3.0% with OOME OOME-T50 and OOME-T100 fuels when correlated with pure OOME fuel. However, neat diesel fuel indicates maximum BTE at peak load condition. Significant reduction of about 24.2%, 9.7%, 18.4%, 16.0% in smoke, NOx, CO and HC were observed for OOME-T100 nano-emulsion fuel as correlated to pure OOME at peak load. Also, it can be noted that the cylinder peak pressure and heat release rate were increased for OOME nano-emulsion fuels when compared to pure OOME at greatest power output. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is a renewable alternative to “petro-diesel”. There is an established conventional production technology based on refined vegetable oils. However, this is always more expensive than petroleum-based diesel, mainly due to the feedstock cost, and the biodiesel market is based on subsidies. Use of a cheap non-edible feedstock, such as waste shark liver oil (WSLO), would reduce the biodiesel production cost and make the process more economically viable. In this study, production of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) from WSLO using both acid (H2SO4) and base (NaOH) catalysts were investigated using a Design of Experiments approach (response surface methodology). Due to the high levels of FFA (free fatty acids) homogeneous alkali-catalysed transesterification of WSLO was less effective than the acid-catalysed process, resulting in WSLO to FAME conversion of 12% after 60 min, with maximum FAME conversion of about 40% after 15 min. Acid-catalysed WSLO transesterification achieved 99% FAME conversion at 10.3 M ratio of methanol to WSLO, 6.5 h reaction time, 60 °C temperature, and 5.9 wt % of H2SO4 catalyst. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Graphene is known for its superior physical properties and widespread engineering application. The present work investigates the effect of graphene-based nanoparticles, namely graphene oxide (GO) and graphene nanoplatelets (GNP), as fuel additives on the combustion and emission characteristics of a turbocharged diesel engine. This study utilized fossil diesel, karanja and waste cooking biodiesel. The nano additives were amalgamated with diesel and biodiesel blends (B20) at proportions of 20, 40, and 60 ppm. Thermo-chemical and particle characterization of the nano additives were tested using thermal gravimetric analysis, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscope, respectively. The filtration and injector wear characteristics of the nano additive fuel blends were evaluated by filter blocking tendency tester and high-frequency reciprocating rig. A maximum smoke reduction of 29.2% is observed with 40 ppm of GO and 60 ppm of GNP has yielded 26.4% reduction in nitric oxide emission. Among the tested additives, GO shown a lower sooting tendency, whereas GNP has exhibited better emission reduction with respect to NO, CO, and HC. It is concluded that both GO and GNP are attractive fuel additives for better emission control without any consequences on the filterability and injector wear. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This work examines the feasibility of fuelling methyl ester derived from green algae, Chlorella emersonii in a compression ignition engine. This work also proposes Chlorella emersonii methyl ester (CEME) as a potential alternative energy source since the above species is available extensively in fresh water, marine and aquatic ecosystems throughout the world. CEME was blended with petroleum diesel fuel at various volume proportions of 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 100% and their properties were analyzed as per ASTM standards for its application as biofuel. The prepared test fuels were analyzed experimentally in a single cylinder diesel engine at constant speed (1500 rev/min) for its performance, combustion and emission (regulated and unregulated) characteristics. Test results projected that, the characteristics of 20% CEME+80%diesel fuel blend was in par with diesel fuel in terms of thermal efficiency, THC, CO and smoke emissions. However, CEME blends resulted in slightly higher levels of CO2 and NOx emissions. In terms of unregulated emissions, CEME blends in diesel showed lowered toluene and acetaldehyde emissions. However, acetone and formaldehyde emissions increased with higher percentage of CEME in diesel blend. At full load, the attained cylinder pressure and heat release rate of CEME were comparatively lower than diesel fuel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biofuel has emerged as an alternative source of energy to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and combat global warming. Biofuels are classified into first, second, third and fourth generations. Each of the biofuel generations aims to meet the global energy demand while minimizing environmental impacts. Sustainability is defined as meeting the needs of the current generations without jeopardizing the needs of future generations. The aim of sustainability is to ensure continuous growth of the economy while protecting the environment and societal needs. Thus, this paper aims to evaluate the sustainability of these four generations of biofuels. The objectives are to compare the production of biofuel, the net greenhouse gases emissions, and energy efficiency. This study is important in providing information for the policymakers and researchers in the decision-making for the future development of green energy. Each of the biofuel generations shows different benefits and drawbacks. From this study, we conclude that the first generation biofuel has the highest biofuel production and energy efficiency, but is less effective in meeting the goal of reducing the greenhouse gases emission. The third generation biofuel shows the lowest net greenhouse gases emissions, allowing the reduction of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. However, the energy required for the processing of the third generation biofuel is higher and, this makes it less environmentally friendly as fossil fuels are used to generate electricity. The third and fourth generation feedstocks are the potential sustainable source for the future production of biofuel. However, more studies need to be done to find an alternative low cost for biofuel production while increasing energy efficiency. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Here we report a study on the technical feasibility of using purified animal fat as additive in a diesel fuel for internal combustion engines. The objective is to obtain a base fat with contaminant-free and ready to be diluted in petroleum diesel to obtain a diesel fuel blend with acceptable characteristics in terms of engine-system tolerances. A crude fat refining process composed of a vacuum distillation step and a glycerolysis step to convert the free fatty acids (FFA) recovered from distillation step into triglycerides (TAG) is used. Parametric study to determine the optimal purification-process conditions are used. The TAG obtained after a refining step, is then blended with standard diesel. A satisfactory formulation has already been used to power a system-equipped (converted) diesel engine, and blend ratio of up to 40% in standard diesel perform well enough to run the target engine. The results of this study show that this approach is technically feasible and economically interesting for recovering this waste into fuel. Moreover, it permits a decrease of the fuel carbon balance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The exploration for alternative fuels was prompted by increasing environmental concerns, rising conventional fuel prices and fossil fuel depletion. The improved potential of waste cooking oil makes it desirable for its utilization for biodiesel production. In the present study, enzymatic transesterification of waste cooking oil (WCO) is done using lipase enzyme to produce waste cooking oil methyl ester (WCOME) and three different test blends were used namely, Diesel+20% of WCOME, Diesel+40% of WCOME, and Diesel+60% of WCOME. After several trials the optimum reaction factors found to be methanol as the alcohol, 1.5% enzyme concentration (by weight of WCO), 3:1 M ratio and 4 h reaction time. The performance and engine characteristics like as brake specific fuel consumption, brake thermal efficiency, and the emissions of CO, HC, and NOx were analyzed in unmodified compression ignition engine. Test results revealed that the blend with lower biodiesel content performed well in the engine with lowered CO, HC and NOx emissions. But with the higher biodiesel concentrations, there was a considerable increase in the emission spectrum. Overall, Diesel+20% of WCOME and diesel+40% of WCOME blends resulted in improved performance with minimized emissions and can be utilized in an unmodified DI diesel engine. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recalcitrant lignin in the lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) is a major barrier in biofuel production. Thus, its removal from LCB is imperative before conversion into biofuels. Enzyme-mediated degradation of lignin is considered to be a “green approach” as it does not generate any toxic intermediates. Further, enzyme activity may be enhanced by its immobilization onto polymer-coated magnetic nanoparticle support, that enhances anchorage and enables easy recovery for reuse. Hence, in the present study Trichoderma asperellum laccase was immobilized onto Fe3O4@SiO2-chitosan nanosupport for delignification of LCB and subsequently utilized for biohydrogen production. The optimum immobilization conditions determined statistically via response surface methodology were Fe3O4@SiO2-chitosan (58.37 mg), enzyme concentration (24.11 µg), pH (5.95), time (5.3 h) and N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDAC) (1.41%) for maximum immobilization efficiency (92.41%) and yield (91.23%). The immobilized laccase was found to have higher delignification potential than the free enzyme (84.46%), with sweet sorghum stover as substrate, and could be efficiently reused up to 8 cycles. Biohydrogen yield and production rates were 2.8 mol H2/mol reducing sugar and 25 L H2/L-d, respectively, in a continuous stirred tank reactor. Developed Fe3O4@SiO2-chitosan particles have a high potential for use in biohydrogen production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, the density of biofuel is estimated using four intelligent models: a Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM), a Radial Basis Function Artificial Neural Network (RBF-ANN), a Multi-layer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network (MLP-ANN), and an Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). These models are used to estimate the density of biofuel based on intermolecular interactions and the van der Waals radii of the atoms. Various statistical analyses are performed on the original (experimental) and estimated data. It is found that the LSSVM model can provide more accurate predictions than the other three models. The R-squared value (R2) and the mean absolute relative error (MARE) for the LSSVM, RBF-ANN, MLP-ANN and ANFIS models are 0.847 &amp; 0.056, 52.067 &amp; 0.379, 57.385 &amp; 0.371 and 65.096 &amp; 0.678, respectively. This study shows that the LSSVM model is a promising tool for estimating the density of biofuel, offering an alternative to classic thermodynamic models. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Dual-fuel mode in internal combustion engines has been proved as a potential technique for either achieving near-zero pollutant emissions through fuel reactivity modifications or reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by partially replacing a fossil fuel by a renewable one. This manuscript presents an experimental study of a dual-fuel engine fueled with two biofuels, biogas and bioethanol, for two liquid fuel replacements of 20 and 50% by energy. Tests were performed in a spark-ignition single-cylinder engine with a modified compression ratio, under different engine speeds (1800 and 3600 rpm) and loads (4 bar of IMEP and full load condition). Results show that dual-fuel mode accelerated the combustion rate when compared to biogas single-fuel operation and increased combustion completeness, leading to reduced carbon monoxide (CO) and unburnt hydrocarbon (HC) pollutant emissions, thus, improving combustion efficiency. At full load conditions, dual-fuel mode suppressed knock occurrence and raised the load limit for 20% biogas energy fraction when compared to ethanol single-fuel condition. Moreover, nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions were decreased in dual-fuel mode (comparing to ethanol) and fuel conversion efficiencies enhanced considerably. The innovative approach of combining two promising renewable fuels proved to be a very effective methodology in reducing exhaust pollutant emissions and increase engine overall efficiency. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study investigates the phycoremediation potentials of two microalgal consortia (MAC1 and MAC2) for treating sewage water and producing biomass with high lipid, protein and chlorophyll contents. During the study, the microalgal strains were tested for lipid enhancement, biomass production and contaminant removal from wastewater. The microalgal consortia showed prolific growth in wastewater with 75% dilution and accumulated higher lipid content of 31.33% dry cell weight in MAC1. The maximum biomass (50% diluted wastewater) for both the consortia was 1.53 and 1.04 gL−1. Total chlorophyll (19.17–25.17 μg mL−1) and protein contents (0.12–0.16 mg mL−1) for both the consortia were found to be maximum in 75 WW. MAC1 was capable of removing 86.27% of total organic carbon and 87.6% of chemical oxygen demand. Approximately, 94% of nitrate and phosphate contents were removed from the initial contents of wastewater. Heavy metal removal efficiency was also found to be better and showed 85.06% Cu, 75.2% Cr, 98.2% Pb, and 99.6% Cd removal by the algal consortia. Pyrolytic decomposition of algal consortia was observed using thermogravimetric analysis. The stepwise decomposition of algae indicated distinct losses of functional groups. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometric analysis revealed the majority of saturated fatty acids followed by monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Thus, the present study proved that both the consortia show tremendous potential for the treatment of domestic wastewaters with successive lipid enhancement for biodiesel production. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Synthetic biology allows us to bioengineer cells to synthesize novel valuable molecules such as renewable biofuels or anticancer drugs. However, traditional synthetic biology approaches involve ad-hoc engineering practices, which lead to long development times. Here, we present the Automated Recommendation Tool (ART), a tool that leverages machine learning and probabilistic modeling techniques to guide synthetic biology in a systematic fashion, without the need for a full mechanistic understanding of the biological system. Using sampling-based optimization, ART provides a set of recommended strains to be built in the next engineering cycle, alongside probabilistic predictions of their production levels. We demonstrate the capabilities of ART on simulated data sets, as well as experimental data from real metabolic engineering projects producing renewable biofuels, hoppy flavored beer without hops, fatty acids, and tryptophan. Finally, we discuss the limitations of this approach, and the practical consequences of the underlying assumptions failing. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - In the current study, the n-heptanol is mixed with methyl oleate biodiesel fuel at different blends which are 10%, 20% and 40% (by volume) n-heptanol+90%, 80%, 60% methyl oleate fuel (H10B, H20B, and H40B) to examine the combustion and exhaust emission characteristics of a rapid compression-expansion machine (RCEM). The RCEM is operated under diesel engine condition with fixed inlet air properties. The findings for methyl oleate show that the peak pressure is slightly reduced, while soot and NOx emissions are reduced by about 60% and 3% respectively compared to pure diesel fuel. Furthermore, the blending of n-heptanol with methyl oleate fuel leads to a considerable reduction in the soot emission by about 75% and the NOx emission is reduced by 6% compared to pure methyl oleate fuel. The flame images confirm that there is a reduction in flame temperatures for methyl oleate compared to pure diesel fuel. Additionally, the combustion process is retarded with increasing the blending ratio of n-heptanol in the fuel mixture. Based on the combustion and emission characteristics, the recommended blending ratio of n-heptanol and methyl oleate fuel is H20B. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Physicochemical characteristics of three type biodiesel feedstock and diesel engine parameters fuelled with graphene oxide (GO) nanoparticles addition in diesel/biodiesel blends have been investigated. Three types of oilseeds, namely Evening primrose (Oenothera lamarckiana), the fruit of Tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima) and Camelina (Camelina sativa), were selected as suitable resources for Iran. The result showed that the Tree of heaven contains 38% oil which is higher than the Evening primrose (26%) and Camelina (29%). Physicochemical properties of the oils showed that the viscosity of the Camelina oilseeds was less than the Tree of heaven oilseeds and Evening primrose oilseeds. Therefore, in terms of viscosity, the Camelina oilseeds is preferable. Experimental results showed that the biodiesel from all three types of oilseeds are consistent with the ASTM biodiesel standards. However, Camelina biodiesel has better physicochemical properties than another feedstock. Therefore, biodiesel of Camelina oil can be an appropriate alternative to diesel fuels in Iran. Performance and emission parameters of diesel engine fuelled with graphene oxide (GO) nanoparticles addition in three biodiesel resources compared with diesel. A reduction in UHCs, CO, and BSFC with a penalty of increased NOx emissions was realized with all graphene oxide (GO) nanoparticles addition in diesel/biodiesel blends. Also, with Camelina biodiesel, the power increased. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Perceiving and detecting a sustainable source of energy is very critical issue for current modern society. Hydrogen on combustion releases energy and water as a byproduct and has been considered as an environmental pollution free energy carrier. From the last decade, most of the researchers have recommended hydrogen as one of the cleanest fuels and its demand is rising ever since. Hydrogen having the highest energy density is more advantageous than any other fuel. Hydrogen obtained from the fossil fuels produces carbon dioxide as a byproduct and creates environment negative effect. Therefore, biohydrogen production from green algae and cyanobacteria is an attractive option that generates a benign renewable energy carrier. Microalgal feedstocks show a high potential for the generation of fuel such as biohydrogen, bioethanol and biodiesel. This article has reviewed the different methods of biohydrogen production while also trying to find out the most economical and ecofriendly method for its production. A thorough review process has been carried out to study the methods, enzymes involved, factors affecting the rate of hydrogen production, dual nature of algae, challenges and commercialization potential of algal biohydrogen. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - One of the major properties of biodiesel fuels is cetane number (CN) which expresses the ignition characteristics and quality of motor power. The main idea of this work was proposing an accurate model for estimation of the cetane number of biodiesel in terms of fatty acid methyl esters composition. In doing so, least-square support vector machine (LSSVM) approach was coupled with Genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and hybrid of GA and PSO (HGAPSO) algorithms and a total number of 232 samples of fuels were extracted from literature. The coefficient of determination (R2), mean relative errors (MREs), mean squared errors (MSEs) and standard deviations (STD) were calculated for evaluation of the models. The R2 values in the testing phase for LSSVM-GA, LSSVM-PSO, and LSSVM-HGAPSO were estimated by 0.965, 0.966 and 0.978 respectively. The statistical and graphical analyses showed that the LSSVM algorithm coupled with GA, PSO or HGAPSO algorithms can be used as an accurate model for estimation of the cetane number of the biodiesel fuels. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present study, the feasibility of utilizing Musa spp “Pisang Awak” peduncle derived ash as a highly effective renewable heterogeneous basic catalyst for transesterification of underutilized non-edible Ceiba pentandra oil (CPO) was investigated. The physiochemical characteristics of the calcined banana peduncle (CBP) were studied by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive Atomic X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDAX). Biodiesel was produced by a two-step esterification-transesterification process. In the first step, FFA content of the oil was reduced from 7% to 1.6% using reaction conditions of 1.0 vol% H2SO4 concentration, 1h reaction time, 1:4 v/v methanol to oil volumetric ratio with constant reaction temperature of 60 °C. In the second step, response surface methodology (RSM) using central composite design (CCD) was employed to determine the optimal process conditions of transesterification process variables. Based on the RSM results, the optimum process conditions for transesterification of CPO into fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) was found to be 1.978 wt% catalyst concentration, 60 min reaction time, 9.20:1 methanol to oil molar ratio with a maximum predicted FAME yield of 99.36% which was evaluated experimentally as 98.69 ± 0.18%. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This research investigates the behavior of ethanol and biodiesel, blended with diesel fuel in a multiple injection engine. Numerical study and engine simulation were carried out using ESE Diesel environment of AVL Fire. The simulations were conducted for 10 and 20% biofuel blends and also, 20 and 30% pilot injection and for two different injection timings. Heat release rate and pressure were compared to the studies in the literature. Agreement between pressure charts was very good while it was acceptable for the heat release rate. For the first case, the injection started at 695 CA while for the second one, it started at 700 CA. The duration of injection for both injection stages lasted 10 CA degree with a dwell angle of 15 CA. According to the results, unlike biodiesel combustion, ethanol combustion resulted in lower chamber temperature and lower NOx emission subsequently. The effect of pilot injection percentage on emissions and heat release rate significantly depends on the injection timing. And finally, as injection start changed from 695 to 700, a noticeable reduction was observed in engine performance and emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The quest for efficient and sustainable route for biodiesel production motivates the investigation of synergies between microwave reactor and calcium oxide (CaO) loaded on zeolite in waste lard biodiesel (WLB) production. The optimum concentration of the precursor used in the impregnation of the zeolite was practically determined. The resultant CaO/zeolite was characterized using some classical techniques and the characterized catalyst in synergy with the microwave reactor was used to optimize and model the biodiesel production process and the reaction optimum conditions in relation to CaO/zeolite amount, microwave power, methanol/oil ratio and time as independent variables were established (8% (wt./vol), 595 Watts, 30:1 and 1.25 h respectively) using central composite design. The conditions generated a maximum WLB yield of 90.89% signifying that the synergies between the reactor and the synthesized catalyst result in an efficient biodiesel production method. Additionally, the catalyst is shown to be easily separated from the reaction product and has the potential to be recycled a number of times under the optimum conditions. This study establishes synergies between microwave reactor system and heterogeneous CaO/zeolite catalyst that result in an economically feasible route for production of an efficient and sustainable WLB. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - It is obvious that Iran agricultural industry, unlike Brazil and USA, cannot afford to provide conventional biomass, i.e. sugary or starchy biomass for bioethanol production, mainly due to climatic and geographic conditions. With some exception of date (fruit), first-generation ethanol production triggers food vs. fuel debates in Iran and put nation to hunger. Agricultural products including apple, barley, carrot, corn, grape, orange, potato, rice, sugar beet, sugarcane, and wheat are consumed domestically, exported, or even lost because of poor harvesting and processing conditions such as transportation or packaging. These products may alone generate 21.56 million ton per annum green wastes upon processing in the food industry. Every year about 5.4 billion liters of bioethanol can be produced by establishing second-generation ethanol plants next to the food processing sectors. Seventy-seven-percent of this amount of bioethanol can easily support 5% ethanol (E5) policy to phase out the consumption of 4.2 billion liters methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) for raising the octane number of gasoline in the country. If more comprehensive policy is adopted, larger quantities of lignocellulosic feedstocks can be gathered from agro as well as forestry practices. Second-generation bioethanol technology can help Iran to tackle air pollution in its big cities and to address the adverse effects of MTBE on its populations and ecosystem. The other advantages are improvement of fuel security, mitigation of climate change, and development of economy. The motivation can be created through passing a framework policy to cut fossil fuel subsidies, to mandate bioethanol blends in gasoline, and to impose carbon taxes. Development of coherent socially and environmentally relevant strategies and facilitation of investment in bioethanol industry are also necessary. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present research, application of waste edible oil (WEO) as a suitable and abundant source for biodiesel production using CaO@MgO nanocatalyst derived from waste chicken eggshells was studied. To this end, FT-IR, XRD, SEM, EDX, Map, and TEM analyses were performed to investigate characteristics of the CaO@MgO nanocatalyst. Also, the physical properties of the biodiesel such as flash point, kinematic viscosity, density, distillation point, cloud point, pour point, cetane number, oxidation stability, and acid number were determined according to the international standards. In addition, FT-IR and HNMR analyses were used to determine the biodiesel characteristics. Moreover, the produced catalyst was successively reused for up to 6 cycles and the results showed that the catalytic activity of the catalyst produced was sufficient for biodiesel production from WEO for up to three cycles, beyond which its catalytic activity decreased. The present work further considered the effects of different parameters on biodiesel production using central composite design to determine optimal conditions. According to the results, the highest biodiesel conversion yield (98.37%) was achieved in a reaction time of 7.08 h, reaction temperature of 69.37 °C, methanol-to-oil ratio of 16.7:1, and catalyst concentration of 4.571 wt% which shows the highest biodiesel conversion yield ever achieved from waste edible oil. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Development of solid mixed oxide catalyst from waste biomass is a scarcely studied area. Thus, present protocol aims to prepare an environmentally friendly, efficient, renewable and recyclable heterogeneous base catalyst from Carica papaya stem. The chemical and structural properties of the catalyst were examined by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffractograms (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis. The CO2-TPD and Hammett indicator test was conducted to determine the basicity of the prepared catalyst. The study revealed the presence of alkali and alkaline earth metals that provide the basic sites to facilitate transesterification reaction for biodiesel production and formation of benzylidenemalononitrile (BMN). The conversion of the waste cooking oil (WO) and Scenedesmus obliquus (SO) lipid to biodiesel was confirmed by the NMR and Gas chromatography Mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS) technique. Biodiesel conversions of 95.23% and 93.33% were achieved using 2 wt % catalyst loading under optimized reaction conditions for WO and SO respectively. Reusing the catalyst showed a slight drop in activity after 6 repeated uses. The reported catalyst has shown its potential as an alternative and cheaper green solid catalyst for biodiesel production and Knoevenagel reaction. © 2019

AB  - The ever increasing population growth and rapid utilization of petroleum based fossil fuels have induced several crucial environmental problems, such as air pollution, ozone depletion, global warming, acid rain, forest destruction and emission of radioactive substances. In this study, the vegetable oils such as refined palm stearin (non-edible oil), has been converted into methyl ester with an aid of transesterification reaction. Chemically, transesterification means conversion of triglyceride molecule or a complex fatty acid into alcohol and ester by removing the glycerin and neutralizing the free fatty acids. The B20 blend samples [80% diesel + 20% biodiesel] were prepared for each methyl ester obtained from refined palm stearin oil and then the cerium oxide nanoparticles are added to the each B20 blend samples at a dosage of 50 ppm and 100 ppm with an aid of ultrasonicator. Moreover, in the absence of any engine modifications, the performance and emission characteristics of those blend samples have been investigated from the experimentally measured values such as density, viscosity, cloud point, pour point and calorific value while the engine performance was also analyzed through the parameters like exhaust gas temperature (EGT), brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), brake thermal efficiency (BTH), exhaust emission of CO, HC, NOx and smoke opacity. The experimental results reveal that the use of biodiesel blend in diesel engine has exhibited better combustion, good improvement in performance characteristic and reduction in exhaust emissions. © 2020 National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources (NISCAIR).

AB  - This paper deals with artificial neural network (ANN) modelling of a diesel engine using cottonseed methyl-ester (CME) to predict brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), maximum in-cylinder pressure (CPmax) and exhaust emissions (CO, HC, and NOx). To acquire data for training-testing (75%–25%) of the proposed ANN, a single-cylinder diesel engine was fueled with different percentages of CME (B0, B10, B20 and B50) and then operated at different engine loads (2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 Nm) and injection pressures (175, 190, 205, and 220 bar). Depending on the increase of CME content in the CME-diesel blend, BSFC sharply increased due to the lower heating value of biodiesel. As the engine load increased, HC slightly increased. More oxygen atoms in biodiesel lead to reduce CO emissions owing to more complete combustion. In addition, NOx gradually increased due to high combustion temperature at high engine loads, particularly more for biodiesel-content fuels. Further, the lower cetane number of CME resulted in higher CPmax due to rapid combustion of accumulated fuel in the combustion chamber. On the other hand, three metrics of success, namely MEP, RMSE, R2, were discussed for evaluation the success of the developed ANN model in the study. In the result, the developed ANN model is able to predict CO, HC, NOx, CPmax, and BSFC quite well with R2 of 0.9902, 0.9990, 0.9999, 0.9979, and 0.9995, respectively. Moreover, each RMSE and MEP values for both training and testing set were less than 0.04 and 9%, respectively. In the conclusion, this paper is clearly reporting that ANN can be applied to accurately predict the engine performance, combustion and emissions of CI engines. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The purpose of this study was the improvement of cold flow and lubricity characteristics of biodiesel produced from the palm-sesame oil blend. Extreme learning machine (ELM) and response surface methodology (RSM) techniques were used to model the production process and the input variables (time, catalyst amount, methanol to oil ratio, and duty cycle) were optimized using cuckoo search algorithm. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), coefficient of determination (R2), mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), and standard error of prediction (SEP) were calculated to evaluate the performance of RSM and ELM. The results showed that ELM model had better performance in prediction than RSM model. The optimum yield of P50S50 biodiesel obtained was 96.6138% under operating parameters of time (38.96 min), duty cycle (59.52%), methanol to oil ratio (60 V/V %) and catalyst amount (0.70 wt%). The cold flow characteristics of P50S50 biodiesel are significantly improved like cloud point (7.89 °C), pour point (3.80 °C), and cold filter plugging point (- 1.77 °C) with better oxidation stability 6.89 h. The average coefficient of friction P50S50 biodiesel was lower than palm biodiesel (B100) and B10 commercial diesel by 2.29% and 12.37% respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study focuses on combustion, emission, and performance analysis of JET-A fuel blends with various additives using a micro gas turbine engine. The amount of oxygen in fuel blends and atomization are the crucial parameters in the production of a higher combustion rate with less emission. Therefore, various ratios of additives (ethanol and pentanol) are blended with biofuel (rapeseed and canola-sunflower oil) to form the JET-A fuel blends by using Kay's and Grunberg-Nissan mixing rules. The combustion, performance and emission parameters under different engine loads were examined. Results showed that all the blends logged higher static thrust with an appreciable reduction rate in the consumption of the fuel. Among different fuel blends, R20E (Jet-A 70% fuel, 20% Rapeseed, and 10% ethanol) showed 35% increase in static thrust associated with 41% reduction in thrust specific fuel consumption. Moreover, the blends R20E and CS20E (Jet-A fuel 70%, Canola- Sunflower 20% and 10% ethanol) indicated 24% and 10% increase in thermal efficiency respectively due to the influence of ethanol concentration and higher oxygen content. In addition, these fuel blends generate less emission of environmental unfriendly harmful gases, including NOx, CO, and HC, compared to neat Jet-A fuel. Results revealed that the exergy destruction values are higher for the combustion chamber than the other conventional fuel components. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of Sargassum tenerrimum (ST) macroalgae was carried out for 15 min, over various solid base catalysts (CaO supported on CeO2, Al2O3, and ZrO2) at different reaction temperatures (260–300 °C), different catalyst quantities (5–25 wt%) and using different solvent systems. Maximum bio-oil (BO) yields for the non-catalytic HTL with single solvent water, ethanol, and water-ethanol co-solvent were 3.3 wt%, 23.3 wt%, and 32.0 wt%, respectively, at 280 °C. Ethanol as single solvent elicited highest BO yield of 25.2 wt% with CaO/ZrO2 (10.0 wt%) catalyst. However, the highest BO yield (33.0 wt%) accompanied by higher conversion (70.5%) was obtained with CaO/ZrO2 (10.0 wt%) under water-ethanol co-solvent. The selectively higher percentage of ester functional compounds (87.8%) was found with CaO/ZrO2 catalyst under water-ethanol co-solvent. Also, the bio-oil obtained from catalytic liquefaction showed a higher high heating value (HHV) compared to that from the non-catalytic HTL reaction. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study is an effort to optimize the production of biodiesel from dairy scum and Hydnocarpus wightiana oil using Snail shell CaO nanocatalyst for transesterification. Response surface methodology is used to optimize the reaction parameter that affects the transesterification process for the biodiesel yield. The CaO nanocatalyst was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, Fourier Transformer Infrared Spectroscopy, Thermo Gravimetric/Differential Thermal Analysis and Atomic Force Microscopy. The maximum biodiesel yield for Scum Oil Methyl Ester and Hydnocarpus wightiana Oil Methyl Ester was (96.929%) and (98.93%) at the optimized condition: Methanol to oil molar ratio 12.7:1 and 12.4:1, catalyst dosage of 0.866 wt.% and 0.892 wt.%, reaction temperature 58.56°C and 61.6°C and reaction time 119.684 min and 145.154 min respectively. A comprehensive kinetic study for the transesterification reaction was performed at different temperatures (50-65°C) for the methanolysis of SO and HWO catalyzed by CaO nanoparticles. A pseudo-first order kinetic reaction was established and the activation energy (Ea) and frequency factor (A) for SO and HWO to be 67.21kJmol-1 & 5.182×108 min-1 & 73.15 kJmol-1 & 4.59×109 min-1 respectively. Recovered CaO nanocatalyst is reused for 5 times with substantial loss in biodiesel yield. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Rapid depletion in fossil fuels, inflation in petroleum prices, and rising energy demand have forced towards alternative transport fuels. Among these alternative fuels, diesel-ethanol and diesel-biodiesel blends gain the most attention due to their quality characteristics and environmentally friendly nature. The viscosity and density of these biodiesel blends are slightly higher than diesel, which is a significant barrier to the commercialization of biodiesel. In this study, the density and viscosity of 30 different ternary biodiesel blends was investigated at 15 °C and 40 °C, respectively. Different density and viscosity models were developed and tested on biodiesel blends soured from different feedstock's including palm, coconut, soybean, mustard, and calophyllum oils. The prognostic ability and precisions of these developed models was assessed statistically using Absolute Percentage Error (APE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The MAPE of 0.045% and 0.085% for density model and 1.85%, 1.41%, 3.48% and 2.27%, 1.85%, 3.50% for viscosity models were obtained on % volume and % mass basis. These developed correlations are useful for ternary biodiesel blends where alcohols are the part of biodiesel blends. The modeled values of densities and viscosities of ternary blends were significantly comparable with the measured densities and viscosities, which are feasible to avoid the harm of vehicles' operability. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Lignocellulosic ethanol has been proposed as a green alternative to fossil fuels for many decades. However, commercialization of lignocellulosic ethanol faces major hurdles including pretreatment, efficient sugar release and fermentation. Several processes were developed to overcome these challenges e.g. simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF). This review highlights the various ethanol production processes with their advantages and shortcomings. Recent technologies such as singlepot biorefineries, combined bioprocessing, and bioenergy systems with carbon capture are promising. However, these technologies have a lower technology readiness level (TRL), implying that additional efforts are necessary before being evaluated for commercial availability. Solving energy needs is not only a technological solution and interlinkage of various factors needs to be assessed beyond technology development. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Municipal solid waste (MSW) is one of the issues associated with the growth of economic and urban population. The aim of this study is to develop an integrated design of waste management systems in support of a Circular Economy by P-graph (a bipartite graphical optimisation tool) as an effective decision support tool. The case study considers four MSW compositions based on different country income levels. Solving the P-graph model identifies the most suitable treatment approaches, considering the economic balance between the main operating cost, type, yield, quality of products, as well as the GHG emission (externality cost). The identification of near-optimal solutions by P-graph is useful in dealing with the trade-offs between conflicting objectives, e.g. local policy and practical implementation, that are difficult to monetise. For a lower-income country, the optimal solution includes a combination of at source separation, recycling, incineration (heat, electricity), anaerobic digestion (biofuel, digestate) and the landfill. It avoids an estimated 411 kg CO2eq/t of processed MSW and achieves a potential profit of 42 €/t of processed MSW. The optimisation generally favours mechanical biological treatment as the country income level rises, which affects the composition of the MSW. The relative prices of biofuel, electricity and heat (&gt;20%) cause a significant impact on the highest-ranking treatment structure and overall profit. This study shows that the developed framework by P-graph is an effective tool for MSW systems planning. For future study, localised data inputs can be fed into the proposed framework for a customised solution and economic feasibility assessment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Highly selective β-methylation of alcohols was achieved using an earth-abundant first row transition metal in the air stable molecular manganese complex [Mn(CO)2Br[HN(C2H4PiPr2)2]] 1 ([HN(C2H4PiPr2)2]=MACHO-iPr). The reaction requires only low loadings of 1 (0.5 mol %), methanolate as base and MeOH as methylation reagent as well as solvent. Various alcohols were β-methylated with very good selectivity (&gt;99 %) and excellent yield (up to 94 %). Biomass derived aliphatic alcohols and diols were also selectively methylated on the β-position, opening a pathway to “biohybrid” molecules constructed entirely from non-fossil carbon. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction proceeds through a borrowing hydrogen pathway involving metal–ligand cooperation at the Mn-pincer complex. This transformation provides a convenient, economical, and environmentally benign pathway for the selective C−C bond formation with potential applications for the preparation of advanced biofuels, fine chemicals, and biologically active molecules. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - From the perspective of renewability and environmental pollution, biodiesels are appropriate alternatives to conventional diesel fuels due to their proper combustion behavior and atomization characteristics, which can be influenced by the viscosity as an essential factor. Therefore, the viscosity prediction would be of importance for blend of biodiesel/diesel fuels. For biodiesel/diesel mixtures, the blended viscosity has been predicted with numerous empirical correlations available in the literature. In this work, the viscosity of fuel mixtures was evaluated through Generalized regression neural network (GRNN), Radial Basis Neural Networks (RBFNN), Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN), and Cascade Feed-forward Neural Network (CFNN), based on various experimental data. These developed models were then compared in terms of predictive accuracy and available empirical correlations to select the best model. Finally, the proposed model was compared with the most prominent biodiesel viscosity models confirming that the developed model has been superior in predicting the value of viscosity for biodiesel blends with reported values of 0.9997 and 0.87% for parameters of the coefficient of determination (R2) and absolute average relative deviation (AARD%), respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This research, the effects of the spirulina microalgae biodiesel (SMB) blends containing 20, 40, 60 and 80% in volume based were investigated in a naturally aspirated diesel engine at various loads. The performance, combustion and emission analyses showed that of the injection timings (23.0° b TDC) with higher injection pressure of 220 bar. The results show that SMB1 (20% of spirulina microalgae biodiesel and 80% diesel) produces lower exhaust emission and cylinder pressures, brake thermal efficiency (BTE), exhaust temperature and maximum rise pressure rates as compared to diesel fuel. Specific fuel consumption and ignition delay period results increased up to 3.3%, 8.2% and BTE reduced up to 3.03% when the spirulina microalgae blend was increased to 20% at the higher load. The SMB blends also resulted in lower nitrogen oxides (NOX) emission by 4.9%, particulate matter (PM) emission by 20.7% as well as lower smoke by 5.4%, but CO2 emissions increased for all loads. The results showed that addition spirulina microalgae produced a lower of brake thermal efficiency and exhaust temperature, the CO2 emission were improved. Hence, spirulina microalgae can be used in diesel engine. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Transition and decarbonization of the energy sector require the utilisation of new technologies and energy sources. Higher penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources implies the installation of energy storage, to store electricity excess and enhanced system efficiency. These electricity surpluses that will occur more often in the future energy system could be effectively utilized for the production of alternative fuels. Most of the alternative fuels that are considered for future applications are already known chemicals or products, nowadays used for other purposes. Another great advantage of some alternative fuels lies in their possibilities to act as an energy carrier. This feature might be crucial while discussing their utilisation potential and further development. Fuels which can simultaneously be used for power generation and as an energy carrier will have a more important role in the future and are likely to be utilized on a greater scale. Renewable energy source like biomass, on the other hand, is already widely used, and their role in the future system is not questionable. Even though significant increment in biomass consumption raises serious concerns about its sustainability, and seeks for new approaches. In this work, the authors tried to review alternative fuel characteristics, alongside their utilisation and production opportunities. To come up with the optimal solutions, the authors compared various proposed alternative fuels, alongside their advantages and drawbacks with an aim to find the most appropriate role for each fuel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present study, the effects of graphene oxide (GO) nano-particles on performance and emissions of a diesel engine fueled with Oenothera lamarckiana biodiesel was investigated. Biodiesel was used in the blend of B20. The GO nano-particles with concentrations of 30, 60, and 90 ppm were considered for each fuel blend. Experiments were performed at a constant speed of 2100 rpm at loads of 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%. Various parameters, such as power, exhaust gas temperature (EGT), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), unburned hydrocarbons (UHCs), and nitrogen oxides (NOx), were investigated. Results showed that by using GO, power and EGT significantly increase. Furthermore, by using GO nano-particles, significant reductions in CO (∼5%–22%) and UHCs (∼17%–26%) were observed. However, under similar conditions, a slight increase in CO2 (∼7%–11%) and NOx (∼4%–9%) emissions observed. Finally, it can be concluded that nano-graphene oxide can be introduced as a suitable alternative fuel additive for Oenothera lamarckiana biodiesel blends. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The escalating consumption of fossil fuels and dumping of palm kernel shells (PKS) drives biofuel production to improve supply and waste disposal. To convert PKS into modified biochar (MBC) value-added solid fuel, we use microwave vacuum pyrolysis accompanied by sodium-potassium hydroxide mixture modification. First, PKS underwent microwave vacuum pyrolysis to produce biochar, and then it was chemically activated using sodium-potassium hydroxide mixture. The MBC surface morphology, porous characteristics, proximate content, and energy properties depended on microwave irradiation period and power. High yields (79 ± 1.5 wt%) were recorded at microwave power 700 W and irradiation period of 10 min, giving a high BET surface area (1320 m2/g) and pore volume (0.70 cm3/g). The MBC had acceptable low content of ash, nitrogen, and no sulphur, demonstrating its potential as an environmental friendly fuel to replace conventional coal in combustion. The MBC shows high energy yield (≤90.5%), fuel ratio (≤26.47), and heating value (≤28.69 MJ/kg) comparable to conventional fuels, thus showing desirable solid fuel properties. Energy balance analysis shows positive energy ratio of up to 10 and net energy output of up to 24.47 MJ/kg, recovering a product with a higher energy content compared to electrical power input for the pyrolysis operation. These findings demonstrate the exceptional potential of the MBC produced by this innovative approach for bioenergy generation that per se will reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases and thereby reducing global warming and climate change. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study details the enhancement in combustion, performance, and emission characteristics of SB fueled diesel engine by using water emulsion (10% and 20%) and CNT nanoparticle (100 ppm). The biodiesel was prepared from soybean crude oil by trans-esterification process, and the fuel properties were measured. Experiments were performed in a single cylinder, four-stroke, and natural aspirated stationary diesel engine under varying BMEP conditions. The measured fuel properties of SB, 10WSB, and 100CNT10WSB are at par with standard limits, whereas 20WSB and 100CNT20WSB viscosity values are not par with standard limits. Studies in the engine revealed that the combustion starts later for water/biodiesel blends, and ICP, NHR, and RPR are higher compared to pure SB. The nanoparticle inclusion with emulsion fuels reduces the peak ICP and NHR values. Emulsion fuels show a good improvement in BSFC, BSEC, and EGT when compared to pure SB, and the nanoparticle inclusion further improves the performance parameters. The emission characteristics of test fuels show that the water/biodiesel blends have a lower magnitude of NOx and smoke emissions, and 10WSB shows better HC and CO emissions when compared to SB and 20WSB. An inclusion of CNT nanoparticle further reduces the emissions level. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work aims to investigate the effect of the addition of water to corn oil biodiesel (BD) (COBD) in a diesel engine to view its effect on performance and emission characteristics. Two fuel samples were prepared using a novel surfactant Span 80 (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA), with different concentrations (94 % corn oil + 4 % water + 2 % Span 80 (COBDE1) and 90 % corn oil + 8 % water + 2 % Span 80 (COBDE2)). Experimental results showed that the water samples of COBD had higher brake thermal efficiency and lower brake-specific fuel consumption than that of neat COBD at all engine brake power. In addition, smoke and nitrogen oxide emissions are reduced by 4-11 % and 6-10 % using corn oil-water samples compared to neat COBD. Furthermore, the introduction of COBD-water emulsions in a diesel engine reduces the unburned hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions considerably.

AB  - The application of pesticides reduces the loss of crops while simultaneously increasing crop productivity. However, the frequent use of pesticides can cause serious environmental problems due to their high accumulative and persistent nature. Recently, microalgae technology has received considerable success in the efficient treatment of pesticides pollution. In this review, the metabolic mechanisms responsible for the removal of pesticides are summarized based on previous studies. Different methods used to enhance the ability of microalgae to remove pesticides are critically evaluated. The recycling of microalgae biomass after wastewater treatment for biochar preparation and biodiesel production using the biorefinery approach is also introduced. Furthermore, we present potential future research directions to highlight the prospects of microalgae research in the removal of pesticides along with the production of value-added products. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Fischer–Tropsch (FT) synthesis has been investigated over decades as an alternative route to obtain synthetic fuels from synthesis gas. FT is a high-performance synthesis based on metallic catalysis, mainly using ruthenium, cobalt and iron catalysts, which converts syngas in hydrocarbons and chemical precursors. This work presents a review on the aspects of the syngas production from biomass gasification and its subsequent conversion into fuels through the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The usage of biomass, including lignocellulosic residues, as a raw material in the gasification process. Biosyngas is highlighted as a synthetic fuel source to replace nonrenewable, conventional fossil fuels. Lignocellulosic material must be considered a low-cost feedstock to the liquid biofuel production on a large scale. Studies on syngas cleaning to attain the purity required by the FT process is revised. Recent understanding of reaction kinetics and thermodynamics has contributed to increasing the FT performance and economic viability. This paper includes also the debate on main catalysts, industrial process requirements, and chemical reaction kinetics and mechanisms of Fischer–Tropsch synthesis. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - This study is intended to examine the ignition characteristics of a cashew nut shell biodiesel (C100) along with ethyne (acetylene) as a dual fuel in a diesel engine. Cashew nut shell oil is employed in this study owing to non-toxic nature, free from sulphur, biodegradable, and free of aromatics. Ethyne gas was introduced at different flow rate of 2, 4, 6 litres per minute (lpm). Experimental results revealed that duel fuelling ethyne gas to base fuel (C100) at 6 lpm reduce 18.1% CO, 9.7% HC, 6.87% Smoke with 11.1% increase in NOx emissions. Higher thermal efficiency was observed for ethyne–biodiesel mixture than neat biodiesel in all flow rates. Furthermore, the heat release and peak pressure were enhanced by duel fuelling ethyne gas to base fuel (C100). © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Fossil fuel continued overuse and carbon emissions issues have prompted increased research efforts on sustainable and renewable energy sources as alternative to fossil fuels. Biofuels include products derived from biomasses or their residues, such as: biogas, biodiesel, bioethanol, biomethanol, synthetic biofuels, biohydrogen and vegetable oil. Due to their properties, all of these may be used in conventional engines as produced, or blended with fossil fuels. First and second generation biofuels may be produced from a large variety of feedstocks, including food crops such as sugar beet, sugar cane, sorghum, energy-crops, such as lignocellulosic masses, and waste, like the organic fraction of municipal solid waste, or landfill leachate. In the last decade, a third generation of biofuels has emerged, i.e. those derived from microalgae. Even though their yield is higher, and their greenhouse gas footprint lower than previous generations’, they still need large amounts of water and nutrients for production. In this paper, the most common biofuels (biogas, syngas, biodiesel, bioetha-nol and biobutanol) are reviewed and analyzed with particular attention on their carbon and water footprints and economic sustainability perspective. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Hydrogen is recognized as a key source of the sustainable energy solutions. The transportation sector is known as one of the largest fuel consumers of the global energy market. Hydrogen can become a promising fuel for sustainable transportation by providing clean, reliable, safe, convenient, customer friendly, and affordable energy. In this study, the possibility of hydrogen as the major fuel for transportation systems is investigated comprehensively based on the recent data published in the literature. Due to its several characteristic advantages, such as energy density, abundance, ease of transportation, a wide variety of production methods from clean and renewable fuels with zero or minimal emissions; hydrogen appears to be a great chemical fuel which can potentially replace fossil fuel use in internal combustion engines. In order to take advantage of hydrogen as an internal combustion engine fuel, existing engines should be redesigned to avoid abnormal combustion. Hydrogen use in internal combustion engines could enhance system efficiencies, offer higher power outputs per vehicle, and emit lower amounts of greenhouse gases. Even though hydrogen-powered fuel cells have lower emissions than internal combustion engines, they require additional space and weight and they are generally more expensive. Therefore, the scope of this study is hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engines. It is also highlighted that in order to become a truly sustainable and clean fuel, hydrogen should be produced from renewable energy and material resources with zero or minimal emissions at high efficiencies. In addition, in this study, conventional, hybrid, electric, biofuel, fuel cell, and hydrogen fueled ICE vehicles are comparatively assessed based on their CO2 and SO2 emissions, social cost of carbon, energy and exergy efficiencies, fuel consumption, fuel price, and driving range. The results show that when all of these criteria are taken into account, fuel cell vehicles have the highest average performance ranking (4.97/10), followed by hydrogen fueled ICEs (4.81/10) and biofuel vehicles (4.71/10). On the other hand, conventional vehicles have the lowest average performance ranking (1.21/10), followed by electric vehicles (4.24/10) and hybrid vehicles (4.53/10). © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Depletion of fossil fuel sources and their emissions have triggered a vigorous research in finding alternative and renewable energy sources. In this regard, algae are being exploited as a third generation feedstock for the production of biofuels such as bioethanol, biodiesel, biogas, and biohydrogen. However, algal based biofuel does not reach successful peak due to the higher cost issues in cultivation, harvesting and extraction steps. Therefore, this review presents an extensive detail of deriving biofuels from algal biomass starting from various algae cultivation systems like raceway pond and photobioreactors and its bottlenecks. Evolution of biofuel feedstocks from edible oils to algae have been addressed in the initial section of the manuscript to provide insights on the different generation of biofuel. Different configuration of photobioreactor systems used to reduce contamination risk and improve biomass productivity were extensively discussed. Photobioreactor performance greatly relies on the conditions under which it is operated. Hence, the importance of such conditions alike temperature, light intensity, inoculum size, CO2, nutrient concentration, and mixing in bioreactor performance have been described. As the lipid is the main component in biodiesel production, several pretreatment methods such as physical, chemical and biological for disrupting cell membrane to extract lipid were comprehensively reviewed and presented. This review article had put forth the recent advancement in the pretreatment methods like hydrothermal processing of algal biomasses using acid or alkali. Eventually, challenges and future dimensions in algal cultivation and pretreatment process were discussed in detail for making an economically viable algal biofuel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, microwave irradiation-assisted transesterification was used to produce Ceiba pentandra biodiesel, which accelerates the rate of reaction and temperature within a shorter period. The improvement of biodiesel production requires a reliable model that accurately reflects the effects of input variables on output variables. In this study, an extreme learning machine integrated with cuckoo search algorithm was developed to predict and optimize the process parameters. This model will be useful for virtual experimentations in order to enhance biodiesel research and development. The optimum parameters of the microwave irradiation-assisted transesterification process conditions were obtained as follows: (1) methanol/oil ratio: 60%, (2) potassium hydroxide catalyst concentration: 0.84%(w/w), (3) stirring speed: 800 rpm, and (4) reaction time: 388 s. The corresponding Ceiba pentandra biodiesel yield was 96.19%. Three independent experiments were conducted using the optimum process parameters and the average biodiesel yield was found to be 95.42%. In conclusion, microwave irradiation-assisted transesterification is an effective method for biodiesel production because it is more energy-efficient, which will reduce the overall cost of biodiesel production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd
