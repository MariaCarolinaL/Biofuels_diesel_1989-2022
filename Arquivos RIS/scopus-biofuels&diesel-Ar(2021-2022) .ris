AB  - In this study, acid-treated golden apple snail shells (Pomacea canaliculata)-derived calcium oxide (CaO_tr) were used as a high-performance catalyst for the transesterification of palm oil and waste cooking oil (WCO) because the golden apple snail shells were found in plenty in Thailand, and they were also the major pest of rice. The obtained final materials were calcined in air at 800 °C for 3 h referred by TGA analysis denoting as CaO_tr catalyst. All of the catalysts were characterized and tested by using several techniques including XRD, EDX, SEM, basic strength by Hammett indicator method, total basic site by TPD-CO2, and BET specific surface area by N2 adsorption. The results indicated that the CaO_tr had a specific surface area of 7.5544 m2/g and it was higher than CaO_un approximately 2 times. The kinetics of the reaction followed pseudo-first-order with the rates constants of reaction (k) equal 1.35☓10-2 min-1 for the reaction which catalyzed by acid-treated golden apple snail shells-derived CaO catalyst (CaO_tr), while un-treated golden apple snail shells-derived CaO catalyst (CaO_un) gave k value of 1.18☓10-2 min-1, respectively. Under the optimal of reaction conditions at catalyst loading of 5 wt. %, methanol/oil molar ratio of 12:1, reaction temperature 65 °C, and 5% v/v relative to the amount of methanol of THF as a co-solvent; more than 97% yield of biodiesel could be achieved in 150 min by using CaO_tr. The final part, biodiesel product obtained from palm oil and WCO catalyzed by CaO_tr catalyst has high quality and meets the specified standards of biofuels for the diesel engines both of the EN-14214 and ASTM-D6751 standard testing method. Thus, the utilization of the acid treatment method for enhancement of the catalytic activity of CaO catalyst from golden apple snail shells and the applied co-solvent method for increase the performance of biodiesel production was a process with a high potential in the biodiesel production for the community scale and industrial scale. © 2022, Paulus Editora.

AB  - Microalgal biomass has been proved to be a sustainable source for biofuels including bio-oil, biodiesel, bioethanol, biomethane, etc. One of the collateral benefits of integrating the use of microalgal technologies in the industry is microalgae's ability to capture carbon dioxide during the application and biomass production process and consequently reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Although microalgae are a feasible source of biofuel, industrial microalgae applications face energy and cost challenges. To overcome these challenges, researchers have been interested in applying the bio-refinery approach to extract the important components encapsulated in microalgae. This review discusses the key steps of microalgae-based biorefinery including cultivation and harvesting, cell disruption, biofuel and value-added compound extraction along with the detailed technologies associated with each step of biorefinery. This review found that suitable microalgae species are selected based on their carbohydrate, lipid and protein contents and selecting the suitable species are crucial for high-quality biofuel and value-added products production. Microalgae species contain carbohydrates, proteins and lipids in the range of 8% to 69.7%, 5% to 74% and 7% to 65% respectively which proved their ability to be used as a source of value-added commodities in multiple industries including agriculture, animal husbandry, medicine, culinary, and cosmetics. This review suggests that lipid and value-added products from microalgae can be made more economically viable by integrating upstream and downstream processes. Therefore, a systematically integrated genome sequencing and process-scale engineering approach for improving the extraction of lipids and co-products is critical in the development of future microalgal biorefineries. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The depletion of fuel production and raising ecological issues have paid the progress of biofuels in the entire world. Among different biofuels is introducing renewable fuel additives as prospective beneficial blendstocks towards fulfilling systematic, low-carbon technologies internal combustion engines. This research article proposes a new approach to formulate a Fuzzy modeling for examining various promising alternative renewable oxygenated compounds, including ethanol, isopropanol, MTBE, and 2-methyl furan into heavy hydrocracked gasoline a base fuel. No previous study has utilized Fuzzy modeling in formulation of producing high octane fuel based on renewable additives compounds. The effect of selected additives was investigated on the antiknock characteristics. The results reported that the quality and quantity of heavy hydrocracked naphtha have been reinforced, using low carbon oxygenates. Besides, the acquired results provided the possibility to determine the optimum range of selected renewable oxygenates percentages of 30–50% wt. The calculated data of Fuzzy modeling were verified with experimental results. It illustrated that predicted environmental gasoline yields agreed well with experimental results. Finally, low carbon liquid fuel could contribute to produce high quality environmental gasoline, improve environmental characteristics, in terms of decreasing greenhouses emissions, and maximize the vehicles technologies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This work reports the development and application of a molecularly imprinted electrochemical sensor based on the electropolymerization of pyrrole film on glassy carbon electrode for monitoring mercaptan sulfur in aviation biofuel. To this end, butanethiol was used as a template molecule for the formation of imprinted cavities in the polypyrrole structure. The modified electrode was characterized by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. After the optimization of the experimental conditions, the sensor presented linear working ranges in the concentration range of 1.0 × 10−12 to 1.0 × 10−10 mol L−1. The values obtained for the amperometric sensitivity and the limits of detection and quantification of this device were 5.1 × 105 A L mol−1, 6.1 × 10−13 mol L−1, and 2.0 × 10−12 mol L−1, respectively. The proposed sensor showed excellent selectivity, remarkable repeatability and high stability for butanethiol detection. The proposed electroanalytical method was successfully applied in aviation biofuel sample where it exhibited recovery values between 98% and 107%, with relative standard deviation ranging from 1.1% to 4.1%. The results obtained show that the proposed sensor has good accuracy and can be successfully applied for monitoring mercaptan sulfur in aviation biofuel samples. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Compatibility between automotive materials and biodiesel is key for engine manufacturers, since failures occur in the medium term and may significantly reduce engine useful life. There are only few studies about compatibility between biodiesel and pure materials, but all agree there is biodiesel degradation and material corrosion beyond desirable values. This manuscript shows results about the compatibility behavior of an indirect injection diesel engine injector, with different types of biodiesel (from rapeseed, soybean, coconut and palm oil). Tests were carried out by static immersion of actual injector parts inside biodiesel, at room temperature, during 1100 h. To analyze elemental composition of each injector part and potential compatibility problems, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were used. Visual variations were detected in both biodiesel and metals, showing the need of a further quantification of both piece mass loss and biodiesel acid value increase. Metallic oxides on the surface were detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). After immersion tests, mass variation in alloying elements of each piece (behaving differently depending on their composition), besides biodiesel acid value differences, were found. In this sense, pieces with aluminum alloys showed the highest corrosion (mass loss) compared to those without aluminum in their structure, no matter the unsaturation degree and chain length of biodiesel. In sum, there were not conclusive results about the influence of biodiesel composition over injector materials. However, it was found that European biodiesel standard EN 14214 should include other parameters than just copper band corrosion, to determine material deterioration, provided that aluminum alloys and other metals react with biodiesel. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Owing to the greatest need and continuous requirement of the fossil fuel, the immediate search of alternate resources to the petroleum fuel is essential. This research deals with the production and utilization of waste cooking oil biodiesel and nanoparticles blends in the direct ignition engine. The nanoparticles added blends was then reinforced with hydrogen flow while conducting the tests. The fuel blends used for the tests were D100 (pure diesel), B10 (90% diesel + 10% biofuel), B20 (80% diesel + 20% biofuel), D100T10 (pure diesel with 100 ppm nanoparticles), B10TH (90% diesel + 10% biofuel with 100 ppm nanoparticles + 5 L/min of H2) and B20T10 (80% diesel + 20% biofuel with 100 ppm nanoparticles + 5 L/min of H2). While conducting the tests, the hydrogen flow was given at the constant mass flow rate of 10 L/min. The performance and emission measures were keenly calculated from the tests. All tests were conducted at different speeds from 1800 rpm to 2800 rpm. The performance parameters were improved by these nanoparticles and hydrogen together with the pure diesel and also with the biodiesel blends. For example, the power, torque and brake thermal efficiency were improved while the brake specific fuel consumption was decreased. The main objective of reducing the emission of CO, CO2 and other UHC was satisfied whereas the NO emission was slightly increased. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The continuous growing demand for fossil fuel puts an enormous pressure on finding a better replacement. This research paper explores the detailed information on the improved production, emission and performance characteristics of the distinct bio-oil derived from the micro algae of Schizochytrium. The algae were grown in the artificial seawater with enough nitrogen supply at the required standard conditions. The lipid growth and production of the bio-oil were monitored closely and measured. Different fuel blends were used at different concentrations as B0 (100% Diesel), B10 (10% schizochytrium biofuel +90% diesel), B20 (20% schizochytrium biofuel +80% diesel) and B30 (30% schizochytrium biofuel +70% diesel). A small single cylinder, four stroke diesel engine was used to conduct the tests. All tests were conducted at different speed conditions of 1200 rpm to 2100 rpm in six intervals. The performance qualities of bio-oil such as CO, NOX, and smoke and CO2 emission along with the performance qualities of brake thermal efficiency and brake specific fuel consumption. Form the results, the Schizochytrium microalgae bio-oil as the bio fuel for diesel engines in the moderate level showed the improved performance by increasing the BTE and reducing the harmful gas emissions except NOX. However, the emission level of NOX was slightly higher than the diesel emitted value. The difference between them was negligible. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Global environmental awareness has encouraged further research towards biofuel production and consumption. Despite the favorable properties of biofuels, the sustainability of their conventional production pathways from agricultural feedstocks has been questioned. Therefore, the use of non-food feedstocks as a promising approach to ensure sustainable biofuel production is encouraged. However, the use of synthetic solvents/chemicals and energy carriers during biofuel production and the consequent adverse environmental effects are still challenging. On the other hand, biofuel production is also associated with generating large volumes of waste and wastewater. Accordingly, the circular bioeconomy as an innovative approach to ensure complete valorization of feedstocks and generated waste streams under the biorefinery scheme is proposed. In line with that, the current study aims to assess the environmental sustainability of bioethanol production in a safflower-based biorefinery using the life cycle assessment framework. Based on the obtained results, safflower production and its processing into 1 MJ bioethanol under the safflower-based biorefinery led to damage of 2.23E-07 disability-adjusted life years (DALY), 2.35E-02 potentially disappeared fraction (PDF)*m2*yr, 4.76E-01 kg CO2 eq., and 3.82 MJ primary on the human health, ecosystem quality, climate change, and resources, respectively. Moreover, it was revealed that despite adverse environmental effects associated with safflower production and processing, the substitution of conventional products, i.e., products that are the typical products in the market without having environmental criteria, with their bio-counterparts, i.e., products produced in the biorefinery based on environmental criteria could overshadow the unfavorable effects and substantially enhance the overall sustainability of the biorefinery system. The developed safflower-based biorefinery led to seven- and two-time reduction in damage to the ecosystem quality and resources damage categories, respectively. The reductions in damage to human health and climate change were also found to be 52% and 24%, respectively. The weighted environmental impacts of the safflower-based biorefinery decreased by 64% due to the production of bioproducts, mainly biodiesel and biogas, replacing their fossil-based counterparts, i.e., diesel and natural gas, respectively. Finally, although the main focus of the developed safflower-based biorefinery was biofuel production, waste valorization and mainly animal feed played a significant role in improving the associated environmental impacts. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Mustard waste briquettes are commercially used as a fuel for power production in boilers, whereas the thermal kinetics of the biomass plays a vital role in deciding the process parameters. The pyrolysis process converts biomass to value-added products such as biochar, bio-oil, and hydrocarbon gases based on the heating rates and temperature. To enhance the pyrolytic activity of mustard biomass, magnetically separable and reusable FeNi alloy catalyst is investigated. The thermo-conversion properties are studied under variable heating rates with 2 and 10% FeNi particles prepared through a facile chemical reduction technique. Thermal kinetics is computed using Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FOW) and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) methods. The activation energies calculated using FOW and KAS methods increase with FeNi addition in mustard while the calorific value decreases. The FeNi alloy particles with the spike-like morphology provide better metal-biomass binding resulting in higher activation energy and facilitates the easy decomposition of lignin. The 10% FeNi -mustard shows uniform conversion independent of heating rates, suitable for magnetically recoverable catalytic pyrolysis. Response surface methodology analysis predicts optimum conversion for 10% FeNi added mustard and less significance for the heating rates in concurrence with the experiments. Artificial neural network utilized to predict and validate mass loss for mustard biomass exhibits best fit for the three neural hidden layer and one output layered topology. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Depletion of non-renewable feedstock and severe wastewater pollution due to human activities have created negative impact to living organisms. The potential solution is to implement wastewater treatment and bioelectricity production through algae-based microbial fuel cell. The algae biomass produced from microbial fuel cell could be further processed to generate biofuels through their unique compositions. The consumption of nutrients in wastewater through algae cultivation and biomass produced to be utilized for energy supply have showed the potential of algae to solve the issues faced nowadays. This review introduces the background of algae and mitigation of wastewater using algae as well as the bioenergy status in Malaysia. The mechanisms of nutrient assimilation such as nitrogen, phosphorus, carbon, and heavy metals are included, followed by the application of algae in microbial fuel cell's chambers. Lastly, the status of algae for bioenergy production are covered. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study offers a promising energy conversion platform to valorize food waste into biodiesel. In an effort to realize this grand challenge, black soldier fly larvae (BSFL), fast food waste consumer, were directly converted into biodiesel through non-catalytic transesterification. Black soldier fly (BSF: Hermetia illucens) is a widely distributed insect, which turns nutrients in food waste into its fat body (lipid) through the simple metabolic mechanisms in the larval stage. Thus, lipid in BSFL grown on food waste was obtained by liquid/liquid extraction, and the extract was converted into biodiesel (93.8 wt% yield) at 65 °C for 8 h by base-catalyzed transesterification. However, non-catalytic transesterification of the extract of BSFL showed 94.1 wt% of biodiesel yield after 1 min of reaction at 390 °C in the presence of a porous material (SiO2). This non-catalytic reaction was also employed for direct conversion of dried BSFL into biodiesel without lipid extraction. In the later part of this study, fuel properties of the BSFL derived biodiesel were measured to evaluate its fuel feasibility. Physical and chemical properties of the biodiesel measured in this study met the Korea and EU biodiesel fuel standards. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Alcohols could be the biggest factor for the improvement of world biofuel economy in the present century due to their excellent properties compared to petroleum products. The primary concerns of sustainable alcohol production for meeting the growing energy demand owing to the selection of viable feedstock and this might enhance the opportunities for developing numerous advanced techniques. In this review, the valorization of alcohol production from several production routes has been exposed by covering the traditional routes to the present state of the art technologies. Even though the fossil fuel conversion could be dominant method for methanol production, many recent innovations like photo electrochemical synthesis and electrolysis methods might play vital role in production of renewable methanol in future. There have been several production routes for production of ethanol and among which the fermentation of lignocellulose biomass would be the ultimate choice for large scale shoot up. The greenhouse gas recovery in the form of alcohols through electrochemistry technique and hydrogenation method are the important methods for commercialization of alcohols in future. It is also observed that algae based renewable bio-alcohols is highly influenced by carbohydrate content and sustainable approaches in algae conversion to bio-alcohols would bring greater demand in future market. There is a lack of innovation in higher alcohols production in single process and this could be bounded by combining dehydrogenation and decarboxylation techniques. Finally, this review enlists the opportunities and challenges of existing alcohols production and recommended the possible routes for making significant enhancement in production. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Necessity and exploitation of fossil fuels is unstoppable in meeting humanity's needs despite being a small and scarce resource. The use of different renewable feedstock materials are vital in the satisfaction of large-scale demand for renewable energy sources without creating environmental problems in order to satisfy energy demand. In this context we covered the production of biofuels from a variety of feedstocks using pyrolysis, direct blending, micro-emulsion, trans-esterification (biodiesel production techniques) and hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, methanogenesis (biogas production techniques) and pyrolysis, thermochemical liquefaction (bio-oil production techniques) along with the focus on increasing biofuel production using nanocatalysts and biochar-based catalysts and the techniques for creating those catalysts. Torrefaction, pyrolysis, hydrothermal carbonization, hydrothermal liquefaction, and gasification are the key methods used to make biochar. Slow pyrolysis and hydrothermal carbonisation are the best methods to produce high-yield biochar. Biochar's catalytic activity is influenced by pyrolysis temperature, pyrolysis time, transition metals, and biomass to water mass ratio. However, there are some noteworthy challenges associated with biofuel development. The cost of feedstock and the option of convenient technology for efficient fuel production, the availability of commercially viable nanoparticles, a biological understanding of the nanomaterial and protein system, and microorganism compatibility levels involving enzymes and nanomaterials are all discussed repeatedly. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - As interest in biofuel blends has grown through the years, especially in terms of jet fuel blend development, it has become more and more important to be aware of their physical chemical properties. One of them is the Flash Point (FP), which is intimately related to the flammability of the blend. With this in mind, the aim of this study was to determine experimentally and also mathematically new FP data on binary and ternary solutions containing ethanol, fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE), and dodecane, as a way of providing data for flammability evaluation of jet fuels based on surrogates. Therefore, FPs of seventeen binary systems and eight ternary systems were measured. A vapor pressure approach was employed to FP prediction with NRTL and original UNIFAC activity coefficient models in order to further analyze flammability in terms of solution behavior, while providing guidance for FP prediction of these systems, needed for fuel development. NRTL binary interaction parameters were adjusted from FP data, as these parameters are not available in the literature for FAEE multicomponent systems. It was observed that addition of ethanol to dodecane or FAEEs steeply decreases FP. On the other hand, addition of FAEEs to dodecane does not affect FP as drastically, which implies an almost ideal behavior for these systems. Both the original UNIFAC and NRTL models were able to improve FP prediction in comparison to the ideal model for all ternary systems with RMSDs ranging from 4.6 K to 0.5 K and 1.3 K to 0.3 K respectively, which points to the validity of the adjusted NRTL parameters. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The production of biofuel from waste has become an important topic for waste management and reducing its environmental hazard. Tea factory waste is a strong candidate due to its availability and sourceability. This study aimed to reveal the biochemical methane potential (BMP) of tea factory waste (TFW) and spent tea waste (STW). Additionally, the results revealed that both substrates had high biodegradability due to high VS removal. The BMP tests took 49 days under mesophilic conditions with a batch reactor and the cumulative methane yields were 249 ± 3, and 261 ± 8 mL CH4/g VS for TFW and STW, respectively. According to prediction data with the selected ANN model, which was 50 hidden layer sizes, trained with Bayesian Regularization algorithm, the maximum cumulative specific methane yield of the co-digestion was simulated as 468.43 mL CH4/g VS when the ratio of 65 and 35% (w/w by VS) of TFW and STW, respectively. The predicted methane yield for co-substrates was 183% higher than mono substrates. This result revealed that TFW can be a good candidate for biogas production as biofuel for not only its availability and sourceability but also the synergistic effect possible for co-digestion. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fuel components were prepared in this study using rubber seed oil via photothermal catalysis under energy-saving conditions. Modified TiO2 was employed as the catalyst in the catalytic reactions. X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), hydrogen temperature-programmed desorbtion (H2-TPD), CO pulse chemisorption analysis, and UV–vis spectroscopy were employed to examine the microstructure and chemical properties of the modified catalysts. The loading of the catalysts with different active metals considerably reduced the bandgap, leading to enhancements in the absorption of visible light. Temperature, H2 pressure, and reaction time were optimised for the photothermal catalytic reaction via the single factor test. The Pt/TiO2 catalyst realised the highest conversion and selectivity among the tested samples at 120 °C and a H2 pressure of 0.4 MPa for 12 h. Additionally, photo-decarboxylation was confirmed via probing with oleic acid to be the predominant process in the catalytic reaction. This research provides an energy-saving strategy for the preparation of biofuels. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, a novel hybrid system was designed and constructed encompassing a biomass culture medium (BCM), ground source heat pump (GSHP), concentrated solar collector (CSC), active solar distiller (ASD), and bio-oil/biodiesel reactor (BBR). The freshwater was supplied by a combination of ASD/BCM systems to maintain the salinity level. A GSHP system was also employed to control the BCM temperature. Saltwater was introduced to the ASD after cultivation for salinity control of the BCM. Various growth temperature, salinity levels, and CO2 injection were tested for the cultivation of Nannochloropsis oculata to reach maximum biomass production of 3.17 × 106 ± 0.50 × 105 cells/mL on the 8th day. The cellular concentration of microalgae was measured by image processing which can precisely (R2 = 0.88) assess the concentration by imaging the cultured samples. Finally, the efficiency of biofuel-to-biodiesel conversion of the BBR section was studied in terms of time, catalyst concentration, and temperature, which was obtained 80.4%. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The detailed investigation of biodiesel premixing is done in this research in order to make an attempt to reduce greenhouse gas emission, particularly NOx. From the literature survey, it is found that the effect of premixing is not concentrated enough and significant effect of it is yet to be analyzed. The impact of the biofuel premixing on the performance, combustion and emission characteristics was analyzed numerically. Numerical modelling was applied to do such analysis. The simulation for the combustion process in the combustion chamber was done to validate the comparison of a number of cases of different fuel. During the simulation process different fuel conditions were considered. A set of tests was carried out to find the premixing quality. Initially, pure diesel as fuel and the mixture of plain diesel and biodiesel were used to perform the tests. Secondly, biodiesel as fuel and its blends were used but the premixing was done. Similarly, another combination of pure diesel and plain premixed biodiesel in the combustion chamber was also analyzed. The different proportions of the fuel conditions are D (pure diesel), B10, B20 and B100 with B20%, B40% and B60% premixing biodiesel. The premixing effect was also identified by using both without premixing and with premixing fuel conditions in the combustion chamber. The reduced smoke emission was achieved by using the premixed fuels in the chamber in the second case. However, the emission of NOx was increased. Similarly, in the case of plain diesel as fuel and plain biodiesel as premixed fuel, the amount of smoke was reduced significantly but there was no high increment in the emission of NOx. Premixing biodiesel with the combination of pure diesel as the primary fuel provided the improved torque and power output whereas the reduced BSFC. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Alternative fuels have recently been researched on diesel substitution, with the target of reducing dependence on petroleum-based fuel in addition to reducing environmental pollution. Thanks to its regenerability and ability to absorb emissions, the opted biofuel tends to be advantageous. The present study explored the autoignition behaviour, in particular the ignition delay and process of combustion that strongly influence exhaust emissions. The analysis used biodiesel blends obtained from palm oil, waste cooking oil, algae, jatropha and tyre pyrolysis oil at various blending ratio from 2% to 20%. These blending ratios were achieved independently through a specific blending technique with pure diesel at different volumetric concentrations. The ignition delay was assessed by means of a rapid compression machine (RCM) under variant injection pressure at an elevated ambient temperature of the reaction chamber. This study discovered significant differences in ignition delays and combustion efficiency when different biodiesel blends were operated under higher injection pressures and higher ambient temperatures. The shortest ignition delay of biodiesel blend fuels is achieved at low blending concentrations, implying that lower concentrations of biodiesel encapsulate a lower fuels viscosity, preceded by excellent spray atomization, premixing, and ignitability. In addition to these implications, the shortest ignition delay was undoubtedly influenced by higher injection pressure and higher temperature conditions in which the expansion of the fuel's molecular bound to the C[sbnd]H bonding deteriorates and bonding energy dissociates. Emissions are lower than pure diesel with an increased concentration of blends; waste cooking oil-biodiesel blends experienced positive effects on the CO, HC and nitrogen oxides (NOx) via variant injection pressure; while significant improvements in HC were noticed for most fuels, corresponding to the elevated ambient temperature circumstances. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study demonstrates the co-hydrodeoxygenation of partially upgraded bio-oil (PUB) obtained from hydrothermal liquefaction of pinewood, with rapeseed oil (RO) to produce bio-derived drop-in fuel. Enhanced miscibility of PUB in RO showed the high potential of HTL bio-oil for co-processing with different refinery streams in existing refineries. Co-processing experiments were conducted in a continuous unit under different processing conditions and the obtained results were compared with the hydroprocessed oils produced from the pure RO. Temperature and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) are found to be important parameters to achieve complete deoxygenation and controlling the properties of co-processed bio-oils. Product quality analysis of co-processed bio-oils obtained under optimized conditions showed no oxygen contents and micro carbon residue but high n-paraffins. Furthermore, boiling point distribution of co-processed bio-oils was measured by SimDis, which was found analogous to boiling range of biodiesel. Fuel characteristic properties such as flash point, pour and cloud points of co-processed bio-oils were also measured and found improved compared to the properties of hydroprocessed oil obtained from RO. Therefore, this study demonstrates that HTL bio-oil can be successfully co-processed with renewable feed and petroleum refinery streams in a continuous hydroprocessing unit without any modification to reduce the environmental impacts and overcome the cost, availability and sustainability issues of oleochemical based feedstocks. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Due to global concern on the sustainability of energy from fossil fuels, isobutanol as a biofuel has urged attention in recent years due to its high octane number, higher blending capacity, low vapour pressure and higher energy content. The present study reports a novel wild strain, Candida glabrata, which produces isobutanol under submerged fermentation condition. Different process parameters have been optimized by both conventional as well as statistical methods. The production of isobutanol is enhanced in the presence of valine and this attribute the degradation pathway of valine is highly depend on isobutanol production. Under optimized condition, the yield of isobutanol is increased from 0.19 g/L to 0.96 g/L. This strain has not yet reported for the production of isobutanol. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Here we compare the biomass feedstock use, primary energy use, net CO2 emission, and cumulative radiative forcing of passenger cars powered by different energy pathways. We consider the full lifecycle of the vehicles, including manufacture and operation. We analyze battery electric vehicles (BEVs) powered by standalone electricity generation using woody biomass, with and without CCS, and with integration of wind electricity. We analyze internal combustion vehicles (ICVs) powered by fossil gasoline and by biomethanol derived from woody biomass, with and without carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). Our system boundaries include all fossil and biogenic emissions from technical systems, and the avoided decay emissions from harvest residue left in the forest. We find that the pathways using electricity to power BEVs have strongly lower climate impacts, compared to the liquid-fueled ICV pathways using biomethanol and gasoline. The pathways using bioelectricity with CCS result in negative emissions leading to global cooling. The pathways using gasoline and biomethanol have substantial climate impact, even with CCS. Regardless of energy pathway, smaller cars have consistently lower climate impact than larger cars. These findings suggest that accelerating the current trend toward vehicle electrification, together with scaling up renewable electricity generation, is a wise strategy for climate-adapted passenger car transport. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - International shipping accounts for around 2 % of global CO2 emissions. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set the ambition to halve shipping GHG emissions by 2050 to help mitigate climate change. As shipping connects countries and sectors, its future development is highly dependent on regional and sectoral trends. So far, the literature on the decarbonization of shipping has focused on sectoral analyses while integrated assessment models (IAMs) have paid little attention to this matter. In this study, the IMAGE model is used to assess different futures of energy, agricultural and industry impacting the effort required to meet IMO's target for 2050. To that end, long-term seaborne trade projections are created from outputs of the IMAGE model. The results show that varying pathways of socio-economic development strongly affect the size of the sector. The mass shipped globally ranges from 17 to 35 Gt/yr in 2050. This corresponds to an energy demand between 9 and 25 EJ in the same year, which would require significant amounts of low-carbon fuels. Interestingly, in a climate policy scenario, the avoided trade of fossil energy, although partially compensated by an increase of biofuel trade, lowers the international shipping mitigation effort. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the transportation sector, the share of biofuels such as biodiesel is increasing and it is known that such fuels significantly affect NOx emissions. In addition to NOx emission from diesel engines, which is a significant challenge to vehicle manufacturers in the most recent emissions regulation (Euro 6.2), this study investigates NO2 which is a toxic emission that is currently unregulated but is a focus to be regulated in the next regulation (Euro 7). This manuscript studies how the increasing share of biofuels affects the NO2, NOx, and NO2/NOx ratio during cold-start (in which the after-treatment systems are not well-effective and mostly happens in urban areas). Using a turbocharged cummins diesel engine (with common-rail system) fueled with diesel and biofuel derived from coconut (10 and 20% blending ratio), this study divides the engine warm-up period into 7 stages and investigates official cold- and hot-operation periods in addition to some intermediate stages that are not defined as cold in the regulation and also cannot be considered as hot-operation. Engine coolant, lubricating oil and exhaust temperatures, injection timing, cylinder pressure, and rate of heat release data were used to explain the observed trends. Results showed that cold-operation NOx, NO2, and NO2/NOx ratio were 31–60%, 1.14–2.42 times, and 3–8% higher than the hot-operation, respectively. In most stages, NO2 and the NO2/NOx ratio with diesel had the lowest value and they increased with an increase of biofuel in the blend. An injection strategy change significantly shifted the in-cylinder pressure and heat release diagrams, aligned with the sudden NOx drop during the engine warm-up. The adverse effect of cold-operation on NOx emissions increased with increasing biofuel share. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: The objective of this study was to evaluate the environmental impact of the production of a range of liquid biofuels produced from the combination of fermenting sorghum stalk juice (bioethanol) and the pyrolysis/hydrotreatment of residual bagasse (renewable gasoline and diesel). Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) was performed on a farm-to-wheels system that included: (i) sorghum farming, (ii) juice extraction, (iii) juice fermenting, (iv) bagasse pretreatment, (v) bagasse thermochemical treatment (pyrolysis, hydroprocessing, and steam reforming), and (vi) typical passenger vehicle operation. LCIA results were compared to those of petroleum fuels providing the equivalent functional unit—cumulative kilometers driven by spark ignition direct injection (SIDI) vehicles utilizing either renewable gasoline or ‘bioE85—a blend of bioethanol and renewable gasoline,’ and a compression ignition direct injection (CIDI) vehicle utilizing renewable diesel produced from 76 tons of harvested sweet sorghum (1 ha). Results: Sweet sorghum biofuels resulted in a 48% reduction climate change impact and a 52% reduction in fossil fuel depletion. Additionally, reduced impacts in ozone depletion and eutrophication were found (67% and 47%, respectively). Petroleum fuels had lower impacts for the categories of non-carcinogenic health impact, smog, respiratory effects, and ecotoxicity, showing tradeoffs between sorghum and petroleum fuels. Conclusion: Overall, sorghum biofuels provide advantages in environmental impact categories including global warming potential, fossil fuel depletion and eutrophication, showing potential for sorghum as a promising second-generation feedstock for fuel. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - As the production of biofuels increase, there is an urgent need to easily analytically control their production at the plant level as well as to assess the quality of the final products. Especially method capable of determining fatty acid ethyl ester content of 96.5% is crucial for utilization in praxis. In this work, a refractive index method with required sensitivity was developed and validated by means of a standard reference gas chromatography method. Validation with a considerable set of real unique samples obtained at pilot scale was performed for both purposes – process monitoring at high conversions and final product quality control. The results confirmed a favourable degree of accuracy with a relative deviation lower than 3.5% from the reference value given by the gas chromatography. Moreover, application of the method for quality control of fresh and long-term stored samples revealed that the deterioration of final products during storage can be detected. The developed refractive index method is thus suitable for the simple and rapid evaluation of the quality of produced fatty acid ethyl esters and for analytical monitoring of their production process. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Microalgae farming has gained interest because of the heavy processing requirement of non-renewable fuel sources and increased vegetable oil prices that prevent them from being used for biodiesel production. Chlorella varibilis MK039712.1, a freshwater microalga with 24.0 ± 0.6% w/w lipid was isolated from Valparai, Coimbatore district, Tamil Nadu, India, that was dried, lysed to extract it for biodiesel production. The present study aims to produce biodiesel from the Chlorella variabilis MK039712.1 algal oil by optimizing the transesterification conditions by varying catalyst concentration, methanol to oil molar ratio, time, temperature using Response Surface Methodology. At 8:1 methanol to algal oil molar ratio, 0.3 wt % of catalyst, 65 °C reaction temperature and 120 min reaction time, a maximum of 96% biodiesel yield was obtained. The variations in chemical structure of the transesterified algal oil was analyzed using Fourier Transform Infra-Red Spectroscopy, 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and 13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. The fuel properties were also determined and found comparable with the ASTM standards. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Based on the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), oxygenated biofuels have become one of the research focuses of engines. Past research has concentrated on the high temperature combustion mode (blend fuel), and low temperature combustion modes (RCCI and ICCI). However, the combined investigations of blend fuel, RCCI and ICCI modes to compare engine combustion and emission characteristics has not been reported. Therefore, the present work focus on the comparison of engine combustion and emission characteristics of the three different combustion modes in a diesel engine at different engine loads, energy ratio and EGR rates using butanol and biodiesel. Results show that blend fuel has higher indicated thermal efficiency than ICCI and RCCI modes at low load, while RCCI and ICCI modes exhibit better engine performance at medium load, which is more suitable for using of ICCI and RCCI modes under practical engine. Significantly higher load of ICCI mode can be operated is another important finding of this study, which demonstrates that ICCI mode has greater potential to expand the engine load than RCCI mode and blend fuel, in which RCCI mode cannot be operated at higher load due to the unacceptable combustion noise. Nitrogen oxides emissions of RCCI and ICCI modes reduced 92% to 95% than blend fuel using EGR, but emits higher incomplete combustion products. In addition, properly increasing the butanol energy ratio increase the combustion efficiency for the three combustion modes, it will reduce the thermal efficiency and increase pollutant emissions at higher butanol energy ratio. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To have a sustainable economy and environment, several countries have widely inclined to the utilization of non-fossil fuels like biomass fuels to produce heat and electricity. The advantage of employing biomass for combustion is emerging as a potential renewable energy, which is regarded as a cheap fuel. Chemical constituents or elements are essential properties in biomass applications, which would be costly and labor-intensive to experimentally estimate them. One of the criteria to evaluate the energy of biomass from an economic perspective is the higher heating value (HHV). In the present work, we have applied multilayer perceptron artificial neural network (MLP-ANN), least-squares support vector machine (LSSVM), ant colony-adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ACO-ANFIS), particle swarm optimization- ANFIS (PSO-ANFIS), genetic algorithm-radial basis function (GA-RBF) and new multivariate nonlinear regression (MNR) as accurate correlation methods to estimate HHVs of biomass fuels based on the ultimate analysis. 535 experimental data were gathered from literature and categorized into eight classes of by-products of fruits, agri-wastes, wood chips/tree species, grasses/leaves/fibrous materials, other waste materials, briquettes/charcoals/pellets, cereal and Industrial wastes. In the term of statistical analysis, average absolute relative deviation (AARD) authenticates that MNR and GA-RBF algorithm with %AARD of 3.5 and 3.4 could be used to estimate HHV. In addition, developed models results were compared to the results of 69 recently previously published empirical correlations and it confirms the reliability of our results. Relevency factor shows the impact of biomass elements on HHV and outlier analysis indicates the unreliable experimental data. The results of this study can be used by researchers to design and optimize biomass combustion systems. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present work describes an example Life Cycle Thinking (LCT), focused on environmental aspects of LCT. More in details, for biofuels, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is compulsory for certification of industrial sites since their sustainability must be in line with the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) requirements. Eni's Green Refinery is an example of the application of LCT. The paper describes a process, at R&D level, for biofuel production from lignocellulosic biomass deriving from crops not in conflict with the food sector. In particular, the process allows to obtain sugars from these lignocellulosic biomasses (saccharification section) and, once recovered, these sugars are used by oleaginous microrganisms (yeasts) in fermentations (fermentation section) for their growth. The lipids contained in yeast cells are recovered to produce a microbial oil that could be processed in an Ecofining™ plant, producing HVO (Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil). The environmental impact of advanced HVO has been compared with other biofuels pathways and with RED to prove its environmental sustainability. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - With the continuous rise in fuel prices and the depletion of fossil fuel resources, the alternative biofuel which has good stability and is suitable for engine combustion is the focus of scientists' research. In this study, the method of mixing ethanol with palm oil (PO) and palm kernel oil (PKO) was used to improve the shortcomings of PO/PKO, such as high surface tension, high density and viscosity. Five co-solvents with a biological production background are selected: tetrahydrofuran (THF), polyoxymethylene dimethyl ether (PODE) and three butanol isomers to aid solubility. The results show that with the continuous dripping of the co-solvent, the PO/PKO and the ethanol gradually dissolve each other until the emergence of a single-phase liquid. Among the five co-solvents, the order of solubilization is THF > PODE > n-butanol > 2-butanol > iso-butanol. Also, with the increase in temperature, the solubility-assisting ability increases. When the particle size of the ternary blended fuel microemulsion system reaches the maximum value of 59.65 nm, the composition ratio of ethanol in the basic system is 50%. In addition, PKO has a stronger affinity with ethanol than PO; PKO can be completely miscible with ethanol when the experimental temperature is 35 °C. As the proportion of ethanol increases, the surface tension of the ternary system decreases by 36.2% at most. In terms of fuel property adjustment, THF has the best adjustment effect on solubility and viscosity. Butanol has the best adjustment effect on the density of blended fuel. PODE will corrode copper strips due to high oxygen content. In the future, according to the fuel demand in different scenarios, the proportion of each component in the blended fuel can be adjusted to achieve the optimum in practical applications. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biofuels are considered renewable sources of energy which can replace fossil fuels using naturally extracted fuels from the environment to fulfil growing demands for energy in developing countries. This paper aims to select a suitable province for producing biodiesel from Jatropha plants in new climate conditions of Iran using the additive ratio assessment method (ARAS). Previous feasibility studies lack the environmental factor when considering the cultivation of Jatropha plants in Iran. In this work, the relevant main selecting criteria were identified through using a literature review. Then, the most effective criteria were chosen and categorised as environmental, social and economical factors. The weighting of the criteria was determined by Shannon entropy method and using expert opinions. Next, the ARAS method was used for prioritizing the provinces in Iran. From the results, it is observed that the environmental factor is the key parameter for selecting biodiesel plant location. Furthermore, Golestan province was selected as the best candidate location in Iran for establishing a biodiesel plant using Jatropha plants. Using the semi-arid pastures of Golestan province (about 402,000 Hectares), 1,930,000 tons biodiesel can be produced annually for supplying the fuel to 600,000 diesel cars. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - n-octanol (C8H17OH), an advanced sustainable biofuel, can be originated from ligno-cellulosic biomass raw materials that is convenient for compression-ignition (CI) engine technology due to its plenty of fuel characterizations closer to traditional diesel fuel (DF) than more generally examined alcohol types. The existing paper deals with a comprehensive experimental study regarding the engine performance, harmful pollutants, and combustion characteristics of a single-cylinder, four-stroke, water-cooled, and direct-injection CI engine operating with n-octanol / DF blends of 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% (by volume) into pure DF, respectively. In case of the steady-state situations, the engine tests were carried out under a stable engine speed of 1500 rpm and four distinct engine loading conditions (25%, 50%, 75%, and full load). The experimental outcomes displayed that NO and CO emissions remarkably descended down to 25.08% and 11.67%, respectively along with an ascending proportion of the n-octanol in the n-octanol / DF blends. On the other hand, CO2 emission that is an indicator of the complete combustion moderately got larger up to 8.57% with the infusion higher-order alcohol into the DF. According to the performance indicators of the researched engine, the highest BTE and the lowest BSFC were observed with using DF because of the higher energy content with respect to the other tested fuel samples. Contrastingly, the duration in the ignition delay (ID) of n-octanol/DF blends was lengthy than that of mineral DF attributable to the lower cetane number of the n-octanol. In addition, the highest gas pressure inside the cylinder and the highest HRR of n-octanol including test fuels was monitored to be higher when compared with the DF by reason of the extended ID period and excessive amount of oxygen atoms available in the n-octanol. Accordingly, the combustion behaviours of n-octanol / DF blends nearly followed that of traditional DF. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fuel cell vehicles (FCV) have been proclaimed as a zero-tailpipe emissions alternative for passenger transportation; however, their overall environmental performance must be evaluated on a per-case basis. Although the environmental impacts (EI) of FCV have been already described in the literature, there is no evidence of comprehensive life cycle assessment studies analyzing the Brazilian case and its unique features, such as, the availability of biogenic feedstocks for hydrogen production via steam reform, high share of renewables in the electricity mix and the a novel powertrain technology based on solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFC) which could run on bioethanol. The purpose of this study was to quantify the EIs of polymer-electrolyte fuel cell (PEMFC) vehicles when hydrogen is produced in Brazilian conditions for a current and a 2030 scenario. Additionally, we intended to quantify the EIs of a prospective SOFC vehicle. Considering the significant burden of hydrogen production, we further aimed to explore several pathways and feedstocks for production. We found that SOFC vehicles could become a competitive alternative for impact mitigation in 2030. Most significant impact reductions are not likely to arise from fuel cell weight reduction as its burden is low compared to other car components or fuel production. As for today, PEMFC vehicles would not be competitive for any evaluated impact category. In fact, for global warming potential (GWP), they perform as bad as gasoline-fueled conventional vehicles. Assuming a centralized hydrogen production scheme, the distribution infrastructure was not a large contributor on a per-km basis. Nevertheless, building an entire hydrogen production and distribution infrastructure could be avoided under the SOFC powertrain technology. The environmental modelling of the SOFC was bound to uncertainties due to the lack of data. For GWP, the current ICEV ethanol car is competitive even for 2030 technologies, assuming the land does not come from deforestation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - At an atmospheric pressure, the effects of different temperatures and acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) content on the evaporation characteristics of biodiesel-ABE blended droplets suspended on a thermocouple fiber were investigated. The experimental results showed that micro-explosion did not occur for B80A20 (BX1AX2 represented that the volume fractions of biodiesel and ABE were X1% and X2%, respectively) blended droplets at 530 and 730 °C. The micro-explosion intensity increased first and then decreased，and reached the maximum at B40A60. Besides, it increased with temperature at certain ABE content. The fluctuation delay decreased first and then increased with ABE content, and the minimum was obtained at B60A40. In addition, it decreased with the temperature. The variation trend of micro-explosion delay was similar to that of fluctuation delay. The equivalent evaporation rate in the transient heating stage (k1) increased with the increase of ABE content, but decreased with the increase of temperature. Among all the blended droplets, the B40A60 droplets had the shortest lifetime. It can be speculated that there is an optimal ABE content between 40% and 60%, which makes the biodiesel-ABE blended droplets have the best evaporation performance. That is, the blended droplets have stronger micro-explosion and ejection, shorter fluctuation delay time and lifetime. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The Brazilian government’s decision to open the Amazon biome to sugarcane expansion reignited EU concerns regarding the sustainability of Brazil’s sugar sector, hindering the ratification of the EU-Mercosur trade agreement. Meanwhile, in the EU, certain conventional biofuels face stricter controls, whilst uncertainty surrounding the commercialisation of more sustainable advanced-biofuels renders bioethanol as a short- to medium-term fix. This paper examines Brazil’s land-use changes and associated greenhouse gas emissions arising from an EU driven ethanol import policy and projections for other 13 biocommodities. Results suggest that Brazil’s sugarcane could satisfy growing ethanol demand and comply with EU environmental criteria, since almost all sugarcane expansion is expected to occur on long-established pasturelands in the South and Midwest. However, expansion of sugarcane is also driven by competition for viable lands with other relevant commodities, mainly soy and beef. As a result, deforestation trends in the Amazon and Cerrado biomes linked to soy and beef production could jeopardize Brazil’s contribution to the Paris agreement with an additional 1 ± 0.3 billion CO2eq tonnes above its First NDC target by 2030. Trade talks with a narrow focus on a single commodity could thus risk unsustainable outcomes, calling for systemic sustainability benchmarks, should the deal be ratified. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Pyrene (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon), an anthropogenic organic pollutant prevalent in various ecological units, receives more attention for bioremediation and energy transformation using microalgae. In this study, we have used pyrene pollutant (50–500 ppm) to evaluate the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of Chlorella sorokiniana and the impact on metabolites as well as the induction of lipid biosynthesis to produce renewable biodiesel. Pyrene concentration at 230 ppm (IC50) caused half-maximum inhibition for the 96 h incubation. The harvest in the stationary stage (day 16) for C. sorokiniana revealed a biomass generation of 449 ± 7 mg L−1 and 444 ± 8 mg L−1 dcw in the control medium and pyrene IC50 medium, respectively. An insignificant decline in biomass generation (1.2%) was observed due to the stress effect of the pyrene IC50 medium on metabolic biosynthesis. Although contrary to biomass generation, IC50 of pyrene assisted to induce lipid biosynthesis in C. sorokiniana. The improvement in lipid biosynthesis was observed as ~24% higher in pyrene IC50 compared to the control medium. The chemical composition of the microalgae biomass, metabolites, and lipids was examined using FTIR spectra. The extracted lipid was transesterified to produce biodiesel via methanolic-H2SO4 catalysis. The renewable biodiesel obtained was evaluated using FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The transformation efficiency of the lipid of C. sorokiniana in biodiesel was calculated as ~81%. This research offers the incentive in lipid biosynthesis in microalgae cells using pyrene for the production of renewable and sustainable ecological biofuels along with bioremediation of pyrene. © 2021

AB  - Background: Production of biodiesel from renewable sources such as inedible vegetable oils by enzymatic catalysis has been a hotspot but remains a challenge on the efficient use of an enzyme. COFs (Covalent Organic Frameworks) with large surface area and porosity can be applied as ideal support to avoid aggregation of lipase and methanol. However, the naturally low density limits its application. In this work, we reported a facile synthesis of core–shell magnetic COF composite (Fe3O4@COF-OMe) to immobilize RML (Rhizomucor miehei lipase), to achieve its utilization in biodiesel production. Result: This strategy gives extrinsic magnetic property, and the magnetic COFs is much heavier and could disperse in water medium well, facilitating the attachment with the enzyme. The resultant biocomposite exhibited an excellent capacity of RML due to its high surface area and fast response to the external magnetic field, as well as good chemical stability. The core–shell magnetic COF-OMe structure not only achieved highly efficient immobilization and recovery processes but also maintained the activity of lipase to a great extent. RML@Fe3O4@COF-OMe performed well in practical applications, while free lipase did not. The biocomposite successfully achieved the production of biodiesel from Jatropha curcas Oil with a yield of about 70% in the optimized conditions. Conclusion: Magnetic COFs (Fe3O4@COF-OMe) for RML immobilization greatly improved catalytic performance in template reaction and biodiesel preparation. The magneticity makes it easily recovered and separated from the system. This first successful attempt of COFs-based immobilized enzyme broadened the prospect of biodiesel production by COFs with some inspiration. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Production of biofuels and green chemicals by microbes is currently of great interest due to the increasingly limited reserves of fossil fuels. Biodiesel, especially fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), is considered as an attractive alternative because of its similarity with petrodiesel and compatibility with existing infrastructures. Cost-efficient bio-production of FAEEs requires a highly lipogenic production host that is suitable for large-scale fermentation. As a non-model oleaginous yeast that can be cultured to an extremely high cell density and accumulate over 70% cell mass as lipids, Rhodotorula toruloides represents an attractive host for FAEEs production. Results: We first constructed the FAEE biosynthetic pathways in R. toruloides by introducing various wax ester synthase genes from different sources, and the bifunctional wax ester synthase/acyl-CoA-diacyglycerol acyltransferase (WS/DGAT) gene from Acinetobacter baylyi was successfully expressed, leading to a production of 826 mg/L FAEEs through shake-flask cultivation. We then mutated this bifunctional enzyme to abolish the DGAT activity, and further improved the titer to 1.02 g/L. Finally, to elevate the performance of Δku70-AbWS* in a bioreactor, both batch and fed-batch cultivation strategies were performed. The FAEEs titer, productivity and yield were 4.03 g/L, 69.5 mg/L/h and 57.9 mg/g (mg FAEEs/g glucose) under batch cultivation, and 9.97 g/L, 90.6 mg/L/h, and 86.1 mg/g under fed-batch cultivation. It is worth mentioning that most of the produced FAEEs were secreted out of the cell, which should greatly reduce the cost of downstream processing. Conclusion: We achieved the highest FAEEs production in yeast with a final titer of 9.97 g/L and demonstrated that the engineered R. toruloides has the potential to serve as a platform strain for efficient production of fatty acid-derived molecules. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Rhodosporidium strain, a well-known oleaginous yeast, has been widely used as a platform for lipid and carotenoid production. However, the production of squalene for application in lipid-based biofuels is not reported in this strain. Here, a new strain of Rhodosporidium sp. was isolated and identified, and its potential was investigated for production of squalene under various cultivation conditions. Results: In the present study, Rhodosporidium sp. DR37 was isolated from mangrove ecosystem and its potential for squalene production was assessed. When Rhodosporidium sp. DR37 was cultivated on modified YEPD medium (20 g/L glucose, 5 g/L peptone, 5 g/L YE, seawater (50% v/v), pH 7, 30 °C), 64 mg/L of squalene was produced. Also, squalene content was obtained as 13.9% of total lipid. Significantly, use of optimized medium (20 g/L sucrose, 5 g/L peptone, seawater (20% v/v), pH 7, 25 °C) allowed highest squalene accumulation (619 mg/L) and content (21.6% of total lipid) in Rhodosporidium sp. DR37. Moreover, kinetic parameters including maximum specific cell growth rate (μmax, h−1), specific lipid accumulation rate (qp, h−1), specific squalene accumulation rate (qsq, h−1) and specific sucrose consumption rate (qs, h−1) were determined in optimized medium as 0.092, 0.226, 0.036 and 0.010, respectively. Conclusions: This study is the first report to employ marine oleaginous Rhodosporidium sp. DR37 for accumulation of squalene in optimized medium. These findings provide the potential of Rhodosporidium sp. DR37 for production of squalene as well as lipid and carotenoids for biofuel applications in large scale.

AB  - Agricultural direct energy use is responsible for about 1-2% of global emissions and is the major emitting sector for methane (2.9 GtCO2eq y-1) and nitrous oxide (2.3 GtCO2eq y-1). In the last century, farm mechanisation has brought higher productivity levels and lower land demands at the expense of an increase in fossil energy and agrochemicals use. The expected increase in certain food and bioenergy crops and the uncertain mitigation options available for non-CO2 emissions make of vital importance the assessment of the use of energy and the related emissions attributable to this sector. The aim of this paper is to present a simulation framework able to forecast energy demand, technological diffusion, required investment and land use change of specific agricultural crops. MUSE-Ag & LU, a novel energy systems-oriented agricultural and land use model, has been used for this purpose. As case study, four main crops (maize, soybean, wheat and rice) have been modelled in mainland China. Besides conventional direct energy use, the model considers inputs such as fertiliser and labour demand. Outputs suggest that the modernisation of agricultural processes in China could have the capacity to reduce by 2050 on-farm emissions intensity from 0.024 to 0.016 GtCO2eq PJcrop-1 (-35.6%), requiring a necessary total investment of approximately 319.4 billion 2017$US. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Residues from the wine industry constitute an abundant feedstock for biodiesel production in wine-producing countries. The use of grapeseed oil, together with bioethanol obtained from distillation of wine surplus or grape skins and stalks and wine lees, as reagents in the transesterification reaction, results in a mixture of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE), which is a fully renewable, autochthonous, and waste-derived biofuel. In this work, a blend of FAEE produced from grape seed oil with diesel fuel was selected based on a study of fuel properties, and the optimal blend, with 30% v/v of FAEE, was tested in a Euro 6 engine following the Worldwide harmonized Light-duty Test Cycle (WLTC) and a Real Driving Emissions Cycle (RDE), as required in the new certification procedures. Engine performance and emissions from this blend and a commercial diesel fuel were compared. The FAEE blend showed a significant potential to reduce particle emissions, both in mass and number (from 23% in number to 46.5% in mass for WLTC, and from 56% in number to 61% in mass for RDE), and CO (25.5% for WLTC and 39% for RDE) but penalized NOx (32% higher in WLTC and 26.4% higher in RDE). © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Heterotrophic single-cell oils (SCOs) are one potential replacement to lipid-derived biofuels sourced from first-generation crops such as palm oil. However, despite a large experimental research effort in this area, there are only a handful of techno-economic modelling publications. As such, there is little understanding of whether SCOs are, or could ever be, a potential competitive replacement. To help address this question, we designed a detailed model that coupled a hypothetical heterotroph (using the very best possible biological lipid production) with the largest and most efficient chemical plant design possible. Results: Our base case gave a lipid selling price of $1.81/kg for ~ 8,000 tonnes/year production, that could be reduced to $1.20/kg on increasing production to ~ 48,000 tonnes of lipid a year. A range of scenarios to further reduce this cost were then assessed, including using a thermotolerant strain (reducing the cost from $1.20 to $1.15/kg), zero-cost electricity ($ 1.12/kg), using non-sterile conditions ($1.19/kg), wet extraction of lipids ($1.16/kg), continuous production of extracellular lipid ($0.99/kg) and selling the whole yeast cell, including recovering value for the protein and carbohydrate ($0.81/kg). If co-products were produced alongside the lipid then the price could be effectively reduced to $0, depending on the amount of carbon funnelled away from lipid production, as long as the co-product could be sold in excess of $1/kg. Conclusions: The model presented here represents an ideal case that which while not achievable in reality, importantly would not be able to be improved on, irrespective of the scientific advances in this area. From the scenarios explored, it is possible to produce lower cost SCOs, but research must start to be applied in three key areas, firstly designing products where the whole cell is used. Secondly, further work on the product systems that produce lipids extracellularly in a continuous processing methodology or finally that create an effective biorefinery designed to produce a low molecular weight, bulk chemical, alongside the lipid. All other research areas will only ever give incremental gains rather than leading towards an economically competitive, sustainable, microbial oil. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Butanol (n-butanol) has been gaining attention as a renewable energy carrier and an alternative biofuel with superior properties to the most widely used ethanol. We performed 48 anaerobic fermentations simultaneously with glucose and xylose as representative lignocellulosic sugars by Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 in BioLector® microbioreactors to understand the effect of different sugar mixtures on fermentation and to demonstrate the applicability of the micro-cultivation system for high-throughput anaerobic cultivation studies. We then compared the results to those of similar cultures in serum flasks to provide insight into different setups and measurement methods. Results: ANOVA results showed that the glucose-to-xylose ratio affects both growth and production due to Carbon Catabolite Repression. The study demonstrated successful use of BioLector® system for the first time for screening several media and sugar compositions under anaerobic conditions by using online monitoring of cell mass and pH in real-time and at unprecedented time-resolution. Fermentation products possibly interfered with dissolved oxygen (DO) measurements, which require a careful interpretation of DO monitoring results. Conclusions: The statistical approach to evaluate the microbioreactor setup, and information obtained in this study will support further research in bioreactor and bioprocess design, which are very important aspects of industrial fermentations of lignocellulosic biomass. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The use of biowaste feedstock is often suggested for sustainable production of synthetic fuels through gasification followed by the Fischer-Tropsch process. While the technical performance of this type of bioenergy system has significantly been investigated, comprehensive sustainability analyses are still required. The present study evaluates the life cycle sustainability performance of synthetic diesel and gasoline from Tunisian date palm waste, and compares it with that of conventional fossil fuels. Life cycle inventories are elaborated to subsequently characterise the performance of the synthetic biofuels under a set of 12 environmental, economic and social indicators. Both environmental and economic hotspots were found to be associated with the need for electricity and oxygen. Direct emissions to the air and the investment in the plant's power section were also found to significantly affect the environmental and economic performances, respectively. Potential social impacts were found to be mainly linked to the supply chain of equipment and infrastructure, while electricity arose as the most contributing operational element. Overall, the evaluated synthetic biofuels could be considered competitive with conventional fossil fuels and contribute to the achievement of sustainable development goals only if environmentally- and socially-friendly (renewable) electricity and oxygen sources are implemented and the scale and configuration of the plant are optimised. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Surface coking is the primary deactivation pattern of metal-based catalyst in biofuel reforming, which hinders the commercial utilisation of biomass. In this study, molecular dynamics simulation with reactive force field is performed to investigate the surface instability induced thermal degradation of Ni nanocatalyst and coke deposition induced catalyst deactivation. Coke deposited on catalyst surfaces is a complex mixture of carbonaceous organics. Coke surrogate models containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and oxygenated aromatics are proposed to reflect the molecular size and O/C ratio based on the molecular structures identified during lignin pyrolysis and soot inception mechanism. Lindemann index is used to characterize the degree of crystallinity of catalyst. It is found that atoms at unsaturated sites of outer shell show high mobility and tend to modify the coordination number distribution. Mechanisms behind the effects of temperature, PAH size and oxygen content on coke adsorption are revealed from three aspects of molecular collision dynamics, thermal dynamics and kinetics. The modification of crystallinity of catalyst outer shell and the occurrence of seeping after coke adsorption would affect the subsequent catalyst regeneration. This study is expected to provide guidance on the design of anti-coking catalyst, evaluation of catalyst regeneration and reactor optimisation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper reports a study of the combustion dynamics of n-butyl acetate (BA) using the configuration of a burning droplet. Two grades of BA were examined: one (SBA) synthesized by a new process described in the paper that uses a metabolically engineered solventogenic Clostridium strain through an extractive fermentation process using n-hexadecane as the extractant; and one commercially available as a high-purity (99.9%) ‘neat’ BA grade produced by conventional Fischer esterification (NBA). The initial droplet diameter was primarily 0.6 mm with some limited experiments carried out for 0.4 mm droplets to show the influence of convection. Experiments were performed in the standard atmosphere and ignition was by spark discharge. The results showed the presence of impurities in the SBA at mass concentrations totaling about 6% which included n-butanol, n-hexadecane, iso-propyl alcohol and ethyl acetate. Droplet burning rates and flame structures were not influenced by these impurities at this concentration level. In the presence of convection created by buoyancy, droplets burned faster with stretched flames and a luminosity revealing the presence of soot by incandescence at the flame tips. Reducing the initial droplet diameter to 0.4 mm eliminated the convective effect and resulted in near spherical flames. The results presented show that the new synthesis process is a sustainable alternative for BA production with burning characteristics identical to NBA in both convective and stagnant gas transport fields. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The study deals with the pyrolysis of sewage sludge to produce eco-friendly and sustainable fuels along with value-added biochar products. The experiments were conducted in a fixed-bed cylindrical glass reactor in the temperature range of 250–700 °C and achieved the product yield of 22.4 wt% bio-oil, 18.9 wt % pyrolysis gases, and 58.7 wt% biochar at 500 °C optimum temperature. The chemical composition of bio-oil was investigated by gas chromatograph-mass spectroscopy and fourier transformation infrared techniques. The ASTM standard procedures were used to assess the fuel qualities of bio-oil, and they were found to be satisfactory. Bio-oil has a greater H/C ratio (3.49) and a lower O/C ratio (1.10), indicating that it is suitable for engine use. The gas chromatographic analysis of pyrolysis gases confirmed the presence of 41.16 wt % combustible gases, making it suitable for use in spark-ignition engines. X-ray fluorescence analysis of biochar showed that it had a good amount of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium along with some micro-and macro-nutrient which proves its potential to utilize as organic manure in the agriculture sector. In addition, the data obtained from the TGA analysis during the pyrolysis of sewage sludge was applied to calculate kinetic parameters via the Coats-Redfern method. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The current increase in the world population and its energy demand promotes the study and implementation of cleaner energy forms since the traditional energy recovery systems are seriously affecting the environment. Biofuels and especially biomass or solid biofuels represent a sustainable energy source for developed and developing countries. This review aims to discuss the characteristics and advantages of solid biofuels, analyse the pretreatments and thermal treatments required to recover energy, and compare them with traditional fossil fuels. Other areas such as the sustainability and economic feasibility of solid biofuels are likewise addressed by explaining frequently used tools to evaluate the environmental impact as Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Comparatively, more recent methodologies are examined as efforts for accomplishing sustainability in the biofuel industry, namely Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) and certification schemes like the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), the Inter-American Development Bank Sustainability Scorecard, and initiatives like the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). Finally, it was revealed that the economic feasibility and competitiveness of solid biofuels differ among developing countries but represent a notable contribution to their energy matrix. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is highly detrimental, and its death distribution peculiarity has severely affected people's health and the operations of businesses. COVID-19 has wholly undermined the global economy, including inflicting significant damage to the ever-emerging biomass supply chain; its sustainability is disintegrating due to the coronavirus. The biomass supply chain must be sustainable and robust enough to adapt to the evolving and fluctuating risks of the market due to the coronavirus or any potential future pandemics. However, no such study has been performed so far. To address this issue, investigating how COVID-19 influences a biomass supply chain is vital. This paper presents a dynamic risk assessment methodological framework to model biomass supply chain risks due to COVID-19. Using a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) formalism, the impacts of COVID-19 on the performance of biomass supply chain risks have been studied. The proposed model has been applied to the biomass supply chain of a U.S.-based Mahoney Environmental® company in Washington, USA. The case study results show that it would take one year to recover from the maximum damage to the biomass supply chain due to COVID-19, while full recovery would require five years. Results indicate that biomass feedstock gate availability (FGA) is 2%, due to pandemic and lockdown conditions. Due to the availability of vaccination and gradual business reopenings, this availability increases to 92% in the second year. Results also indicate that the price of fossil-based fuel will gradually increase after one year of the pandemic; however, the market prices of fossil-based fuel will not revert to pre-coronavirus conditions even after nine years. K-fold cross-validation is used to validate the DBN. Results of validation indicate a model accuracy of 95%. It is concluded that the pandemic has caused risks to the sustainability of biomass feedstock, and the current study can help develop risk mitigation strategies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The hydro-processing of palm oil in a continuous mini fixed-bed reactor to produce bio-hydrogenated diesel (BHD) was investigated to improve the production biofuel. Rh/HZSM-5 was used as catalyst to facilitate cracking, hydrogenation, and isomerization reactions. The operating parameters included reaction temperature (400–500 °C), pressure (7–34 bar), weight hourly space velocity (10.0–43.7 h−1), and hydrogen-to-oil molar ratio (36.6:1–220.9:1). The optimal conditions were at reaction temperature of 500 °C, pressure of 34 bar, 0.05 g of catalyst, WHSV of 43.7 h−1, and hydrogen-to-oil molar ratio of 36.6:1. The yield and productivity of C8-C18 were 51.13% and 21.2 kgproduct/kgcath, respectively. The catalyst stability was demonstrated for 600 min. Fuel properties including density, viscosity, cloud point, pour point, acid value, and oxidation stability of the product collected at the optimal conditions were measured and compared with the US and European standards as well as the commercially available B-20 and B100-FAME in Thailand. The extremely short residence time (&lt; 1 min) and the significant decrease in the use of hydrogen were observed along with the high-quality fuel when compared to the other processing techniques. © 2021

AB  - The oxidation stability and lubrication properties of biodiesel have been the focus of research, this study focuses on the oxidation and lubrication properties of TEPA on biodiesel and its anti-oxidation and lubrication mechanisms. The Rancimat method was used to study the oxidation resistance of TEPA. The results showed that when 3‰ of trace TEPA was added, the oxidation performance of Jatropha biodiesel was improved by 11.41 times, and the stability factor of TEPA's antioxidant activity is greater than 1 under micro conditions, and the oxidation resistance was significantly improved. The kinetic parameters and thermodynamics of the oxidation degradation process of TEPA were analyzed. The results showed that the kinetic activation energy was 86.756 kJ mol−1, the reaction order was 1, the frequency factor A is 1.235 × 1011, the thermodynamic activation entropy was −43.059 J mol−1 K−1, by the results shown, the existence of an endothermic and non-spontaneous process and the antioxidant product of TEPA was a good free radical inhibitor. The High Frequency Reciprocating Rig (HFRR) was used to study the lubricating performance of TEPA for Jatropha biodiesel at different temperatures (40 ℃–80 ℃) and different adding amount (0–2.5 wt.%). The average friction coefficient of Jatropha biodiesel with the addition of 2.5‰ TEPA decreased by 88.89 % (at 40 ℃), and the lubrication performance was greatly improved, However, the increase in temperature will have a greater impact on the lubrication improvement effect of TEPA. When the experimental temperature is, 50 ℃, 60 ℃, 70 ℃, 80 ℃, the average friction coefficient when adding 2.5‰ TEPA decreases respectively. 81.82 %, 76.92 %, 57.14 %, 52.94 %, the lubrication improving effect of Jatropha biodiesel gradually decreases. The high viscosity characteristics of TEPA and the ability to chelate metal ions in biodiesel are the main reasons for improving the lubricating performance of biodiesel. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Microbial based biofuels represent a potential promising solution as an environmentally favorable transportation fuel. Cyanobacteria have many of the same advantages as microalgae: ability for rapid growth in otherwise non-arable regions, suitability for genetic engineering, and simple nutritional needs. Additionally, cyanobacteria can be engineered to secrete valuable co-products that can be harvested independent from the produced biomass. However, little work has been done to identify the processes and the economic and environmental impacts associated with a large-scale cyanobacteria-to-fuels facility. The present study is a concurrent techno-economic and life cycle assessment of a facility that generates fuels and methyl laurate, an oleochemical, from the cyanobacterial species Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The biorefinery model includes all aspects of cultivation, separation of the secreted methyl laurate, biomass harvesting and fuel processing via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of the dewatered biomass. The assessments leverage Monte Carlo analysis (MCA) to address uncertainty and variability inherent in the most significant input parameters, replacing them with probabilistic functions. For the facility configuration producing both fuels and the oleochemical co-product, the MCA average minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) is $2.47 per decimeter (dm3) or $9.34 per gallon of gasoline equivalent (gge) with the corresponding average global warming potential determined to be 118 g CO2-eq-MJ−1. The case producing only fuels results in an MCA average MFSP of $2.01-(dm3)−1 ($7.60-gge−1) and an average environmental impact of 100 g CO2-eq-MJ−1. These results are compared to static optimistic and conservative scenario analysis estimates, illustrating the over- and under-estimation of outcomes associated with non-stochastic methods. Suggested facility improvements include increases in pond productivity of both the biomass and methyl laurate oil production, as well as improvements to carbon utilization and bio-crude yield from HTL processing. © 2021

AB  - The aim of this work is remediation of dairy wastewater (DWW) for biodiesel feedstock production using poly-microalgae cultures of four microalgae namely Chlorella minutissima (C. minutissima), Scenedesmus abundans (S. abundans), Nostoc muscorum (N. muscorum) and Spirulina sp. The poly-microalgae cultures were prepared as C. minutissima + N. muscorum (CN), C. minutissima + N. muscorum + Spirulina sp. (CNSS) and S. abundans + N. muscorum + Spirulina sp. (SNSS). Poly-microalgae culture CNSS cultivated on 70% DWW achieved 75.16, 61.37, 58.76, 84.48 and 84.58%, removals of biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and suspended solids (SS), respectively, at 12:12 h photoperiod that resulted into total biomass and lipid yield of 3.47 ± 0.07 g/L and 496.32± 0.065 mg/L. However, maximum biomass and lipid yields of 5.76 ± 0.06 and 1152.37 ± 0.065 mg/L were achieved by poly-microalgae culture CNSS cultivated on 70% DWW + 10 g/L of glucose at 18:6 h photoperiod. Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis shown presence of C14:0 (myristic acid) C16:0 (palmitic acid), C16:1 (palmitoleic acid), C18:0 (stearic acid), C18:2 (linoleic acid) and C18:3 (linolenic acid), it indicates that the lipids produced from poly-microalgae cultures are suitable for biodiesel production. Thus, poly-microalgae cultures could be more efficient than mono-microalgae cultures in the remediation of DWW and for biodiesel feedstock production. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Algae-based technologies are one of the emerging solutions to societal issues such as accessibility to clean water and carbon-neutral energy and are a contender for the circular bioeconomy. In this review, recent developments in the use of different algal species for nutrient recovery and biomass production in wastewater, challenges, and future perspectives have been addressed. The ratio and bioavailability of nutrients in wastewater are vital parameters, which significantly impact nutrient recovery efficiency and algal biomass production. However, the optimum nutrient concentration and ratio may vary depending upon the microalgal species as well as cultivation conditions. The use of indigenous algae and algae-based consortia with other microorganisms has been proved promising in improving nutrient recovery efficiency and biomass production in pilot scale operations. However, environmental and cultivation conditions also play a significant role in determining the feasibility of the process. This review further focused on the assessment of the potential benefits of algal biomass production, renewable biofuel generation, and CO2 sequestration using wastewater in different countries on the basis of available data on wastewater generation and estimated nutrient contents. It was estimated that 5–10% replacement of fossil crude requirement with algal biofuels would require ~952–1903 billion m3 of water, 10–21 billion tons of nitrogen, and 2–4 billion tons of phosphorus fertilizers. In this context, coupling wastewater treatment and algal biomass production seem to be the most sustainable option with potential global benefits of polishing wastewater through nutrients recycling and carbon dioxide sequestration. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aviation industry is moving towards increasing the use of renewable fuels to reduce its environmental impact and find alternative supply chains for aviation fuel. Analyzing the technical and economic viability of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) conversion pathways provides critical understanding and new insight toward long-term sustainability and commercialization of SAF. This study reviews the catalytic hydrothermolysis (CH) pathway for sustainable aviation fuel production and conducted a detailed techno-economic analysis to determine the economic viability of SAF production from four selected feedstocks - carinata oil, soybean oil, yellow grease, and brown grease. Economic analyses were performed for ‘nth plant’ (mature technology) to assess process costs and sensitivity on minimum selling price (MSP) of SAF. Without incentives, the MSP of SAF produced from soybean oil, carinata oil, yellow grease, and brown grease are $1.50/L, $1.32/L, $1.19/L for and $1.00/L respectively. Regardless of feedstock, the MSP is shown to be more sensitive to the yield of SAF and feedstock cost, than to capital and supplementary costs. Based on the analysis, the CH process is a promising technology to convert renewable oils to SAF, however the projected MSP requires incentives to achieve parity with petroleum jet fuel. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A palmitoleic acid-rich Scenedesmus obliquus strain SXND-02 was isolated from ammonium-containing wastewater. Biomass and lipid production were examined for this microalgal strain in photoautotrophic, heterotrophic, and mixotrophic cultivations, respectively, in order to extend its application in wastewater purification coupled with production of valued bio-products. Among the tested conditions, the microalga had better growth and higher lipid accumulation in mixotrophy. NH4Cl inhibited the microalgal growth in photoautotrophic cultivation. However, NaAc alleviated this inhibition in both heterotrophy and mixotrophy. Using 7 g L−1 NaAc and 0.5 g L−1 NH4Cl as carbon and nitrogen sources significantly increased the algal biomass and lipid yields under mixotrophic cultivation, with the highest levels up to 1.0 g L−1 and 59.88%, respectively. Fatty acid profiling indicated that palmitoleic acid was 23% in the S. obliquus SXND-02 under mixotrophic condition, which was about 21-fold higher than that in the control S. obliquus. Furthermore, this microalgal strain was tested in the chicken farm wastewater (CFW) containing high ammonium. Compared with other treatments, the S. obliquus SXND-02 cultivated in the 1/2 CFW + NaAc medium produced larger amounts of biomass (2.18 g L−1) and lipids (50.22%), and simultaneously higher removal rates of total nitrogen (TN) (80%), total ammonium nitrogen (TAN) (68%), total phosphate (TP) (82%), biological oxygen demand (BOD) (86%) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) (89%) from wastewater. The present data indicate that this excellent microalga can be used in mixotrophic cultivation for wastewater purification coupled with commercial production of valued biomass and high-quality algal oils. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper proposes a methodology to design the biomethane production chain from MSW at the regional level and to assess the environmental and economic performance of the chain. In the design phase, the following parameters are considered: number and production capacity of biomethane plants, localization of plants, waste flows among municipalities and plants. The model is adopted to design the biomethane chain in the Rome Metropolitan Area (Italy). Several structures of production chain are designed and their performances are assessed. The economic factors mostly able to affect the performance of the chain are waste disposal tariff, biomethane selling price, and the economic incentive provided to biomethane producers. Their impacts are discussed through sensitivity analyses. Results show that the structure maximizing the economic performance has the worst environmental performance and vice versa. Hence, a new structure of the economic incentive is proposed, aimed at re-aligning economic and environmental performance. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - The fossil fuel utilization adversely affected the environmental health due to the rising emission levels of greenhouse gases. Consequently, the challenges of climate change loaded great stress on renewable energy sources. It is noted that extreme consumption of fossil fuels increased the earth temperature by 1.9 °C that adversely influenced the life and biodiversity. Biorefinery is the sustainable process for the production of biofuels and other bio-products from biomass feedstock using different conversion technologies. Biofuel is an important component of renewable energy sources contributing to overall carbon-neutral energy system. Studies reported that on global scale, over 90% of petroleum goods could be produced from renewable resources by 2023, whereas, 33% chemicals, and 50% of the pharmaceutical market share is also expected to be bio-based. This study details the brief review of operation, development, application, limitations, future perspectives, circular bioeconomy, and life cycle assessment of biorefinery. The economic and environmental aspects of biofuels and biorefineries are briefly discussed. Lastly, considering the present challenges, the future perspectives of biofuels and biorefineries are highlighted. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study examines the feasibility of using fast pyrolysis bio-oil (FPBO) made from non-food woody biomass in a micro-gas turbine with a unique burner design, motivated by the recent surge in the development of renewable carbon-neutral biomass-derived liquids in energy applications. The study is comprehensive and covers FPBO production and applications, physicochemical properties and spray characteristics, and combustion performance. The effects of fuel spray formation and preparation on the combustion of FPBO, ethanol (EtOH) and diesel fuel were investigated using two twin-fluid nozzles with distinct atomization mechanisms, externally- and internally-mixed, and a premixer tube. In contrast to diesel fuel and EtOH, reaching a stable flame using 100% FPBO was impossible because of the fuel polymerization (or coking) when impinging on the high-temperature inner wall of the premixer tube. EtOH addition was, therefore, used to address the problem by improving the FPBO's volatility. The FPBO spray flame generated by the internally-mixed nozzle exhibited less gas- and solid-phase emissions than the externally-mixed one and required less EtOH addition for stabilization. While this study shows the feasibility for deployment of FPBO in the present micro-gas turbine design, injector modification or fuel upgrading are necessary prior to it being used to replace fossil oils. © 2021

AB  - Wastewater sludge from a poultry slaughterhouse treatment plant was recovered through conversion into biodiesel by ultrasound-assisted in situ transesterification. The main effects of the process parameters were investigated at three levels, and their empirical relationship was modeled using artificial neural network (ANN) and response surface methodology (RSM). The developed models predicted the process behavior with excellent accuracy. Although both models had similar prediction performances, ANN marginally outperformed RSM. The capability of the genetic algorithm (GA) combined with the RSM (RSM-GA) and ANN (ANN-GA) models was evaluated for optimizing the process variables. The maximum biodiesel yield (21.45% w/w) was obtained using the ANN-GA model under optimized conditions, i.e., at the reaction time of 39.69 min, H2SO4 concentration of 3.34% (v/v), methanol-to-sludge relative content of 14.91:1 (mL/g), and ultrasound power of 104.87 W. Consequently, a combination of ANN and GA was proposed to model and optimize the transesterification process. The biodiesel yield obtained in this study was higher than the previously reported values from tannery (10.98%), dairy (13.46%), and municipal (18.58%) sewage sludge. This study specified biodiesel with a fatty acid methyl esters content of 96.86% using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Mixture Temperature-Controlled combustion is a novel concept featuring ultra-low pollutant emission. Since the resulting distributed combustion is highly homogeneous, NOX emission can be kept below 10 ppm. The available renewable fuels worldwide vary a lot in their characteristics. Three renewable hydrocarbon fuels: coconut oil, palm oil, and waste cooking oil-rapeseed oil methyl esters were tested along with three conventional fuels: standard jet fuel (JP-8), standard diesel oil, and natural gas. The ultimate goal of the present study was the comparison of the flame structures, chemiluminescent, and pollutant emissions of various fuels, exploiting distributed combustion offered by the novel burner concept. As mixture preparation is highly sensitive to fuel vaporization, distillation curves of the five investigated liquid fuels were measured and evaluated. Density, surface tension, and viscosity were also measured to compare the estimated atomization characteristics. The tests were uniformly performed at 13.3 kW thermal power and an equivalence ratio of 0.8, varying atomizing pressure and air preheating temperature. It was found that jet fuel, diesel fuel, and coconut biodiesel bear the highest potential for distributed combustion in gas turbines, while incorrect burner setup may lead to unacceptably high emissions. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - In this study, the economic feasibility of jojoba cultivation for biodiesel production in Jordan is analyzed. The investigations are carried out for all activities and operations from jojoba farming, through oil extraction to biodiesel production and byproduct utilization. A thousand-hectare farm, in the eastern Badia of Jordan planted with 1666 jojoba trees per hectare, is selected as a case study area. Over the 20 years life of the project, an average annual seed production of 2.5 kg per tree, with oil content of 50%, is assumed. The amount of biodiesel produced is predicted at 1750.62 tons/year. The total fixed cost and annual operating cost are estimated at US$ thousand 12701.36 and US$ thousand 2352.38, respectively. The largest contributor to these values is the cost of the drip irrigation system, which forms about 45.83% of the total fixed capital cost and 25.79% of the total direct operating cost. The farm establishment cost contributes to 22.17% of the fixed cost, while the main biodiesel production plant represents only 6.0%. The biodiesel production cost is predicted at US$ 1.19/L when the glycerol is sold as a byproduct. However, when glycerol is converted into solketal, the credit of solketal reduces the biodiesel production cost to US$ 0.70/L. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Electric mobility slowly catches up trend in automotive sales but still it has not got the wide expected reception as typical liquid fueled vehicle due to the electric vehicles range. But the high energy density of liquid fuel is still unmatched for the performance of an electric battery. Decreasing Air Quality Index (AQI) from use of conventional fuels are alarming due to its impact on human health. These facts thrust the need for deeper study into alternative fuel research area and Malaysia being one of the largest producers of Palm Oil Methyl Ester (POME), motivates us to proceed into investigative analysis of POME fueled engine using a mathematical technique called Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Highest BSFC attained was 508.9 g/kWhr and 546.5 g/kWhr for diesel and POME50 at 3850 rpm and 25% load. Lowest O2 emissions were recorded at 4.1% and 4.4% for diesel and POME10 respectively at 1600 rpm and 100% load. Optimized engine operation was predicted with 41.21% POME as the best blend giving the best compromise in best performance and low emissions. © 2021

AB  - International shipping in the Arctic region is one of the key contributors to changes in the region due to the generated air emissions from marine fuels combustion, usage of forest-based biofuels as an alternative to conventional fossil fuels in marine shipping seem as an attractive alternative. However, a system analysis perspective is needed to ensure its sustainability. Life cycle assessment was used to estimate the environmental impacts of the production and use of two forest-based biofuels. These fuels, biodiesel and bioethanol, were derived from pulp and paper mills for use by marine shipping. They were compared to fossil fuels currently used by the marine shipping industry, those being Marine Gas Oil (MGO) and Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO). Future projection scenarios in 2030 and 2050 for estimating the environmental impacts of a transition from fossil fuels to biofuels in Arctic shipping were studied as well. The results indicate that a holistic view is very important for biofuel use. The production and use of forest-based bioethanol (BE) had a significantly lower impact on climate change (CC) potential, but had a higher impact on Human toxicity non-cancer effects (HTX), Human toxicity cancer effects (CE), Particulate matter (PM), Photochemical ozone formation (POF), Acidification potential (AP), Terrestrial eutrophication (TE), Freshwater Eutrophication (FE), Marine eutrophication (ME) and Freshwater Ecotoxicity (FEC). Replacing HFO with forest-based biodiesel reduced the potential AP by 55%. It also had a lower impact on the categories CC, PM, POF, TE, ME and FEC. Furthermore, a reduction in emissions generated by shipping in the Arctic and a better overall environmental performance can be achieved by using blends of MGO with BE. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of biomass results in the formation of bio-oil, aqueous phase (HTL-AP), bio-char, and gaseous products. Safer disposal of HTL-AP is difficult on an industrial scale since it comprises low molecular acid compounds. This review provides a comprehensive note on the recent articles published on the effective usage of HTL-AP for the recovery of valuable compounds. Thermo-chemical and biological processes are the preferred techniques for the recovery of biofuel, platform chemicals from HTL-AP. From this review, it was evident that the composition of HTL-AP and product recovery are the integrated pathways, which depend on each other. Substitute as reaction medium in HTL process, growth medium for algae and microbes are the most common mode of reuse and recycle of HTL-AP. Future research is needed to depict the mechanism of HTL process when HTL-AP is used as a reaction medium on an industrial scale. Need to find a solution for the hindrance in commercializing HTL process and recovery of value-added compounds from HTL-AP from lab scale to industry level. Integrated pathways on reuse and HTL-AP recycle helps in reduced environmental concerns and sustainable production of bio-products. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Coal to liquid (CTL) is a diesel alternative fuel based on Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process, which has shown promising application value. Besides, as an oxygenated biofuel with high oxygen content and volatility, n-butanol can be blended with hydrocarbon fuels to improve engine performance. This study aims to investigate the effects of CTL/n-butanol blends on the performance of the compression-ignition (CI) engine, and to reveal the influence of combustion boundary conditions such as n-butanol blending ratio, the start of injection (SOI), and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) on the combustion and emissions characteristics. The results show that blending n-butanol with CTL is beneficial to improve the fuel-gas mixture distribution in the cylinder, and the premixed combustion ratio (PCR) increases by 13.66% as the energy ratio of n-butanol increases to 30% (B30) compared with the pure CTL. CTL/n-butanol blends make particulate emission tend to be shifted towards nucleation mode and the particulate mass emission significantly reduced, especially the particulate mass of B30 reduce by 68.6%; meanwhile, the NOx emission shows an upward trend. Compared with n-butanol blended, adjusting the SOI impacts NOx emissions significantly, while its influence on the indicated thermal efficiency (ITE) and particulate emissions is relatively slight. Moreover, through the synergistic control of n-butanol addition and EGR, the trade-off relationship between NOx and particles is mitigated. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Algae-based aviation biofuel shows the potential to reduce soot emission in flight. A comparison study of soot precursor and aggregate property between algae-based biofuel and aviation kerosene RP-3 in laminar flame was conducted to investigate the reason of biofuel's less soot formation. The soot precursors were determined by the fringe lengths of soot particles. At a typical dimensionless height DH = 0.50 of both flames, the geometric mean fringe lengths of biofuel and RP-3 are measured to be 0.67 and 0.73 nm, respectively, approximating to the size of five-ringed (A5) and seven-ringed (A7) poly-aromatic hydrocarbon, respectively. An A5 growth mechanism was then added to biofuel surrogate mechanisms for soot formation simulation. Since the carbon number component of biofuel is wide and difficult for comprehensive mechanism development, two surrogate mechanisms were developed. One is based on the C8-C16 n-alkane that covers biofuel's main components, and the other one is based on biofuel's average carbon number to simplify the mechanism. Meanwhile, an A7 growth mechanism was added to a popular RP-3 mechanism. The soot formation simulation with the combination mechanisms for both fuels provides a better agreement with the measured primary particle diameter and suggests that the reason for less soot production by biofuel is its less soot precursor production that weakens soot nucleation and growth. Lastly, the soot fractal dimension of biofuel is smaller than that of RP-3, indicating that biofuel has a looser soot aggregate. © 2020 by ASME

AB  - Tetraselmis sp. strain MD-01, a microalga isolated from the Tunisian marine coast, has been studied for autotrophic lipids production with two stage process. This strategy was conducted for maximum cells production under moderated conditions (2.12 g L−1), followed by cultivation under stressed conditions to induce lipid synthesis. High irradiance (300 μmol m−2 s−1) and nitrogen depletion (S mode) showed better carotenoids accumulation and lower chlorophylls content in microalgae compared to those obtained in biomass cultivated under high irradiance (Sg mode). This two-stage strategy allowed to increase of lipid content in cells cultivated in Sg and S modes from 18% DW (stage I) to 50 and 61.5% DW (stage II), respectively, with an increase of saturated and long chain fatty acids levels. Based on fluorometry analyses, an increase of lipids in Nile-Red stained cells and a decrease of chlorophylls auto-fluorescence under stressed conditions were shown. From spectral data, the lipids: amide I ratio obtained from S mode was 2.17 and 4.45 times higher than that from Sg mode and control conditions, respectively. These results revealed the potential of Tetraselmis strain MD-01 for biodiesel production. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Due to the large size of free fatty acid molecules, they cannot diffuse into Al–Si–P Zeotype pores in the biofuel production process. Therefore, in the current work, to rectify this problem, in the synthesis of Al–Si–P zeotype by hydrothermal method, various weight percentages of the carbon casting and ultrasound waves for the uniform of the materials were used. Moreover, to enhancement the acidic strength and catalyst performance, Ceric oxide was accommodated on the Al–Si–P zeotype structure by sono-solvothermal synthesis. TPD-NH3, FESEM, HRTEM, BET-BJH, and EDX analyses were utilized for characterizing the samples developed in the present work. BET analysis has revealed that the optimized percentage of charcoal active is 4 wt %. By adding the sonication technique at the stage accommodating Ceric oxide on Al–Si–P zeotype, the conversion percentage increased from 77 to 94%. Test of the capability of modified Al–Si–P Zeotype with sonication and carbon casting to produce biofuel from waste oil delivered a conversion of 91.5%. Kinetic studies have shown that reaction of oil to biofuel is of the first degree, and the modified Al–Si–P Zeotype with sonication and carbon casting has the highest rate constant (0.0014 min−1) among all of the synthesized samples. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - There is an increasing demand of energy because of an increase in the number of vehicles with internal combustion engines, because of which industrial and automotive fields are concerned about fossil fuel depletion, environmental issues, and energy conservation. These challenges force the world to explore other alternative sources of energy. The extensive use of biodiesel as compression ignition engine fuel has further compelled the researchers to regulate the emission and improve the engine performance. Fuel spray behavior affects mixture formation, and this affects engine combustion and performance. This research work involves the evaluation of the relationship between spray parameters of used Jatropha curcas biodiesel fuel, including spray penetration, cone angle, and preheating temperature, compared with diesel fuel, conducted at ambient condition. In addition to this, the high-speed spray pattern photography is undertaken by using single-hole and multi-hole injectors. The spray behavior is analyzed through spray parameters such as spray cone angle and spray penetration for all test fuels. The fuel temperature has a strong relationship with spray behavior at high temperatures; as the fuel temperature increases, the spray tip penetration decreases due to the evaporation of the fuel having a low boiling point and good fuel atomization, which leads to smaller droplets and an increase in spray cone angle with the increase in temperature.

AB  - Recycling is the need of time and tyre pyrolysis is a process of recycling waste tyre to yield oil. A lot of research has been conducted on blending of diesel to produce oil but due to higher sulphur content and higher exhaust emission limits, use of tyre pyrolysis oil can be very beneficial. In the present study, our focus is on hybrid blends of oil generated, karanja biodiesel and diesel. One of the major problems with biofuel is the lower calorific value, but pyrolysis oil has higher calorific value. Hence the decision was made to blend karanja biodiesel and pyrolysis oil. The blends prepared are tyre pyrolysis (TP) 10%, karanja biodiesel (KB) 20% and diesel 70% called as TP10KB20. Similarly, TP20KB10 was also done. Further, equivalent blends of individual fuel source (TPO30 and KB30) are done and compared. Experimental investigation of hybrid blends (TP10KB20, TP20KB10) and equivalent source blend (TPO30, KBD30 and diesel) fuel are done on single cylinder CI engine. It was observed that performance and combustion of TP10KB20 and TP20KB10 were superior than any other individual blend and diesel. However, emission of TP20KB10 limits it use. Further, TP10KB20 has given superior performance, combustion and emissions characteristics compared to diesel and other blends. © 2021

AB  - The present study investigates synthesis of liquid fuels and higher hydrocarbons via Fischer Tropsch (FT) reaction using combustion synthesis (CS) catalysts. The CS method employed citric acid (C6H8O7) as fuel with lean stoichiometry (ϕ = 0.3, ϕ = 0.6) for the catalyst synthesis. CS reactions at lean conditions can be easily controlled, and holds the structural integrity of the catalyst support, resulting in no loss of active sites. The fuel-lean conditions show decreased formation of cobalt aluminates, resulting in high catalyst reducibility and larger fraction of active sites. When tested at constant space velocity, the CS catalysts achieve CO conversion up to 88%, which is 57% higher than the wet impregnation (WI) synthesized catalysts. Furthermore, the variation of the equivalence ratio allows to tailor the catalyst properties and thereby control conversion and selectivity of the CS catalysts. CS(ϕ = 0.6) showed a C5+ selectivity 31% higher compared to the CS(ϕ = 0.3). The liquid fuel space time yield (STY) ranged from 0.13 to 0.30 (gC5+ gcat-1 h-1) and it increases in the following order: WI &lt; CS(ϕ = 0.3) &lt; CS(ϕ = 0.6). These results emphasize the effectiveness of the CS method for the synthesis of FT catalysts and show the effect of the lean-fuel stoichiometry on the catalyst properties and performance. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study reports mild temperature hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of vanillin an oxygenated phenolic compound found in bio-oil to creosol. It investigates the sensitivity of vanillin HDO reaction to changes in solvent, catalyst support and active metal type, and processing parameters using 100 ml batch reactor. The processing parameters considered include temperature (318 K – 338 K), hydrogen gas pressure (1 MPa – 3 MPa), catalyst loading (0.1 kg/m3 – 0.5 kg/m3), and agitation speed (500 rpm–900 rpm). As expected, significant variation in conversion and product selectivity was displayed in the results. Among the solvents considered, 2-propanol and ethyl acetate produced the best performance with conversion close to 100 % and selectivity toward creosol above 90 %. Remarkable differences were found in the H2 uptake during VL HDO reaction under different catalyst. The hierarchy in H2 uptake of the catalysts include: Pd/C &gt; PdRh/Al2O3 &gt; Pd/Al2O3 = Pt/C &gt; Pt/SiO2 &gt;&gt; Rh/Al2O3. This was correlated to catalytic performance; Pd/C emerged as the best among the monometallic catalysts with 71 % selectivity toward creosol, but consumed 9 mmol of hydrogen per mol of vanillin converted. While the prepared bimetallic PdRh/Al2O3 catalyst consumed slightly lower amount of hydrogen (8 mmol), and produced significantly higher selectivity toward creosol (99 %). Even after three cycles the prepared catalyst demonstrated superior performance over the monometallic catalysts with selectivity toward creosol above 80 %. The reaction condition that maximises the degree of deoxygenation to creosol derived via Taguchi analysis includes temperature 338 K, hydrogen gas partial pressure 3.0 MPa, catalyst loading 0.5 kg/m3, and agitation speed 500 rpm. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A diesel engine running on diesel/biodiesel mixtures containing ethylene glycol diacetate (EGDA) was investigated from the exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental viewpoints. Biodiesel was mixed with petrodiesel at 5% and 20% volume ratios, and the resultant mixtures were then doped with EGDA at 1–3% volume ratios. The exergetic sustainability indicators of the engine operating on the prepared fuel formulations were determined at varying engine loads. The indicators were selected to support decision-making on fuel composition and engine load following thermodynamic, economic, and environmental considerations. The engine load markedly affected all the studied exergetic parameters. The highest engine exergetic efficiency (39.5%) was obtained for petrodiesel doped with 1 v/v% EGDA at the engine load of 50%. The minimum value of the unit cost of brake power exergy (49.6 US$/GJ) was found for straight petrodiesel at full-load conditions, while the minimum value of the unit environmental impact of brake power exergy (29.9 mPts/GJ) was observed for petrodiesel mixed with 5 v/v% biodiesel at the engine load of 75%. Overall, adding EGDA to fuel mixtures did not favorably influence the outcomes of both exergetic methods due to its energy-intensive and cost-prohibitive production process. In conclusion, although petrodiesel fuel improvers such EGDA used in the present study could properly mitigate pollutant emissions, the adverse effects of such additives on thermodynamic parameters of diesel engines, particularly on exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental indices, need to be taken into account, and necessary optimizations should be made before their real-world application. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Biodiesel is promoted as a sustainable replacement for commercial diesel. Biodiesel fuel and exhaust properties change depending on the base feedstock oil/fat used during creation. The aims of this study were, for the first time, to compare the exhaust exposure health impacts of a wide range of biodiesels made from different feedstocks and relate these effects with the corresponding exhaust characteristics. Method: Primary airway epithelial cells were exposed to diluted exhaust from an engine running on conventional diesel and biodiesel made from Soy, Canola, Waste Cooking Oil, Tallow, Palm and Cottonseed. Exhaust properties and cellular viability and mediator release were analysed post exposure. Results: The exhaust physico-chemistry of Tallow biodiesel was the most different to diesel as well as the most toxic, with exposure resulting in significantly decreased cellular viability (95.8 ± 6.5%) and increased release of several immune mediators including IL-6 (+223.11 ± 368.83 pg/mL) and IL-8 (+1516.17 ± 2908.79 pg/mL) above Air controls. In contrast Canola biodiesel was the least toxic with exposure only increasing TNF-α (4.91 ± 8.61). Conclusion: This study, which investigated the toxic effects for the largest range of biodiesels, shows that exposure to different exhausts results in a spectrum of toxic effects in vitro when combusted under identical conditions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Montmorillonite clay was chemically modified by grafting of 3-mercaptopropyl trimethoxy silane on the clay surface, followed by sulfonation of the terminal thiol groups. The chemical structures and surface characteristics of the prepared catalysts were characterized by FTIR, XRD, TPD, and BET analysis. The catalytic pyrolysis of Jatropha curcas oil and waste cooking oil for the production of biofuels was stimulated using the prepared catalyst. The conversion of oils into biofuels was performed at 350 °C using different catalysts amounts (0.2–1%). The obtained biofuels were characterized using density, flash, pour, and cloud points, water, sulfur, and ash contents, in addition to kinematic viscosity, copper strip, and carbon residue. Furthermore, the obtained biofuels were fractionated at 250 °C to obtain the light hydrocarbon components, which were evaluated as biojet fuel. The physical and fuel properties of biodiesel-petroleum diesel blends (B10), and biojet-JET A-1 blends were following the ASTM and IP specifications. The most suitable catalyst ratio during the catalytic cracking process was monitored at 0.8%. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Microalgae offer unique potentials for developing advanced biorefineries, including third-generation biofuel production, wastewater treatment, and animal and aquaculture feed production. The thermodegradation of protein, lipid, and carbohydrates plays a vital role in the thermochemical conversion of microalgae for biofuel production. This work aims to investigate the kinetics and the interaction of extracted protein and lipid as well as model carbohydrates from microalgae to assist the development of microalgae conversion techniques, which have not been studied so far. Thermogravimetric analysis is integrated with an independent parallel reaction (IPR) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) method to explore the pyrolysis kinetics of three constituents (protein, lipid, and carbohydrates). The calorific values of the three constituents show that protein (5.33 MJ·kg−1) is not a suitable biofuel feedstock. In contrast, lipid (34.22 MJ·kg−1) and carbohydrates (15.37–15.84 MJ·kg−1) are considered as potential feedstocks for liquid and solid biofuel production, respectively. The pyrolysis processes suggest that the thermodegradation extent follows the order of carbohydrates &gt; protein &gt; lipid. The application of the IPR-PSO method on the pyrolysis kinetics of microalgae in three pseudo-components obtains a high fit quality (&gt;96%) for all cases, indicating that the method is suitable to predict the kinetics parameters of the three constituents of microalgae. The effect analysis reveals that the synergistic effect accounts for about 50% of the total mass of the thermodegradation process of model carbohydrates, occuring at 200–320 °C. Meanwhile, the theoretical and experimental thermogravimetric analysis curve of combination of the three constituents suggests that there are four regions detected, including strong synergistic effect, weak antagonistic effect, weak synergistic effect, and strong antagonistic effect, respectively. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study performed a holistic assessment of a novel cracking alternative (olefin metathesis or OMT) that converts plant oil to aviation biofuel using lipids from Camelina sativa L. (camelina). A high-resolution spatially explicit life cycle assessment and technoeconomic analysis (HR + LCA + TEA) was employed to elucidate camelina's sustainability case. The potential camelina land was determined via the wheat-fallow Integrated Rotational Cycle (IRC) at county level for the 48 lower states in the U.S. Results revealed these lands were aggregated on the top wheat producing states of Montana, Kansas, and North Dakota at 19.5 × 106 ha, 18.2 × 106 ha, and 19.2 × 106 ha, for 2009, 2012, and 2015, respectively. If the high producing wheat lands (counties with &gt;60,000–80,000 ha) in those states were grown with camelina at U.S. average yield of 1.2 Mg/ha, around 6.35 million m3 (1.68 billion gal) of advanced biofuel will be produced, equivalent to 11.18 % of the expanded Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2) volume mandate for advanced biofuel (15 billion gal). LCA results using 1 MJ functional unit and “well-to-air” (WTA) system boundary showed that the operations cumulative energy demand (CED) for the OMT case producing simultaneous biojet, avgas, and diesel was 0.75 MJ/MJ, lower than for hydroprocessed renewable jet (HRJ) fuel (0.77 MJ/MJ) but 6.8 times higher than for petroleum jet (PTJ) fuel (0.11 MJ/MJ). The entire OMT energy demand was offset by the bioelectricity produced (0.57 MJ/MJ) from burning the meal. OMT's net GHG reduction relative to PTJ was 23.34 % but increasing camelina yield from 1.2 to 1.8 Mg/ha increased reduction to 75.71 %. TEA results adapting 100,000 m3/yr biofuel throughput showed that OMT and HRJ had profits of $21.94 M and $24.13 M, respectively, using mass product allocation. The limiting metric for OMT and HRJ was net present value (NPV), and the minimum camelina yield to ensure profit was 1.18 Mg/ha. OMT can achieve maximum profit by selling biojet fuel at a price not lower than $2.75/gal and selling camelina meal feed pellets at a minimum price of $330/Mg. No tax incentive was needed for biojet and avgas because even at their base median values (biojet = $2.19/gal, avgas = $2.59/gal), NPV is still positive. © 2021

AB  - Rapid industrialization and population growth have resulted in the wastage of significant quantity of food globally throughout the value chain right from harvesting to storage, processing and consumption. Normally, these waste materials are allowed to decay in the natural process or burnt to recover a part of the energy in the thermal form, leading to environmental pollution and loss of value. There is an imperative need to realize that food waste is a bundle of energy, which requires carefully planned recovery without damaging the environment. Conversion of food waste to bio-based liquid or gaseous fuels appears to be an attractive option to meet the escalating demand for fuel and at the same time slowing down the fast-depleting fossil fuel resources. In this context, it is felt appropriate to review the current status of the available technologies which are used in the disposal of food waste in order to identify the variables for process intensification to convert them to fuel keeping in mind the environmental concerns and logistics of utilization. The technologies including incineration, landfill, composting, anaerobic digestion, pyrolysis and biochemical methods have been assessed alongside the recent developing technologies such as hydrothermal carbonization and supercritical water gasification. The critical evaluations of these technologies have been made based on the concepts of life cycle analysis, multi-objective optimization and circular bio-economics which help in assessing the environmental impact. Finally, safety aspects and the way forward are highlighted for future work. This article could form a promising path towards a holistic assessment of efficient food waste to energy conversion for a sustainable development. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An experimental study was performed on a single-cylinder high-speed direct-injection diesel research engine to determine the effects of increasing biodiesel content on the combustion characteristics and HC emissions during high-EGR low temperature combustion operation. Two test points, a moderately dilute low-load condition and a high-EGR medium-load condition, were examined at a constant speed of 1500 rpm with a fixed input fuel energy content and start of injection timing. The results show the two operating conditions to have very different sensitivities to the fuel's biodiesel content and, as a result, to demonstrate contrasting behaviour with respect to the variation of HC emissions with blend composition. For the low load, medium dilution case, ignition delay, combustion phasing and combustion duration are essentially independent of biofuel content while HC emissions are reduced with respect to the base diesel. For the high-EGR, medium load condition, ignition delay is reduced and combustion phasing advances with increasing levels of biofuel content. HC emissions increase with increasing biofuel content. Crank-angle aligned HC measurements indicate the significance of the piston/wall crevice volume as an HC source in high-EGR LTC. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The usage of i-propanol-n-butanol-ethanol (IBE) in engines as substitute resources can significantly reduce the regeneration and separation expenses in the manufacturing of n-butanol and avert the corrosion tendency of acetone in acetone-n-butanol-ethanol (ABE) proposed as the next generation biofuel of n-butanol. To predict the combustion and emission characteristics of IBE mixture and n-butanol in diesel engine, a synthetical skeletal mechanism including 152 species and 775 reactions was proposed in this study based on sub-mechanisms reduction, reduced sub-mechanisms coupling, and coupled sub-mechanisms optimization. After a preliminary evaluation using the uncertainty analysis based on polynomial chaos expansions, the mechanism was widely validated against ignition delay, laminar flame speed and premixed flame species profile. It provides a satisfactory prediction for the combustion characteristics of IBE, i-propanol, n-butanol, ethanol and diesel surrogates. A CFD model coupled with the mechanism was then developed to further verify the efficiency of the mechanism in engine combustion simulation. The findings portray that engine combustion and emissions characteristics were reliably reproduced. From the comparison study on IBE and n-butanol combustion in a diesel engine which is rarely reported, it is seen that the diesel blended with 15 vol% or 30 vol% IBE and n-butanol results in the prolonged ignition delay, shortened combustion duration, suppressed soot emissions, and deteriorated NOx emissions. The IBE-diesel blends have a shorter combustion duration, lower soot emissions and higher NOx emissions compared to n-butanol-diesel blends at the same blend ratio. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work reports the experimental study of a single-cylinder compression ignition engine fueled with a renewable diesel from sugarcane called farnesane. The engine is representative of current small-scale power generation in very isolated rural areas existing in Brazil. A complete experimental assessment was made on engine combustion, performance, and pollutant emissions at 1800 rpm under different loads (from 4 to 7 bar IMEP). Results showed reduced values for the ignition delay, in-cylinder peak pressure and mean temperature when using farnesane compared to conventional diesel fuel, as well as lower heat release rate peaks at the premixed combustion phase and shorter diffusion combustion duration. Physicochemical properties differences, such as cetane number, H/C ratio and the biofuel paraffinic structure led to interesting emission behavior. Farnesane reduced NOx emissions by up to 34% (and further 48.6% using EGR), and particulate matter by up to 92%. Despite the higher in-cylinder peak pressure and greater fuel conversion efficiency for diesel fuel at the highest load, the biofuel exhibited gains of up to 3.3% in combustion efficiency and 5.9% in fuel conversion efficiency at intermediate and lower loads. Such improvements are closely related to the HC and CO levels depletion and the absence of aromatic compounds. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study examines the burning characteristics and disruptive burning phenomena of single droplets of aluminum nanoparticles (n-Al) stably suspended in a biofuel (HVO). The biofuel used in the present work is a promising alternative fuel already tested in the aviation sector to reduce greenhouse gas and pollutant emissions. Experiments were conducted with two particle sizes (40nm and 70nm) and two particle concentrations (0.5 wt.% and 1.0 wt.%) to study its influence when added to the biofuel. The effect of size and concentration of the aluminum nanoparticles was studied at 1100 °C in a drop tube furnace. This experimental facility allows the study of combustion characteristics of falling droplets, ensuring there is no influence of the supporting fiber on the burning rate and disruptive burning phenomena occurrence. A CMOS high - speed camera coupled with a high magnification lens was used to evaluate the droplet size, burning rate, and micro-explosions. Based on this procedure, pure biofuel droplets were compared with those of biofuel blended with nanoparticles. The results suggest that the combustion characteristics of pure HVO can be enhanced with the addition of aluminum nanoparticles. Furthermore, by decreasing the particle size, a slight increase in the burning rate of nanofuels was noticed. Additionally, an increase in the particle concentration leads to a pronounced increase in the burning rate. The particle concentration also influences the delay and intensity of micro-explosions, disruptive burning phenomena detected at the end of the droplet lifetime. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Undesirable environmental impacts caused by fossil fuel consumption have motivated governments to focus on biofuels production. Therefore, in our paper, we design a multi-objective biodiesel supply chain from Jatropha, which includes biomass cultivation center, pretreatment, and oil extraction center, biorefinery, and demand zone. In our study, a two-stage approach presented, which first specifies candidate locations for biomass cultivation with a common weight data envelopment analysis (CWDEA) method and then strategic and tactical decisions were made by a mathematical model. The presented multi-objective model focuses on cost minimization, besides social benefits and environmental impacts maximization while a life cycle assessment approach is used to model social indicators. The capability of the model is validated by proposing a case study of Iran and the augmented ε-constraint method is employed to reach a trade-off between three pillars of sustainability while managerial insights are provided by employing a Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method for the optimal solution selection. Model's results and sensitivity analysis on key parameters, specify the best locations for Jatropha Curcas L. (JCL) cultivation and facility construction as well as an optimal value of supply chain variables, which finally proves that Iran has a high potential for biodiesel production from JCL that leads improving balanced socio-economic development in this country. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Oleaginous microalgae have emerged as the promising feedstock for biofuels due to their various advantageous features over terrestrial plants. However, the microalgal fuel industry is still in its infancy due to the unavailability of robust algal strains with enhanced lipid content and biomass and economically feasible oil extraction strategies. Microalgal metabolic engineering shows the great potential to enhance lipid accumulation without impairing cell growth by targeted control of key metabolic nodes. Despite the recent advancements in synthetic biology, genetic improvement of microalgae without hindered cellular biomass remains an untapped tool for large-scale biofuel production. In this review, we therefore provide a comprehensive overview of various metabolic engineering strategies for lipid enhancement and the necessity of designing the appropriate strategy for scale-up processes. We have emphasized the need of streamlining the engineering strategies with the aid of recent advancements in DNA manipulation techniques to obviate the existing biological intricacies in lipogenesis. We outline the significance of recruiting potential engineering strategies such as transcription engineering, heterologous recombineering, and genome engineering to generate chassis algal strains successfully. Besides, this review highlights the designing of modular strategies by subjecting the engineered strains under sub-optimal conditions, mixotrophic cultivations and chemical treatment to overcome the existing bottlenecks in microalgal commercialization. This review also discusses the current large-scale algal cultivation units and the drawbacks. Overall, this review provides insights into employing the metabolic rewiring strategies to engineer the intricate lipogenic circuit in microalgae for enhancing biofuel potential. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel and other derivative compounds which could act as biolubricants, can be a suitable alternative for petroleum products, which are less sustainable and harmful to the environment. However, especially when vegetable oils are used as raw materials (for instance Carthamus Tinctorius), these products can show poor oxidative stabilities, depending on their fatty acid composition. Apart from adding antioxidants as additives, a good alternative might be the use of genetically modified seeds to facilitate high ratios of stable fatty acids like oleic acid. The aim of this work was to produce biodiesel and biolubricant from high oleic safflower through transesterification with methanol and 2-ethyl-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol, respectively. The efficiency of these processes and the quality characterization of biodiesel and biolubricant were assessed. As a result, the biodiesel obtained (HOSBD) complied with the standard, with a high oxidative stability value (8.2 h) and not requiring any antioxidant addition. The biolubricant obtained (HOSBL) showed higher oxidative stability (6.72 h) compared to their equivalents produced from rapeseed (Brassica Napus) or cardoon (Cynara Cardunculus L.). Consequently, two stable bioproducts were obtained and the role of fatty acid composition of raw material was vital (oleic/linoleic ratio had a strong influence on oxidative stability). In that sense, the use of stable raw materials like high oleic safflower might avoid antioxidant addition in biodiesel or biolubricants, which implies a cleaner and more sustainable production. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Treated urban wastewater (TWW) is seen as a potential alternative for agricultural irrigation in arid west Texas region, due to scarcity of Freshwater (FW) supplies. However, TWW can potentially cause soil salinization and affect soil quality and crop productivity. Therefore, crops that are salt-tolerant and less water-intensive are needed to sustain agriculture in this region. Canola (Brassica napus L.) as an edible oilseed and biodiesel/biofuel crop, is salt-tolerant and relatively less water-intensive than crops that are traditional to this area. This two–year field study evaluated the performance of canola under TWW irrigation in terms of its seed yield potential and seed quality (oil content, oil yield and salt constituents), along with quantifying changes in soil salinity and sodicity. Experimental design included a randomized block split-plot with water quality (FW and TWW) as the main-plot and soil amendment (gypsum + sulfur and no-amendment) as the subplot factor. Results show that TWW application did not significantly affect canola seed yields in any of the two years. On average, seed yields were 1975 kg ha−1 across all treatments and years. Seed oil content, oil yield and mineral constituents were also not affected by TWW irrigation. Nevertheless, average seed oil content was 42 % and oil yield was 849 kg ha−1. Other than the effects on soil salinity and sodicity, Gypsum + Sulfur application did not influence canola seed productivity and quality. Changes in soil salinity and sodicity were more prominent under TWW irrigation but the levels were below the thresholds after two years. Gypsum + Sulfur application significantly reduced soil sodicity, especially in TWW irrigated soils. These results highlight that TWW can be successfully used to grow canola as a biofuel feedstock in this arid region while following appropriate soil management practices to alleviate sodicity hazard of TWW in the long-term. © 2021

AB  - The quest for an alternative sustainable source without petroleum technology and its refining has prompted the development of biofuels, such as biodiesel, from the transesterification of new or utilized vegetable oil. This work is devoted to the investigation of the transesterification of a used vegetable oil and optimization of the various parameters influencing the synthesis of biodiesel, such as the molar proportion (alcohol/oil), the amount of catalyst added and their weight percentage, the type of alcohol, the temperature T(°C) and the reaction time. From this standpoint, the current work's significant target is to propel the preliminary conditions of the transesterification response of fatty oils to create biodiesel from utilized vegetable oils. Diverse physicochemical characteristics were investigated (in terms of density, viscosity, acidity index, pour point, and flash point) to obtain biodiesel accordingly with international standards and commercial biodiesel. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - In recent years, the concerns of non-biodegradable mixed plastic waste have been growing and resulting in strengthening of technologies devoted to convert waste into energy. This study examined the technique to extract plastic oil from mixed plastic, non-biodegradable waste. Further, the mechanical characteristics of plastic pyrolysis oil were done. Pyrolysis method was used to extract the oil from plastic waste with screw reactor and the chemical compounds and the characterization of this oil was analyzed. The Fe2O3 doped Al2O3 was dispersed to enhance the quality of Waste pyrolysis oil (PO) by ultrasonication. The performance and emission characteristics of various fuels at different load conditions were analyzed by conducting a series of tests in single cylinder 4 stroke water cooled diesel engine. The benefit of the addition of 25 ppm of Fe2O3 doped Al2O3 in PO was represented graphically. A series of tests was conducted for various brake mean effective pressure of 1.3 bar, 2.6 bar, 3.9 bar and 5.2 bar for the test blends, PO (neat pyrolysis oil) and P25A (25% PO+ 75% diesel with 25 ppm of Al2O3). From the procured results, the addition of the novel nanoparticles increases the production of brake power by 35% with reduced emission of 45% and 60% of HC and CO2 respectively. On the other hand, the NOx emission was reduced by 15% and 9 % than the neat plastic oil and diesel fuel. Further, the usage of the pyrolysis oil at 25% generated the positive effects on both combustion and emission compared to neat PO. © 2021

AB  - Brazil is one of the major players in the biofuels market worldwide, and its existing biorefining infrastructure can be used as the basis to support the implementation of new advanced biofuel production routes at a large scale. This paper demonstrates the benefits of the integration of both biochemical and thermochemical processes and how this configuration has the potential to overcome the main barriers that the Biomass-to-Liquids (BtL) route currently faces. Important bottlenecks such as the high equipment costs, low industrial process efficiency, and high feedstock prices were studied in detail by assessing a series of production scenarios that take into account the Brazilian context for building new biorefinery plants. By carrying out a techno-economic analysis aided by a simulation framework (the Virtual Sugarcane Biorefinery), we evaluated the potential technological synergies of a BtL plant processing sugarcane bagasse and straw integrated into a first-generation sugarcane ethanol distillery. Results in this paper indicate that it is possible to achieve economic feasibility with the implementation of the BtL route in the country. Under a base scenario, a greenfield plant would be very close to the range of economic viability (IRR from 10 to 12% per year), whereas more optimistic economic conditions (e.g., lower CAPEX and higher fuel prices) would induce even better results (IRR greater than 16% per year). Doubling the milling capacity also favors the BtL process, with IRR reaching 20% per year if the best economic conditions are achieved in the Brazilian context. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fusel oil, a by-product of bioethanol production, can be considered as a low-value and renewable material for transforming into value-added products. In this work, the catalytic cracking of fusel oil was studied in a fixed bed reactor to produce light olefins. The operating parameters, such as the temperature, feed flow rate of fusel oil, feedstock, and the co-feeding water, were investigated over a HZSM-5 catalyst in terms of the yields and distribution of the gaseous products. The highest total carbon in the gaseous products with excellent ethylene and propylene selectivity (44.7%, 34.4%, and 28.6%, respectively) were obtained at 550 °C, a feed flow rate of 0.04 mL/min, and 0.02 g of catalyst. After a long time on stream (TOS), the stability of HZSM-5 was slightly decreased due mainly to coke deposition. Thus, the catalytic cracking of fusel oil shows the ability to be converted into light olefins. However, catalyst improvement to enhance the catalytic activity and stability is still required, at the same time, the technical process with economic feasibility still needs more development in order to be realistically useable on an industrial scale in the future. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI) strategy using fuels with different reactivity's has attracted attention due to its high thermal efficiency as well as very low NOx and PM emissions in comparison to conventional combustion. As previous studies have shown that the type and amount of low reactivity fuel have a significant contribution to the in-cylinder reactivity, thus RCCI combustion, in this study, Iso-Propanol-Butanol-Ethanol (IBE), which has comparable characteristics to n-butanol and ethanol, is employed as low reactivity fuel (LRF) in a RCCI engine fueled by petroleum based EN590 fuel and commercial biodiesel. The IBE mixture was in volumetric ratios of 3:6:1 as in the fermentation process of butanol, that is to say; 30% Iso-Propanol, 60% Butanol and 10% Ethanol. In each experimental condition, keeping the total energy of the fuel supplied to the engine in conventional combustion mode for each cycle as constant, the premixed ratio (Rp) in case RCCI combustion was applied as 0%, 15%, 30%, 45% and 60% (the amount of LRF in energy basis) over this energy amount. The effect of premixed ratio of IBE on combustion characteristics were investigated in a single-cylinder RCCI engine under different loads with using both petroleum diesel and biodiesel as high-reactivity fuels (HRF), respectively. According to experimental results, a higher in-cylinder pressure was measured by using diesel in both conventional and RCCI mode compared to the use of biodiesel. Considering the peak in-cylinder pressure and rate of heat release, the premixed ratio (Rp) of up to 45% was found as optimum for all loads while it was up to 30%Rp for the NOx emissions. In addition, the biodiesel-fueled RCCI engine produced the lowest smoke opacity in all loads and it gradually decreased by up to 97% with the application of the RCCI strategy. Furthermore, the results showed that a simultaneous reduction in NOx and smoke opacity could be obtained under 60% load and up to 30% Rp with a marginal increase in unburned HC emissions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - As a source for third-generation biofuel, microalgae can assist island countries to overcome their energy crisis. In this study, a novel photobioreactor having three segments is designed and Synechococcus HS-9 growth in the photobioreactors with and without a baffle is compared. The aims of this study are to investigate how the baffle influences bubble size, distribution, and velocity, to explain the bubble coalescence phenomena, and verify the effect of the baffle on Synechococcus HS-9 growth. The results showed that bubble size distribution in the photobioreactors paralleled the increasing air flow rate. At a flow rate of 1.0 L/min, most bubbles had a diameter of 200–400 μm; however, at 2.5 L/min, the typical size was 1400–2000 μm. Bubble velocity was observed through imaging techniques. The intake air flow rate of 1 LPM has a mass transfer coefficient value of 0.00075 m/s for the photobioreactor without the baffle and 0.00089 m/s for the baffle-bearing photobioreactor. The Sauter mean diameters at three different heights (A, B and C section) in the photobioreactors were 675 μm, 1001 μm, and 1125 μm. Synechococcus HS-9 growth was 2.17 times higher in the baffle-bearing photobioreactor than that in the photobioreactor without the baffle. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Despite the massive electrification of the energy sector, combustion-based technologies will continue to play a key role for decades to come. Therefore, to meet the ambitious target of decarbonization of the energy sector, adapting current technologies to alternative energy sources, like biofuels, is a must. The proposed work aims at investigating the role of biomass producer gas in compression ignition (CI) engines, as a substitute of diesel fuel. A micro combined heat and power generation system (CHP) consisting of an open-top downdraft gasifier, a single-cylinder water-cooled CI engine and a waste heat recovery circuit have been set-up with the aim to investigate emissions and performance at several Diesel Substitution Rates (DSR), up to 50 %. Maximum substitution levels – which occur due to knocking limitations and combustion instabilities - have been also identified. The main results show: i) a decrease of thermal and electrical efficiencies in the range of 10–30 %; ii) strong NOx and smoke opacity reductions (with peaks close to 80 %); iii) an increase of CO emissions (above 50 %); iv) the assessment of a decreasing maximum DSR as the power load increase (98 % at the lowest load, up to 46 % at full load). Such findings offer quantitative results through which multi-objective optimization procedures could be implemented. Moreover, experimental results indicate the need for a diesel injection timing optimization strategy to mitigate CO emissions. © 2021

AB  - Biodiesel is typically produced from a wide variety of edible vegetable oils. The cost of biofuels is projected to rise in the future as an alternative and ecologically suitable replacement to traditional fuel. Reliable and inexpensive raw materials, including meat processing by-products or waste animal fats, have rapidly attracted interest in biodiesel production. The operational and reaction parameters play an important role in the conversion of processes and biodiesel yield. Kinetic models explain the reaction rate and process optimization to improve the biodiesel conversion process. The process intensification approaches applied by different researchers are illustrated in the current study. This paper proposes a groundbreaking solution to stepping up biodiesel development by utilizing a coalescer reactor and a preliminary review to justify the solution's potential for further analysis. Optimization techniques and kinetics studies used to enhance biodiesel production from renewable sources are explored in the current review paper. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Despite biofuels’ significance in substituting petroleum products in the transportation sector, many countries, including Ethiopia, have not taken advantage of their biomass resources potential to develop biofuel. This is attributed to several challenges, in which the economic unattractiveness, especially the requirement of excessively high initial investment costs, is the major one. To address this challenge, a quantitative-based design and planning of the biomass-to-biofuel supply chain (BBSC), which is backed by optimization, is compulsory. Henceforth, this study intends to develop an optimization model that seeks to maximize the profit and minimize the investment cost of the BBSC. The optimization model is applied to the real case of Ethiopia's BBSC to provide a planning support tool for the policy-makers over a 20-year horizon. Although several economic optimization models developed so far, this contribution broadens the preceding research endeavors by considering the following efforts simultaneously. An integrated strategic-tactical level model is developed to prevent non-optimal and infeasible results, which might arise from separate models. Adverse to the integrated strategic-tactical models developed so far, a multi-product BBSC that produces bioethanol and biodiesel with the associated co-products and a comprehensive supply chain, which incorporates a decentralized preprocessing unit, along with the other relevant components, is considered. The investment decisions related to location, technology, and capacity of facilities happen on yearly basis, unlike many studies that consider this decision only at the beginning of the planning period. The model size boosts as it is a real and comprehensive national-level case study. Therefore, a new approach is proposed here to analyze the compromise between the objectives in a justifiable computational time with efficient optimization resolution. A sensitivity analysis is also carried out on biomass purchase price and availability, as well as biofuel demand and selling price. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Crude palm oil (CPO)-based biodiesel is Indonesia's main product as part of the Government of Indonesia's (GoI) biofuel policy to secure energy, reduce trade balance deficit and subsidy, and lower emissions. Indonesia's biodiesel policy is progressive. In late 2019, biodiesel blending reached 30% of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) and 70% of diesel, known as B30. The government sees the biodiesel policy as beneficial on the basis of its expected diesel import saving. However, it fails to take into account the potential export loss emerging from the opportunity cost of foreign exchange. Moreover, the macroeconomic impacts of biodiesel policy remain understudied. Using available input and output data, CPO and biodiesel projected balance sheets were constructed for 2020 to 2030 based on four biodiesel blending scenarios. Assessments were then made to reveal each scenario's impact on trade balance, subsidy, and land expansion. The present study found that: (1) while the biodiesel policy lowers diesel imports, the potential CPO export loss outweighs the import savings, (2) the biodiesel policy's impact on subsidy is highly dependent on the subsidy rate of FAME and diesel, and (3) land expansion of 48% to 76% of current productive oil palm plantation area is inevitable to support the ambitious biodiesel policy. Overall, the findings indicate that more progressive policies pose greater macroeconomic and environmental risks. The GoI should develop a clear roadmap for optimal biodiesel blending levels to deliver energy security and desirable economic and environmental impacts. © 2021

AB  - The European community foresees a 15% CO2 tailpipe emissions restriction in 2025 and 30% in 2030 for the trucks. While battery electric vehicles would help to reach these levels, their low ranges make them unfeasible for the good transport sector. By this reason, hybrid vehicles are considered the bridge between the current technology and the battery electric vehicles. The 48 V mild hybrid technology is an effective solution due to its low cost and changes needed with respect to the current technology. It also allows the use of electrical components that help to improve the brake thermal efficiency, reduce the emissions and recover energy. This works explores the potential of an electric turbo compound (e-TC) and an electric exhaust gas recirculation pump (e-EGR pump) in a mild hybrid truck platform working under dual-mode dual-fuel (DMDF) combustion with diesel and gasoline. The e-components are simulated by means of 0D-Engine modeling. Finally, a general overview of the potential in real applications is done by means of a vehicle model considering different driving cycles and truck payloads for two truck platforms (18-ton and 25-ton maximum payload). The results show that to achieve the large EGR rates required by the DMDF combustion and meet the air requirements, it necessary the use of both e-components together. The evaluation at vehicle conditions allows to conclude that the mild hybrid platform allows to reduce the CO2 emissions around 6% in homologation conditions and 10% in urban cycles. Moreover, it was found that the use of e-components only improves the vehicle efficiency in the cases with low truck payloads. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Due to Koelreuteria paniculata Laxm., high abundance in Novi Sad (Serbia) and previously confirmed biodiesel feedstock suitability, this study aimed to assess generative potential and yield, assess K. paniculata invasive risk, and investigate the influence of harvesting periods on the oil content and quality. Fifty-five specimens present in the Novi Sad inner-city core exhibited very high scores in the conducted invasiveness risk assessment (score 35/39). Determined good overall adaptability, growth and development, vitality and decorativeness of K. paniculata specimens, as well as the absence of phytopathological and entomological damages, due to lack of natural enemies, provided this species high unhindered yielding. The majority of investigated trees reached 5–10 m in height and canopy volumes from 10.1 to 70 m3, with an estimated more than 130 000–700 000 seeds produced per canopy. Seeds from one representative specimen were collected on different harvesting dates, at the end of August, September and October of 2019, and analyzed for oil content and quality for biodiesel production. With the average oil percentage of 22.8 w%, determined in the representative specimen, investigated 55 seed-bearing K. paniculata trees merely in the inner city core of Novi Sad, could produce 115 kg of oil. Since oil properties (&lt;1 w% of free fatty acids and the acid number &lt;2 mgKOH.g−1) and fatty acid profile (high content of monounsaturated fatty acids ≈72 w%) fit the requirements set in EN14214 biodiesel standard, regardless of the harvest date, harvest season can be extended to at least three months without compromising the oil quality for biodiesel production. Thus, intrinsic disservice of K. paniculata – high seed yielding can be shifted into a novel ecosystem service – quality biodiesel production. Aiming to avoid viable seed deposition in the ground and formation of the invasive seed bank, early August harvest can be recommended. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Palm biodiesel has emerged as a potential renewable fuel to substitute vehicle fossil fuel in Malaysia. The embodied environmental impacts due to palm biodiesel upstream production processes are often overlooked and not thoroughly investigated. This study identifies the environmental hotspots of all palm biodiesel upstream production processes (from palm tree cultivation to refined palm biodiesel production) using life cycle assessment methodology. The result shows that the major environmental hotspots are the agricultural stage (fresh fruit bunch plantation) and milling stage, totaling up to 81–92% of the overall environmental loads. Fossil fuel utilization, chemical fertilizers application, and transportation are the key activities that induce the overall upstream burdens, contributing to 69–82% of the damage assessment. The findings reveal that air particulate matters, greenhouse gases, and heavy metals are the main chemical compounds that escalate the environmental burdens in major environmental hotspots in the upstream processes. A configuration setup of crude palm kernel oil plant located within the mill with anaerobic digestion shows a reduction of 4.13–12.2% of environmental impacts compared to the baseline scenario in Malaysia. This study suggests practical environmental reduction solutions to allow stakeholders to construct a more sustainable palm biodiesel upstream production. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Outbreaks of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms present a serious threat to ecosystem safety and human well-being. Removal of toxic cyanobacterial biomass from freshwaters and its safe utilization is a worldwide problem. We showed that regulation of intracellular carbon flow by applying nitrogen deprivation strategy with light and inorganic carbon manipulation during the cultivation of cyanobacterium Microcystis allows efficiently convert its biomass into the biofuel feedstock. The proteomic analysis demonstrated that highly efficient feedstock production can be achieved during Microcystis culturing by nitrogen deprivation, which slows down the catabolic consumption of carbohydrates in cells. Further, we developed a novel approach that allows converting the natural Microcystis biomass into carbohydrate-rich feedstock by maintaining a high rate of carbohydrate production at minimal biomass losses. The yield attains 0.22 g ethanol per gram dry biomass, which is in the range of the ethanol yield of sugarcane, but higher than the values of sugarcane waste. The suggested approach provides cost-effective technology for sustainable green energy production from nuisance cyanobacterial biomass. The massive removal of toxic cyanobacterial biomass for bioethanol productions can mitigate the harmful cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic lakes, and positively affect their restoration. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Owing to significant advantages over traditional biofuels, 2-methylfuran (MF) has arisen extensive interest as next generation biofuels. Atmospheric pressure pyrolysis of a 1:1 blend of MF with a three-component (3C) surrogate jet fuel was conducted in a flow tube using synchrotronphotoionization and molecular beam mass spectrometry techniques within a temperature range of 898–1223 K. Therein, the 3C surrogate fuel consists of 66.2% n-dodecane (NC12H26), 18.0% 1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane (T135MCH) and 15.8% n-propylbenzene (NPB, A1C3H7). The detailed kinetic model including 579 species and 3474 reactions was developed via validating against both measured and literature data with reasonable agreement. MF exhibits no obvious influence on the 3C components pyrolysis. However, 3C mixtures play an important roles in MF decomposition: lower initial temperature and different decomposition pathways. In the meantime, n-propylbenzene (NPB) pyrolysis curve in 3C and 3C+MF significantly transfers to low temperature zone after 1000 K in contrast to pure NPB, while smaller change was found in the decomposition curve of n-dodecane. Compared with 3C pyrolysis, 3C+MF blends have less formation of aromatic species and light hydrocarbons except for vinylacetylene (C4H4) and acetylene (C2H2). Allyl radical (C3H3) has significant roles in benzene ring formation. The combination of allyl radical with propargyl radical producing benzene and H radical (aC3H5 + C3H3 = A1 + 2H) has the highest contribution to the benzene formation in both 3C and 3C+MF. Moreover, most of naphthalene (A2) formation is also related to C3H3 radical via reaction: A1CH2 + C3H3 = A2 + H, rather than via HACA (hydrogen abstraction carbon addition) reaction. Interaction of fuel blends was mainly presented through the common and important sensitive reactions which are much to do with CH3 and H radicals. The overview of product distribution was investigated by providing comparisons of carbon conversion rates during the pyrolysis of 3C and 3C+MF. These results will be helpful to better understand the pyrolysis properties of MF/jet fuel surrogate blends and could contribute to developing new generation biofuels for aviation. © 2021

AB  - Biodiesel has been emerging as a potential and promising biofuel for the strategy of reducing toxic emissions and improving engine performance. Computational methods aiming to offer numerical solutions were inevitable as a study methodology which was sometimes considered the only practical method. Artificial neural networks (ANN) were data-processing systems, which were used to tackle many issues in engineering and science, especially in some fields where there was a failure of the conventional modeling approaches. Thus, it was believed that the best choice was the development of a novel approach like the ANN model to anticipate engine performance and exhaust emissions with high accuracy. In this review paper, the structure and applicability of the ANN model were comprehensively evaluated. More importantly, the use of ANN with trained, tested, and validated data was introduced to determine the performance and emission characteristics of a diesel engine fueled with biodiesel-based fuel. In general, the ANN model could supply a relatively high determination coefficient as compared between predicted results and experimental data, showing that the ANN model could have a good ability to predict the engine behaviors with an accuracy higher than 95%. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Commercial production of jet fuel from biobased feedstocks is still encumbering, mainly due to their high production cost and competition with food resources. Pennycress oilseed is a potential jet fuel feedstock which can be supplied at a lower price compared to similar oilseeds, such as soybean and canola. However, the techno-economics of pennycress-based jet fuel production needs to be evaluated. The objective of this study was to assess the technical feasibility and costs of hydroprocessed renewable jet fuel (HRJ) production from pennycress. The production capacity was considered to be 18.9 million L/yr (5 million gal/yr). The analysis considered pennycress grain handling and conditioning, oil extraction and conversion to HRJ and byproducts, i.e., LPG, naphtha and green diesel, through hydroprocessing technology, as well as pennycress meal processing as boiler fuel and wastewater treatment. Total investment for establishing the HRJ biorefinery at the selected capacity was estimated to be 90.8 million USD. Minimum selling price (MSP) of HRJ was estimated to be 1.2 USD/L, which was comparable to the MSP of HRJ from similar oilseeds, including soybean and canola. It could also be further reduced by supplying pennycress grain at a lower price, increasing the oil content and increasing the production capacity of the biorefinery. The outcomes of this research would help establish the performance targets needed to reach the economic viability of HRJ production from pennycress at the commercial scale. © 2021

AB  - Fossil fuel depletion and strict government regulations have necessitated the finding of alternatives to conventional fuel sources. The growing population and better transport are increasing the need for energy every day. The pollution and disposal of agriculture and food waste are still serious problems to be tackled. Bioethanol has proved an alternative to S.I. engine diesel and gasoline. 10% ethanol blending is widely used by passenger cars worldwide and countries such as India have announced the implementation of a 20% ethanol blending in petrol. As a result, demand for ethanol is growing and there is inadequate bioethanol supply to meet demand. This paper portrays the extraction of ethanol from the waste pomegranate fruits and effect of its different blends on the spark ignited engine performance. Ethanol was extracted using fermentation and steam distillation processes from waste pomegranate fruit. Four blends were prepared on volumetric basis and tested for various performance and emission parameters at a constant compression ratio of 10:1 and wide-open throttle at various engine speeds. Indicated power, volumetric efficiency, and mechanical efficiency were improved by ethanol enrichment. Enrichments of ethanol decrease emissions of HC, CO and CO2, however increase nitrogen oxide emissions. The engine performance was found optimal for WPFE15 among all fuel blend studied. This study recommends the use of waste pomegranate fruits as a source for production of second-generation ethanol if after treatments be performed to reduce NOx emissions. This study proposes the use of waste pomegranate fruits for second-generation ethanol processing, if NOx pollution after treatment is carried out. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Livestock manures significantly contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and soil contamination if not valorised or disposed of properly. Meanwhile, hydrothermal liquefaction has emerged as a promising technology for the conversion of wet wastes into value-added products. As such, this study investigates the potential of hydrothermal liquefaction of camel manure and subsequent upgrading into drop-in fuels in Qatar. Experimental characterisation of manure samples is conducted, while a small-scale plant is simulated and evaluated using Aspen Plus®. Excess treated wastewater of Qatar is utilised as an alternative to fresh water in the process, while power is completely generated on-site. The demonstrated results are promising; whereby, a biocrude yield of 37.9% (on dry and ash-free basis) is achieved, while the biocrude is upgraded into a high-quality bio-gasoline. The produced bio-gasoline contributes to a 7% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions relative to conventional gasoline. The project capital investment is estimated to be 38 M$, while the bio-gasoline's minimum selling price is at 0.87 $/kg, which is still above the market price of conventional gasoline in Qatar (∼0.6 $/kg). However, the conducted sensitivity analysis indicates that scaling-up the plant by 5-fold can shift the fuel's minimum selling price below the average market price. As such, it has a high potential to be locally commercialised especially at times of petroleum price hikes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The critical temperatures, pressures, heat capacities, and thermal diffusivities of 2-methylfuran, 2,5-dimethylfuran, and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran have been measured. Heat capacities and thermal diffusivities have been measured at atmospheric pressure in the temperature ranges from 298.00 to 473.15 K and from 289.15 to 303.15 K, respectively. The temperature dependencies of heat capacities have been approximated by third-order polynomials. The coefficients of these polynomials are given. Experimental critical constants have been compared with those calculated using the group contribution methods of Wilson and Jasperson, Nannoolal et al., Marrero and Gani, and Hukkerikar et al. The thermal conductivities of the compounds under study have been calculated using experimental data and estimated by the group contribution methods of Govender et al. and Liu et al. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Gas turbines are designed to run on specific fuels such as conventional fuels, so researchers are working to find alternative fuels as biodiesel. The purpose of this study is predicting the engine performance and emissions rate for the KingTech K180 turbojet engine running on dual biodiesel and its blend with Jet-A fuel. Besides that, this paper explores the different effect between dual blends and single blend. The fuel parameters were calculated based on each fuel's physicochemical properties to produce nine different blends of dual biodiesel (B10-Jet, B30-Jet, B50-Jet, B70-Jet, and B90-Jet) and a single biodiesel blend (POME50: Jet-A50). Then the heat of combustion for each blend was obtained using the GasTurb Details-6. After that, the design point was determined of the specific engine and operates it using alternative fuels to analyze the performance and emissions characteristics (CO, CO2, and NOx). This study found that the B10-Jet blend gave the best specific fuel consumption (SFC) value, 42.43 (g/kN.s). It also produced a lower emissions rate for CO and CO2 than Jet-A fuel and other blends. While emission index NOx was high for all blends, except B10-Jet fuel value was close to Jet-A fuel emission value. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Syngas (for synthetic gas) is a well known gaseous biofuel, also known as producer gas or wood gas. It is composed mainly of N2, CO2, CO, H2 and CH4, with varying shares depending on the gasification process and biomass source. When syngas is used in Internal Combustion engines for stationary electricity generation, the operation modes have to be adapted. The problem is that, for the moment, the combustion parameters of complex syngas compositions are not fully covered by the literature. In this study, the laminar flame speeds and Markstein lengths are measured for three syngas compositions. These compositions were chosen to represent typical production of three types of gasifiers (Updraft, Downdraft and Fluidized Bed). Measurements were made at varying initial temperatures (298–423 K), pressures (1–5 bar) and equivalence ratios (0.6–1.4). The method used was the outwardly propagating spherical method. Higher H2 and CO contents on the Updraft and Downdraft compositions produced flame speeds two times higher than the Fluidbed composition. Results were compared to the data from the only two previous studies but no quantitative agreement was found. The results obtained from kinetic modeling with four kinetic mechanisms provide a global agreement specially those from the CRECK mechanism that only deviated from the experimental results by 5–10%. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Co-cultures of different microorganisms are considered promising inocula for treating palm oil mill effluents (POME) and producing value-added bio-products (e.g., biofuels and fatty acid-derived materials). However, the efficiency of yeast-bacteria co-culture for microbial lipid production through bioremediation of wastewater remains a bottleneck. In this study, the performance of a co-culture for lipid accumulation through POME bioremediation was investigated using a yeast (Lipomyces starkeyi) and a bacterium (Bacillus cereus). A maximum biomass of 8.89 ± 0.33 g/L and lipid production of 2.27 ± 0.10 g/L were achieved by the co-culture inoculum, which were substantially higher than those of the monocultures. Besides, the co-culture inoculum attained a maximum chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal of 83.66 ± 1.9%, while the individual cultures of B. cereus and L. starkeyi obtained 74.35 ± 1.7% and 69.01 ± 2.3%, respectively. The bioremediation efficiency was confirmed by the seed germination index (GI) of Vigna radiata (Mung bean). It was observed that the co-culture inoculum had a higher GI compared to the untreated POME and even the monoculture-treated POME. We argue that the symbiotic association of a yeast-bacteria co-culture in POME could be an attractive approach for achieving maximum biomass as well as lipid production and simultaneous bioremediation of POME. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The increase in global population size over the past 100 decades has doubled the requirements for energy resources. To mitigate the limited fossil fuel available, new clean energy sources being environmental sustainable for replacement of traditional energy sources are explored to supplement the current scarcity. Biomass containing lignin and cellulose is the main raw material to replace fossil energy given its abundance and lower emission of greenhouse gases and NOx when transformed into energy. Bacteria, fungi and algae decompose lignocellulose leading to generation of hydrogen, methane, bioethanol and biodiesel being the clean energy used for heating, power generation and the automobile industry. Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) uses microorganisms to decompose biomass in wastewater to generate electricity and remove heavy metals in wastewater. Biomass contains cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and other biomacromolecules which need hydrolyzation for conversion into small molecules by corresponding enzymes in order to be utilized by microorganisms. This paper discusses microbial decomposition of biomass into clean energy and the five major ways of clean energy production, and its economic benefits for future renewable energy security. © 2021

AB  - This study reports on the novel Saccharomyces cerevisiae CU-TPD4 that was isolated from coconut waste residues obtained from a coconut factory in Thailand. The CU-TPD4 isolate was confirmed to be a S. cerevisiae by molecular analysis and to be an oleaginous yeast with more than 20% (w/w) of the cell dry weight (CDW) present in the form of lipids. The lipid content and lipid yield of CU-TPD4 (52.96 ± 1.15% of CDW and 1.78 ± 0.06 g/L, respectively) under optimized growth conditions were much higher than those under normal growth conditions (22.65 ± 1.32% of CDW and 1.24 ± 0.12 g/L, respectively). The major fatty acids produced by CU-TPD4 were oleic (C18:1), palmitoleic (C16:1), stearic (C18:0), and palmitic (C16:0) acids. Mathematical estimation of the physical properties of the biodiesel obtained by transesterification of the extracted lipid suggested it was suitable as biodiesel with respect to the ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 international standards. Consequently, S. cerevisiae CU-TPD4 is expected to emerge as a promising alternative for biodiesel production. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The effects of adding ethanol on the macroscopic and microscopic spray characteristics of biodiesel were investigated by experimental and numerical methods. The spray tip penetration (STP) was recorded with a high-speed camera system, while the statistical size distribution of atomized droplets and the Sauter mean diameter (SMD) were obtained using a Malvern laser particle size analyzer. The spray calculation models were established with Fluent software, and the calculation results were validated by the experimental results. Then the numerical simulation of the spray characteristics for diesel, biodiesel, and biodiesel–ethanol fuel blends were conducted. The results showed that the farther the distance is from the nozzle exit, the lower the concentration and the velocity of atomized droplets. The concentration and the velocity of atomized droplets gradually decrease along the radial direction, extending from the center to the periphery. The turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) at the front and rear of the spray is relatively lower, while the TKE is higher in the middle of the spray, and turbulent vortices appear on both sides of the axial spray center. In addition, the spray characteristics of the different fuels revealed that compared to diesel, the STP and SMD of biodiesel increase by 33.59% and 33.08% on average, respectively. The maximum concentration of biodiesel is higher than that of diesel, and the concentration distribution is more concentrated. The droplet velocity and TKE of biodiesel respectively decrease by 7.38% and 14.49% in comparison to diesel. When ethanol was added to biodiesel by a volume percentage of 30%, the STP and SMD of biodiesel–ethanol fuel blends reduce by 22.05% and 20.88%, respectively. The concentration distribution, the velocity distribution, and the TKE distribution of the fuel blends are similar to that of diesel. This indicates that adding 30% ethanol to biodiesel can effectively improve its spray quality. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Livestock waste products have been shown to be a viable source of biofuel. Although research have shown that animal excreta may be used to produce bioethanol, there are scanty of reports on the use of piggery (Sus scrofa) excreta for bioethanol production. The goal of this study was to produce bioethanol on a modest scale from pig excreta using a conventional anaerobically fermentation technique with Saccharomyces cervices. Using piggery excreta, we were able to produce 0.765–1.02 gm/200 mL of 89.59 percent pure bioethanol. Gas chromatography (GC) was used to evaluate the single distilled solvent generated from the pretreated (with 4% H2SO4) and fermented pig excreta, which indicated 89.59 percent purity and a retention time of 4.104 min that was closer to absolute ethanol values. The signal peaks indicating the CH3, OH, and CH2 groups of ethyl alcohol were detected employing proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) analysis of the fermented distilled colourless from pig excreta. The antibacterial activity of bioethanol was also evaluated against several gram positive and negative pathogens, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was found to be between 11 and 25 g/mL. The potential of piggery excreta as an alternative source of bioethanol production and antibacterial agents were identified in this early investigation. In view of public health concerns as well as pollution prevention, pig manure disposal is a critical concern. In developing countries, industrialized small-scale pig farming has exploded, but the environmental issues that come with it have yet to be fully recognized. This research might lead to a more inventive and intelligent method for piggery waste/excreta disposal. As a result, policymakers may wish to consider adopting this approach for piggery farm waste/excreta management in the future, resulting in cleaner production and improved environmental conditions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Increasing travel demand, incomplete combustion of fuel in an engine, vehicle exhaust emissions such as NOx, CO and particular matter and global warming urge the fuel modification methods by using nano additives and alternative fuel. Suitable preparation method, characterization and fuel additive application of nickel-copper-carbide nanocomposite (Ni–CuC NC) have been rarely reported due to lack of research. On this ground, the present research illustrated the synthesis of nickel-copper bimetallic nanoparticles (Ni–Cu BNPs) with copper chloride (CuCl2) and nickel nitrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O) salt precursors in the presence of sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Followed by the reinforcement of calcium carbide (CaC2) with Ni–Cu BNPs to prepare Ni–CuC nanocomposite via hydrothermal approach. Structural composition and morphological analysis of the Ni–CuC nanocomposite was studied by XRD and SEM respectively. Physical and combustion fuel properties were investigated at 20, 40, 60 and 80 ppm concentration of Ni–Cu BNPs and Ni–CuC nanocomposite respectively for fuel-efficiency. Flash and fire point of diesel fuel in the absence of additives was observed as 78 and 82 °C respectively. Whereas, 80 ppm fuel blend of Ni–CuC and Ni–Cu show a remarkable decrease in flash point up to 69 and 72 °C respectively. The decreasing trend for fire point observed up to 72 and 74 °C respectively. A tremendous recorded decrease in kinematic viscosity was 1.51 and 1.75 m2/s with Ni–CuC and Ni–Cu. Ni–Cu BNPs and Ni–CuC nanocomposite in term of fuel efficiency and environment friendly emission could be recognized as potential candidates in diesel. Future work on Ni–Cu BNPs and Ni–CuC nanocomposite as fuel additives for enhancing fuel or biofuel parameters as a photocatalyst for various dye removal in wastewater treatment, as sensing agent in sensing technology as well as for chemical reaction catalysis could be encouraged. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biofuels may reduce road transport carbon intensity; however, it is uncertain whether displacing fossil diesel would alter the engine-derived particulate toxicity. The primary objective of this work was to determine whether there is a fuel effect on the comparative in vitro toxicity of biodiesel exhaust particulates relative to those from fossil diesel. A secondary aim was to determine qualitatively whether the observed outcome is related to the organic phase, namely Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs). In vitro and acellular exposure studies were recovered from a literature survey following the PRISMA framework. Biological responses attributable to biodiesel and paired fossil diesel particles, including particle-extracts were selected. To qualify for inclusion, either of the paired responses must differ statistically significantly (p < 0.05) from the control or each other. Paired responses were assigned to one-of-five categories which best represents the pathophysiological role of the biomarker: inflammation, oxidative stress, cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and mutagenicity. Biodiesel reduced particle toxicity in two-thirds of paired responses, however, there were large differences between biodiesels for category-specific biomarkers. Particles derived from Rapeseed oil Methyl Ester (RME) were less inflammatory, whereas Soybean oil Methyl Ester (SME) particles were more inflammatory than fossil diesel on average. Conversely, SME reduced oxidative stress while few trends emerged for mutagenicity and genotoxicity. The largest fuel effect was observed for cytotoxicity: Waste Cooking Oil Methyl Ester (WCOME) increased and Palm oil Methyl Ester (PME) decreased particle cytotoxicity. Particle-phase PAH emissions compiled on a mass-of-soot basis also followed this trend, however, literature focusing on both these aspects is limited; careful consideration of fuel composition and use of normal primary human cell types and omics technologies, could resolve this open question. This assessment systematically compares biological responses from particulate only exposure, with co-exposure necessarily excluded due to an absence of understanding of how gaseous components modify particulate toxicity. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Torrefaction is a thermochemical process used to convert the biomass into solid fuel. In this study, torrefaction increased the raw microalgal biomass’ energy content from 20.22 MJ⋅kg−1 to 27.93 MJ⋅kg−1. To determine if more energy is produced than energy consumption from torrefaction, this study identified the energy balance of torrefied microalgal biomass production based on a life cycle approach. The energy analysis showed that, among all processes, torrefaction had the least amount of energy demand. The experimental setup, defined as scenario A, revealed that the principal source of energy demand, about 85%, was consumed on the microalgal growth using a photobioreactor system. A sensitivity analysis was also performed to determine the varying energy demand for torrefied microalgal biomass production. The different types of cultivation methods and various production scales were considered in scenarios B to D. Scenario D, which represented the commercial production-scale, the energy demand drastically decreased by 59.46% as compared to the experimental setup (scenario A). The open-pond cultivation system resulted in the least energy requirement, regardless of the production scale (scenarios B and C) among all the given scenarios. Unlike scenarios A and D, scenarios B and C identified the drying process to consume a high amount of energy. All the scenarios have shown an energy demand deficit. Therefore, efforts to decrease the energy demand on the upstream processes are needed to make the torrefied microalgal biomass a viable alternative energy source. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - It is essential to increase the production of foods to meet the increasing future food demand, but this should be done in an environmentally sustainable manner. Integrated crop-livestock systems have been suggested to balance the reduction of environmental impacts and the increase in food production. Here we assessed and compared the environmental impacts of specialized (SPC) and integrated (ITG) rice and beef production systems in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, using a life-cycle assessment (LCA). The productions of rice and beef are separated in the SPC, whereas they are integrated in the ITG: cattle manure is treated by a biodigester for biogas production, its digestate is applied to rice paddy fields as fertilizer, and part of the rice straw is used as cattle feed. We developed an LCA model based on data collected by site investigations of rice and beef farms and the relevant literature and LCA databases. Our evaluation of the ITG and SPC rice-beef production systems using the LCA revealed that among the four environmental impact categories investigated herein, the ITG had less environmental impacts on climate change (22%), energy consumption (22%), and eutrophication (14%) compared to the SPC. With the ITG, the reduction of methane emissions from paddy fields, the avoided energy consumption by the biogas produced, and the lower ammonia, nitrate, and phosphorous emissions from cattle manure and no eutrophying pollutant emissions from grassland were the main contributors to the lower greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, and eutrophication potential of this system, respectively. A sensitivity analysis showed that the use of cover for digestate storage resulted in lower environmental impacts of the ITG system compared to SPC system in all of the impact categories investigated here. These results provide helpful information to develop a circular and resource-efficient rice and beef production system that balances increasing productivity with environmental sustainability in rice-producing countries, particularly in Asia. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The CNG usage as a fuel in IC engines have many advantages such as decreasing CO2 and PM and smoke emissions and in many cases reducing NOx emission, along with its low prices and naturally abundance spread on the world. In heavy loaded operation of diesel engines, it becomes very hard to control excessive NOx, and PM formation in the exhaust emissions and smoke accumulation especially for biodiesel usage. In the present study, in order to achieve the usability of higher percentages of biodiesel with CNG, the low temperature combustion of reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI) strategy have been applied in a single cylinder diesel engine with variable compression ratios. The CNG, as the low reactivity fuel, was subjected to the intake manifold as the substitute the gas with 5%, 10% and 15% of biodiesel under 1500 rpm and 10.8 kW(full load) load of the engine with variable compression ratios from 13:1 to 19:1 in order to investigate the effects of compression ratios on RCCI operation with high percentages of biodiesel and CNG usage. Apart from the main performance, emissions and combustion indicators of diesel engines tests, 3 novel parameters (SPE, STE and SHRE) were created for the first time in order to deeply evaluate the combustion. Mean of cylinder pressure was increased while combustion duration was lowered for CNG usage with biodiesel. BTE was increased while BSEC and BSFC were decreased in either operation of biodiesel/CNG RCCI and various CR. In addition, NOx emissions were lowered for CNG usage and CR decrease, along with smoke decrease for biodiesel/CNG RCCI combustion. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present research project, the energy crop peelu non-edible oil was investigated as a potential source for fatty acid methyl esters production, using hybrid metallic nano-particles. The energy crop peelu is an evergreen shrubby plant distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Naturally, the plant has having a worthy fates masses, had proceeded an optimum results for quantitative and qualitative methyl esters production, using hybrid metallic nano-particles poly-N-isopropylacrylamide “PNIPAM-Cu, PNIPAM-Pd & PNIPAM-Cu@Pd”. Whereas, the carboxyl functionalized P(NIPAM) microgels was synthesized via soap free emulsion polymerization, containing poly-N-isopropyl acrylamide and acrylic acid. The proposed thiol group was then introduced via carbodiimide mediated imide bond between the carboxyl group of carboxyl functionalized microgels and the amine from amino-ethanethiol. The Copper, Palladium and Copper@Palladium nano-particles were mixed-up into thiol-functionalized Poly-N-isopropylacrylamide microgels through metals thiol linkage. The hybrid metallic nano-particles were characterized using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) & Fourier Transfer Infra-Red (FT-IR) for rectification. The experimentation protocol for methyl esters synthesis using various concentrations of hybrid metallic nano-particles in conversion was adjusted to 1:6 oil to methanol molar ratio, temperature 60 °C and reaction time 2 h and stirring 600 rpm, respectively. The optimum yield of methyl esters was reported 92.20 against 1.5gm PNIPAM-Cu@Pd nano-particle. The chemical and structural status of synthesized methyl esters were characterized by Gas Chromatography & Mass Spectroscopy (GC&MS), FT-IR & Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) NMR spectroscopes. The physico-chemical properties of peelu crop methyl esters were analyzed, checked and compared with the international American Standards for Testing Materials (ASTM) & European Union (EN) standards, accordingly. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

Meanwhile, a neural network (NN) is used to minimize bulk density at different combinations of operating conditions to show the accurate and reliable model of NN (R2 = 0.9994). The biochar produced from SCGs torrefied at temperatures of 200–300 °C, duration of 30–60 min, and H2O2 concentrations of 0–100 wt% is examined. The results reveal that the higher heating value (HHV) of biochar increases with rising temperature, duration, or H2O2 concentration, whereas the bulk density has an opposite trend. The HHV, ignition temperature, and bulk density of biochar from torrefaction at 230 °C for 30 min with a 100 wt% H2O2 solution (230-100%-TSCG) are 27.00 MJ∙kg−1, 292 °C, and 120 kg∙m−3, respectively. This HHV accounts for a 29% improvement compared to that of untorrefied SCG. The contact angle (126°), water activity (0.51 aw), and moisture content (7.69%) of the optimized biochar indicate that it has higher resistance against biodegradation, and thereby can be stored longer. Overall, H2O2 is a green treatment additive for SCGs solid fuel. This study has successfully produced biochar with greater HHV and low bulk density at low temperatures. The green additive development can effectively reduce environmental pollutants and upgrade wastes into resources, and achieve “3E”, namely, environmental (non-polluting green additives), energy (biofuel), and circular economy (waste upgrade). In addition, the produced biochar has great potential in the fields of bioadsorbents and soil amendments. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Designing highly active non-noble metal catalysts for the hydrodeoxygenation of renewable biomass into value added biofuels and chemicals is highly desirable, but still remains a challenging task. In this work, flower-like Ni catalysts supported on mixed metal oxides (MMO) were fabricated by calcination and reduction of NiZnAl layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursors. The optimized Ni0.5Zn1.5Al1-MMO catalyst displayed excellent hydrodeoxygenation catalytic activity for lignin derivatives at 130 °C, being much superior with the catalysts prepared by impregnation and coprecipitation method, as well as most of the reported non-noble catalysts. The superior activity originated from the synergetic effect of large specific surface area of the support, strong metal-support interaction and more acid sites. This research provides a feasible route for the constructing efficient hydrodeoxygenation catalysts by tuning the physicochemical property and composition of the catalyst. © 2021

AB  - Paper sludge is a solid waste by-product abundantly produced in the paper industry and contains fine minerals and lignocellulosic biomass. In this contribution, the ex-situ catalytic fast pyrolysis of paper sludge with a high mineral content of ca. 71 wt% is reported for the first time and demonstrated in a pilot-scale unit (feeding rate of 11.3 kg h−1) using a granular Na2CO3/γ-Al2O3 catalyst (loading of 650 g) to produce a high-grade bio-oil at a fast pyrolysis temperature of 475 ± 5 °C (pre-screened using a pyroprobe) and a catalytic upgrading temperature of 500 °C. Besides, &gt; 99 wt% minerals in the paper sludge could be recovered, including paper fillers such as CaCO3 (major) and talc. The bio-oil obtained at a carbon yield of 21 C.% has a low oxygen content of 3.2 wt%, a low total acidity number of 5.2 mg KOH g−1, low H2O content of 0.7 wt%, and a high higher heating value of 40.9 MJ kg−1. It consists of value-added bio-based chemicals such as paraffins, olefins, and low molecular weight aromatics. The results demonstrate that the use of paper sludge to recover minerals and to obtain fuels and chemicals using ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis is technically feasible at a pilot plant scale, which will be of importance for the development of future bio-based economy. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Food waste is generated from residential, commercial, institutional, and industrial sources, and is conventionally disposed of in landfills. To nurture the development of a circular economy for food waste, its valorization by technologies that create fuels, power, or products is being investigated. These technologies offer the potential to dispose food waste while generating sustainable resources. While some literature exists on the economics of food waste utilization options, no existing study simultaneously characterizes different facility scales and locations across many food waste pathways. This study develops a series of cost-benefit models that depict the economic favorability of several food waste management pathways by state: landfilling, composting, anaerobic digestion, incineration, and biofuels production via hydrothermal liquefaction. Economic favorability primarily depends on the local tipping (gate) fee charged by the facility; however, additional revenue streams realized from the sale of biofuels, biopower, or bioproducts can reduce this dependence. Local market prices for biofuels, biopower, or bioproducts generated from food waste determine the profitability of technologies that generate these products. The magnitude of these revenue streams depends on local market factors and the economies of scale leveraged for large facilities. Significant spatial variability in these results exists across the United States, driven by the differences in tipping fees, O&M costs (e.g., labor rates), and product market prices. This study supports decision-making by industry, state, and local governments, as well as furthering research in the area of sustainable utilization of food waste. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Porous organic polymers (POPs) represent an emerging class of porous organic materials which mainly comprise organic building blocks that are interconnected via strong covalent bonds, thereby offering highly cross-linked frameworks with rigid structures and specific void spaces for accommodating guest molecules. In the past few years, POPs have garnered colossal research interest as nanoreactors for heterogeneous catalysis (thermal, photochemical, electrochemical, etc.) because of their intriguing characteristic features, such as high thermal and chemical stabilities, adjustable chemical functionalities, large surface areas, and tunable pore size distributions. This feature article provides an overview of existing research relating to diverse POP synthetic approaches (COFs, CTFs, and some amorphous POPs), the possible modification of the functionality of POPs, and their exciting application as next-generation nanoreactors. These POPs are extremely interesting, as they offer the potential for either metal-free or metalated polymer catalysts allowing photocatalytic CO2 reduction to solar-fuel, biofuel upgrades, the conversion of waste cooking oil to bio-oil, and clean H2 production from water, addressing many scientific and technological challenges and providing new opportunities for various specific topics in catalysis. Finally, we emphasize that the integration of various synthetic approaches and the application of POPs as nanoreactors will provide opportunities in the near future for the precision synthesis of functional materials with significant impact in both basic and applied research areas.

AB  - Bio-oils are multicomponent heterogeneous systems with different origins and prehistory, which implies that they have a complex rheological and thermophysical behavior. The high viscosity of bio-oils is the reason for their special treatment, including hydrogenation, which affects the structure, properties, and, accordingly, the possibility of using the resulting products as liquid fuels. This makes it important to understand the relationship between the structural features of bio-oils and their rheology. In this study, the rheological behavior of four samples of original and hydrogenated bio-oils was studied in a wide temperature range from -30 °C to 70 °C. Bio-oil samples exhibited viscoelasticity and were characterized by the presence of a yield stress, the value of which depended on the content of the dispersed phase in the bio-oil and the type of continuous medium. From a morphological point of view, the original bio-oils represented water-in-oil emulsions, while the hydrogenated samples were oil-in-water ones. According to differential scanning calorimetry data, bio-oils tended to undergo significant supercooling and did not exhibit phase transitions when cooled to at least -50 °C. Arrhenius activation energies can be used to express the tendency of bio-oils to undergo viscosity increase and structure formation (leading to the appearance of a yield stress) with varying the temperature. It was shown that hydrogenated bio-oils have a lower yield stress and apparent viscosity measured at high shear stresses. The complex rheological behavior of bio-oils makes it incorrect to characterize them by a single viscosity value, since it depends not only on the phase composition of the bio-oil, but also on the measuring conditions, which must be tailored individually, taking into account future bio-oil applications. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Waste cooking oil (WCO) is considered as one of the hazardous wastes because improper disposal of WCO can cause significant environmental problems such as blockages of drains and sewers as well as water or soil pollution. In this review, the physical and chemical properties of WCO are evaluated along with its regulations and policies in different countries to promote WCO refined biofuels. Blended WCO can be an auxiliary fuel for municipal solid waste incinerators while the heat produced is able to form superheated steam and subsequently generate electricity via combined heat and power system. Also, WCO contains high ratio of hydrogen atoms compared to carbon and oxygen atoms, making it able to be catalytically cracked, synthesizing hydrogen gas. WCO-based biodiesel has been traditionally produced by transesterification in order to substitute petroleum-based diesel which has non-degradability as well as non-renewable features. Hence, the potentials of hazardous WCO as a green alternative energy source for electricity generation, hydrogen gas as well as biofuels production (e.g. biodiesel, biogas, biojet fuel) are critically discussed due to its attractive psychochemical properties as well as its economic feasibility. Challenges of the WCO utilization as a source of energy are also reported while highlighting its future prospects. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The works focus on maximizing the efficiency and reducing the wastage of reactant to make the possibility of upscaling in the bio-fuel production process for maximum yield conditions. Bio-oil derived from the Citrullus lanatus (Watermelon) for synthesizing methyl ester was used as a feedstock. The value of 1.13 mg KOH/g FFA content is recorded in the oil by employing the titration technique. Henceforth, transesterification using base catalyst reaction was allowed to transform watermelon seed oil into methyl ester. The experimental variables like methanol to oil molar ratio, KOH, and time remained for optimization based on the Taguchi technique. The outcome of the work was a 6:1 M ratio, 1 wt% KOH, 150 min and 55 °C are optimal experimental conditions for maximum conversion efficiency of 93.2%. Amid the four entities, the molar ratio was identified as the substantial influencing variable. The EN14214 standards were compared with characteristics of watermelon methyl ester, and the values obtained have fulfilled the requirements. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Lipid fraction from Monoraphidium sp. to obtain aromatic compounds by catalytic flash pyrolysis using HZSM-5 was studied in this work. Oil extraction has been performed by Schmid-Bondzynski-Ratzlaff, flash pyrolysis was carried out at 500 °C in an analytical micropyrolyzer and the pyrolysis vapors were transported to a fixed catalytic bed heated to 300 °C. According to the results, in the pyrolysis of the lipid extract, most of the renewable aliphatic hydrocarbons obtained were from the range of fuels such as gasoline and kerosene. A formation of about 11% of aromatic compounds was also obtained by non-catalytic pyrolysis due to the large amount of unsaturated fatty acids present in this lipid fraction (60.13%). The HZSM-5 presented high deoxygenation activity, producing 73% of monoaromatics and 12% of hydrocarbons in C4–C11 range. The products identified are useful in different segments of the chemical industry, and can also be used as aromatics additives in advanced fuels. © 2021

AB  - Adequate water-removal techniques are requisite to remain superior biofuel quality. The effects of vibrating types and operating time on the water-removal efficiency of molecular sieves were experimentally studied. Molecular sieves of 3 Å pore size own excellent hydrophilic characteristics and hardly absorb molecules other than water. Molecular sieves of 3 Å accompanied by two different vibrating types, rotary shaking and electromagnetic stirring, were used to remove initial water from the reactant mixture of feedstock oil in order to prevent excessive growth or breeding of microorganisms in the biofuel product. The physical structure of about 66% molecular sieves was significantly damaged due to shattered collision between the magnetic bar and molecular sieves during electromagnetic stirring for 1 h. The molecular sieves vibrated by the rotary shaker appeared to have relatively higher water-removal efficiency than those by the electromagnetic stirrer and by keeping the reactant mixture motionless by 6 and 5 wt.%, respectively. The structure of the molecular sieves vibrated by an electromagnetic stirrer and thereafter being dehydrated appeared much more irregular and damaged, and the weight loss accounted for as high as 19 wt.%. In contrast, the structure of the molecular sieves vibrated by a rotary shaker almost remained original ball-shaped, and the weight loss was much less after regenerative treatment for those molecular sieves. As a consequence, the water-removal process using molecular sieves vibrated by the rotary shaker is considered a competitive method during the biofuel production reaction to achieve a superior quality of biofuels. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The production of biodiesel from waste activated sludge by the in-situ transesterification of its lipid content is studied in this work, comparing both basic and acidic catalytic routes. The acid mechanism is chosen as the optimum one, considering that the high percentage of free fatty acids strongly limits the yields obtained by the basic route, due to the saponification competence. Different pre-treatments are proposed (sonication, microwaves, sieving) to enhance the extraction rate, identified as the limiting step of the process. Sludge drying requirements are also analysed, concluding that water contents below 20% (weight base) does not lead to significant decreases in the transesterification activity. The acidic reaction is also chosen once the quality of the final mixture as alternative biofuel is analysed. Almost all the biodiesel properties (higher heat value, iodine number, kinematic viscosity, density, and long-chain saturated factor and cetane number) are in the optimum ranges proposed by the international normative, concluding that pretreatments do not damage the final product. Optimum results were obtained applying microwaves, with a final yield of 46.7% of FAMEs, which is a clear improvement on the previous literature of biodiesel obtaining from sewage sludge. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Hydrogen (H2) and bio-oil production from renewable sources are promising technologies in the energy sector. Particularly, the use of microalgae as a biomass source in the catalytic pyrolysis process in a hydrogen atmosphere is an encouraging approach in the production of high-quality bio-oil. This study combines two forms of harnessing renewable energy: (1) production of H2 through alkaline electrolysis with sunlight as the energy source, and (2) the production of bio-oil through catalytic hydropyrolysis of microalgae using solar energy as a thermal source in biomass degradation. The effects of catalyst (hydrotalcite precursor) percentage (C) and reaction time (t) on the product distribution and bio-oil content are analyzed. An average bio-oil yield of 45.77% is achieved using ex situ catalytic solar hydropyrolysis, which reaches up to 48.83% under optimal experimental conditions. The hydrogen atmosphere contributes to reducing oxygenated compounds and using a catalyst reduces nitrogenous compounds and raises the hydrocarbon level in the liquid fraction. The bio-oil composition is found to reach 37% of hydrocarbons. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Advanced biofuels produced from lignocellulosic crops grown on marginal lands can become an important part of the European Union (EU) climate change mitigation strategy to reduce CO2 emissions and meet biofuel demand. This study quantifies spatially explicit the availability of marginal land in the EU, its production biomass potentials for eight different crops, and the greenhouse gas (GHG) performance of advanced biofuel supply chains. Available land is mapped based on land marginality and Renewable Energy Directive Recast (REDII) land-related sustainability criteria. Biomass potentials are assessed with a water-use-to-biomass-production approach while considering the available land, location-specific biophysical conditions and crop-specific phenological characteristics. The GHG balance of advanced biofuels from energy crops produced on marginal lands is assessed considering both land-related carbon stock changes and supply chain emissions with the carbon footprint approach from the REDII. Available marginal land that meets REDII criteria is projected at 20.5–21 Mha 2030 and 2050, respectively. Due to biophysical limitations, not all available land is suitable for energy crop production. The maximum biomass potential of lignocellulosic energy crops (optimal crop choice with maximum yield for each available location) varies between 1951 PJ year−1 in 2030 and 2265 PJ year−1 in 2050. The GHG emission performance (net emissions) of different advanced biofuel supply chains varies on average between −32 g CO2-eq MJfuel−1 for poplar/willow diesel to 38 g CO2-eq (Formula presented.) for reed canary grass renewable jet fuel. The large variability in GHG performance is strongly determined by the spatial heterogeneity, which dictates the type of feedstock produced under specific local biophysical conditions, the crop characteristics, and the best conversion pathway. Negative GHG emissions are related to increased carbon stocks for the biomass and soil organic carbon pools compared to the land prior to conversion. When for each location, the advanced biofuel supply chain with the highest GHG performance (lowest net GHG emissions) is selected, 618 PJ year−1 of advanced biofuels can be produced by 2030. Under REDII GHG emission criteria, slightly less (552 PJ year−1) is viable. Smart choices on location, crop type and supply chain design are paramount to achieve maximum benefits of bioenergy systems. © 2021 The Authors. GCB Bioenergy published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Wastewater containg proteinaceous ossein effluents are problematic to be treated. We studied the possibility to treat ossein effluents with the marine cyanobacterium strain Cylindrospermum stagnale. After optimizing the culture conditions of the bacterium, three different types of ossein effluents were tested: dicalcium phosphate (DCP), high total dissolved solids (HTDS) and low total dissolved (LTDS). The effluents were diluted with sea water at the following ratios 1:1, 2:1 and 3:2. The optimum operating conditions were at 3000 lux light intensity and 37 °C temperature. The highest degradation of ossein effluens by C. stagnale was attained for a dilution ratio of 1:1. However, less diluted ossein effluents reduced the growth of C. stagnale drastically. The degradation was shown by measuring the chlorophyll a content and the dry weight of bacterial cells during a seven-day incubation period degradation. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis verified the degradation showing the presence of the degradation products of ossein (i.e. calcium carbonate and calcite) in the culture medium. Lipid composition in fatty acids appeared to be suitable for biofuel production. The results showed that the marine cyanobacterium C. stagnale can be used to treat ossein effluents, and at the same time, to produce biofuel in a sustainable way. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present study, seaweed char-based catalyst was used for pyrolysis of waste clay oil to obtain high-grade biofuels. First, the biochar was activated at different temperatures of 600, 700, and 800 °C (Y600, Y700, and Y800, respectively). The specific surface area of seaweed char prepared by activation at 800 °C reached the maximum value (1227.74 m2/g), which was a good catalyst carrier. Then modified by Cu loading. Results showed that the seaweed carbon-based catalyst has a good decarboxylation effect. The obtained liquid product under catalytic pyrolysis showed the maximum heating value of 48402 kJ/kg by using 15% Cu/Y800 as a catalyst at feed/catalyst ratio of 10:1; with the highest hydrocarbon content, the content of long-chain hydrocarbons and aromatic hydrocarbons being 45.95% and 41.45%, respectively. The decarboxylation effect of Cu-modified seaweed char was obvious, and the copper particles distributed on the seaweed char form active sites, which effectively reformed the pyrolysis volatiles and promotes the production of hydrocarbons, especially aromatic hydrocarbons Therefore, the modified seaweed char-based catalyst has a certain aromatization effect. At the same time, the hydrogen content in the gas-phase product decreased significantly, which may be due to the hydrogenation reaction under the action of catalysis. © 2021

AB  - This work explores palm oil and the residual biomass from oil palm extraction to obtain valuable products via sustainable routes in integrated biorefineries, which were separated into three scenarios: Baseline Scenario is the current Brazilian application of palm in the energy sector using a biodiesel plant with a cogeneration system; Scenario 1 integrates a Hydrotreatment of Esters and Fatty Acids unit to produce bio-jet fuel into the previous case; and Scenario 2, integrates a second-generation ethanol plant and an Alcohol-to-Jet process in order to obtain bio-jet fuel from the second generation. Taking into account that the selection and integration of processes carried out in a biorefinery would impact the overall efficiency of the system, the production costs and the impacts on the environment of the plant make it is necessary to carry out a comprehensive evaluation of the system that allows characterizing and quantify the energy, economic and environmental aspects related to the biomass energy conversion. A methodology of analysis was proposed to address all of these aspects and to provide results that allow for a decision-making guide in technology selection. It was identified that the main need for improvement in the biorefineries relies on cogeneration, which exergy destruction rate ranged from 167.99 to 213.63 MW. The unit exergoeconomic costs founded for glycerol, biodiesel, and electricity were all lower than the market costs, the bio-jet fuel costs, from hydrotreatment, were nearly the same as those from the Brazilian market 0.49 and 0.46 USD/L, respectively. However, the costs of upgrading ethanol were the highest found and way higher than the market rate at 5.15 USD/L. Environmentally, the selected configuration of biorefineries provides all produced biofuel environmental gains compared to conventional non-renewable fuels. Biodiesel and bio-jet fuels would avoid emission of 324.65 kgCO2eq/t and 3092.45 kgCO2eq/t, respectively. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Metschnikowia pulcherrima, a non-traditional oleaginous yeast, was investigated using 0.5–20 g/L of acetic, propionic, butyric and valeric acid (four model products of anaerobic acidification) respectively as carbon sources to accumulate microbial lipids so as to produce biodiesel. The results showed that acetic acid was the most efficient carbon source for improving cell growth, lipid content and biodiesel quality. After 8 cycles non-sterile batch cultivation, M. pulcherrima still dominated in bioreactor. Controlling C/P ratio, K+ and Na+ concentrations, and initial pH could effectively enhance the lipid content to 25.79 ± 0.51%. Under nitrogen starvation, M. pulcherrima performed higher cellular activity and lipid productivity than that of phosphorous limitation. The biomass yield was about twice and the lipid content was 3% higher. Besides, different from the lipid improvement strategy of traditional oleaginous yeast, acetate from ethanol served as the precursor of M. pulcherrima cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA instead of citric acid, and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) was the main donor of reducing equivalent NADPH by transcriptomics sequencing analysis. These results demonstrate M. pulcherrima is a promising species for large-scale production of biofuel from organic wastes due to the low operating and maintenance costs of non-sterile cultivation, which is beneficial for reducing environmental pollution and energy shortages. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Promising bifunctional catalyst systems composed of platinum and polyoxometalates (POMs) were applied successfully for the selective catalytic hydrogenation of 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) to 2-hexanol under mild conditions. Pt(acac)2 was found to be the most active Pt precursor for the ring opening of DMF, and the Keggin-type POM K3[PW12O40] was identified as the most promoting acidic support for 2-hexanol formation at 80 °C and 10 bar H2 pressure using n-decane as a carrier liquid. It was revealed that modifications in the synthetic procedure of the Pt/K3[PW12O40] catalytic system allowed its catalytic performance to be enhanced. Thus, a higher yield of 2-hexanol (72.5%) was achieved compared to that (49%) obtained using a commercial Pt/C catalyst with the same Pt loading. The Wells–Dawson-type POM containing catalyst Pt/K6[α-P2W18O62] was found to be selective for 2-hexanon formation (56.4% yield) under identical reaction conditions. Furthermore, furan and 2-methylfuran were also selectively hydrogenated to 1-butanol (59.7% yield) and 1/2-pentanol (44.3% yield), respectively, under the applied reaction conditions. Moreover, using analytical tools like N2-physisorption, NH3-TPD, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), CO chemisorption, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), revealed that the higher total acid site density of the K3[PW12O40] enhances C=O hydrogenation and overcomes the rate-limiting step of 2-hexanone hydrogenation to 2-hexanol. This demonstrates the high performance of the bi-functional catalyst system Pt/K3[PW12O40] towards ring opening of various furans and the very high selectivity towards alcohol formation. This approach opens new interesting valorization pathways for several furanic compounds with respect to sustainable alcohol formation. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - The present study addresses the significant utility of Used Palm oil Methyl Ester (UPOME) and enhancing the capabilities by adding butyl ferulate. This phenolic antioxidant ester was synthesized using Rhizopus nevius lipase immobilised onto cuttlebone. The butyl ferulate synthesis was monitored in RP-HPLC and confirmed via GC-MS. Concurrently, UPOME was prepared using KOH as the catalyst from the used palm oil. The UPOME was fortified with ferulic acid and butyl ferulate, separately at various concentrations and subjected to thermal oxidation at 110 °C. Biodiesel prepared were estimated for oxidative stability by pattern variations deciphered from the excitation-emission matrix profile. Similarly, the induction period (IP) of the prepared biodiesels was analysed in Rancimate. The addition of the butyl ferulate at 600 ppm in UPOME was able to reduce 80% of the hydroperoxide formation whereas the free ferulic acid showed Stokes shift at the same condition and concentration. Comparatively, 3.5 fold escalation in IP was observed in UPOME with 1000 ppm butyl ferulate than the free ferulic acid. Emission characteristics depicted a significant reduction in NOx (4.7%), CO (27.8%), CO2 (8.3%) and Unburned Hydrocarbons (5.7%) when fuelled B20 with 1000 ppm BF in Compression Ignition engine. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To explore the trend of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) during the oxidation process of biodiesel, this study uses gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS) combined with information entropy theory to propose a new method to analyze the effect of FAMEs on the stability of biodiesel (especially with different amounts of unsaturated FAMEs). The induction periods of the main FAMEs in biodiesel were determined by the Rancimat method. The results showed that the longest induction period of methyl stearate was 248 h, while the induction of methyl linoleate was only 0.12 h. Accelerated oxidation of biodiesel, using GC-MS analysis showed that the oxidation trends of FAMEs was different. The oxidation rate of methyl linoleate was the fastest. A mathematical equation was proposed to calculate the trend of FAMEs. The results showed that during the 5 h accelerated an oxidation process, the content of methyl linoleate decreased from 28.35% to 2.10%, while the content of methyl oleate decreased by 18.21%. Using information entropy, the weighting coefficients of FAMEs in the oxidation process of biodiesel were calculated. The weighting coefficient of methyl linoleate was as high as 0.6797. Methyl linoleate was the main reason why biodiesel was easily oxidized. © 2021

AB  - Direct production of biodiesel by both esterification and transesterification of renewable oils with acid value (AV) of 9.6–28.9 mg KOH/g using calcined blast furnace dust is studied. Blast furnace dust calcined at 600–700 °C obviously promotes efficient biodiesel production because of the crystal form transformation from lead sulfate particles in dust into active lead oxide, lead sulfide, and lead particles. It is found for the first time that lead oxide, lead sulfide and lead particles can resist saponification from fatty acids to catalyze raw renewable oils to biodiesel with catalytic activity order as follows: lead oxide > lead > lead sulfide > lead sulfate. Biodiesel production process is optimized according to an orthogonal design with biodiesel yield of 92 wt% obtained at AV of 9.6 mg KOH/g (82 wt% after 5 cycles). Biodiesel yield of 84 wt% is achieved at AV of 28.9 mg KOH/g with acidity of 0.18 mmol/g. Calcined blast furnace dust presents potential applications in the production of biodiesel from renewable oils with high AVs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work reported the one-pot synthesis of the promising, cheap and green heterogeneous nanocatalyst for biodiesel production. The halloysite nanotube (HNT) was impregnated with 40 wt% NaAlO2 (SA) and the assistance of ultrasonic helped to achieve a better and more stable modification. The resulting 0.4SA/HNTs-UI catalyst was applied in catalyzing the transesterification of palm oil with methanol, using a GA_BP neural network to train and predict the optimal values of reaction parameters. The test results proved the prediction accuracy of the model with R2 = 0.989. The catalyst possessed excellent performance, and the maximum biodiesel yield of 99.15% was achieved with the catalyst loaded amount of 8.82 wt%, methanol to oil molar ratio of 16.79 and transesterification temperature of 65.12 °C. Besides, the physicochemical properties of the purified transesterification product were in accordance with the ASTM D 6751 standard of biodiesel. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is an effective conversion technology of microalgae biomass. In this study, the low-lipid microalgae-spirulina platensis was used as feedstock to investigate the performance of the biochar-based catalysts on HTL. The by-product of spirulina platensis HTL-solid residue was collected and activated to obtain the biochar (BC). Then, the BC was used as the carrier to support Co, Ni and their oxides CoOx and NiO to form Co/BC, Ni/BC, CoOx/BC, NiO/BC catalysts. The Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the HTL parameters and investigate the effect of biochar-based catalysts on HTL. The results showed that the maximum yield of bio-oil catalyzed by BC was 35.80 wt% with 304 °C, 34.7 min, and 0.32 g catalyst loading. BC catalyst displayed an improvement of bio-oil yield up to 4.00 wt% at low temperatures (260–280 °C). Ni/BC was the most favorable catalyst for bio-oil production, reaching a maximum value of 36.57 wt% at 280 °C, 35.0 min, and 0.15 g catalyst loading, which increased by 6.40 wt% compared with the non catalytic case. The characterization of bio-oil showed that CoOx/BC and NiO/BC could raise the hydrocarbon content, H/C value, and heat value, while decrease O/C value. Ni/BC had an excellent denitrification effect on bio-oil, the N content was reduced by nearly 2.00 wt% compared with the non catalytic case. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Phytoextraction is currently investigated to effectively remediate soil contaminated by metals and provide highly competitive biomass for energy production. This research aimed to increase arsenic (As) removal from contaminated soil using industrial Cannabis sativa L., a suitable energy crop for biofuel production. Assisted phytoextraction experiments were conducted on a microcosm scale to explore the ability of two friendly treatments, sodium sulphate (SO4) and exogenous cytokinin (CK), in increasing As phytoextraction efficiency. The results showed that the treatments significantly increased As phytoextraction. Cytokinin was the most effective agent for effectively increasing translocation and the amount of As in aerial parts of C. sativa. In fact, the concentration of As in the shoots of CK-treated plants increased by 172% and 44% compared to untreated and SO4-treated plants, respectively. However, the increased As amount accumulated in C. sativa tissues due to the two treatments negatively affected plant growth. Arsenic toxicity caused a significant decrease in aerial C. sativa biomass treated with CK and SO4 of about 32.7% and 29.8% compared to untreated plants, respectively. However, for our research purposes, biomass reduction has been counterbalanced by an increase in As phytoextraction, such as to consider C. sativa and CK an effective combination for the remediation of As-contaminated soils. Considering that C. sativa has the suitable characteristics to provide valuable resources for bioenergy production, our work can help improve the implementation of a sustainable management model for As contaminated areas, such as phytoremediation coupled with bioenergy generation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The key objective of this study was to evaluate and compare, within the concept of integrated biorefining, the potential environmental gains of the life cycle, economic feasibility and energy balance of the production of bioenergetics from palm and sugarcane. In this context, the research model developed in this work involved several assessment techniques; in terms of environmental assessment, the tool used was the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) from the Well-To-Tank perspective, which is based on the LCA “cradle-to-gate” assignment method. The environmental assessment was performed using SimaPro v.8.0.3 software and the impacts were quantified using the IMPACT 2002+ method. On the other hand, energy performance evaluation was based on the 1st law indicators. Likewise, economic feasibility was based on the evaluation of the fixed capital investment index and the estimate of investment costs for the entire integrated system. Two different scenarios were proposed in order to compare and evaluate traditional systems with the integrated biorefinery. The first conversion scenario (baseline scenario) consisted of a traditional palm oil extraction plant in addition to an ethanol and sugar plant, concerning the use of fossil fuels in all stages of production. The second conversion scenario (improved scenario) explored the substitution of fossil energy sources as well as the energy recovery of residual biomass in more efficient energy conversion systems. The results indicated significant reductions of 29.5% and 29.1% in the global warming impact category when the baseline scenario was compared to the improved scenario. Additionally, the improved scenario achieved a reduction of 2.1 g CO2eq MJ−1 (ethanol) and 2.61 g CO2eq MJ−1 (biodiesel). On the other hand, the improved scenario presented better energy rates since it showed an increase of 3.82% in the global efficiency of the system and produced 106.32 kWh more per ton of processed raw material. Finally, when considering the Life Cycle Energy Efficiency, an increase of 83% was observed and in the case of the Renewability Factor showed an increase of 7.12 energy units. Integration is also economically feasible; however, it could be significantly improved through fiscal incentives founded on the reduction of fossil energy use, enhanced conversion yielding, and improvements in conversion technologies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper aims to discuss the influences of the doping of different types of nanoparticles into the bioethanol-diesel fuel blends on the combustion, performance, and emission aspects. In this viewpoint, the tests are performed at a constant engine speed of 2400 rpm under the varying engine loads from 3 to 12 Nm with the gaps of 3 Nm. Test engine is fuelled with conventional diesel fuel (DF), the binary form of 90% diesel fuel and %10 ethanol (DF90E10), and then separately 100 ppm aluminium oxide (Al2O3) nanoparticles (DF90E10 + A100), and 100 ppm titanium oxide (TiO2) nanoparticles (DF90E10 + T100) into DF90E10 test fuel. In the results, DF90E10 increases brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) by 6.25% and drops the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) by 2.1% in comparison to those of conventional DF. However, it is noticed that nanoparticles-doped DF90E10 test fuels are being pulled back the worsened performance results thanks to their higher surface to volume ratio, higher cetane number, higher calorific value, superior thermal properties, catalyst role of the accelerating chemical reactions in combustion proces, and high energy density of nanoparticles. Accordingly, BSFC is dropped by 2.25% and 1.26% whilst BTE is enhanced by 3.48% and 2.94% for DF90E10 + A100 and DF90E10 + T100 test fuels, respectively as compared to those of DF. Thanks to the excess oxygen content of ethanol and oxygen-donating catalyst role of nanoparticles, carbon monoxide (CO) is reduced by 14.29%, 25%, and 21.43%, and hydrocarbon (HC) is reduced by 21.32%, 30.15%, and 26.47% for DF90E10, DF90E10 + A100, and DF90E10 + T100, respectively as compared to those of conventional DF. NOx emission increases by 3.6% for DF90E10, and then nitrogen oxides (NOx) are reduced by 3.02%, and 1.57% for DF90E10 + A100 and DF90E10 + T100 due to the higher thermal conductivity value of nanoparticles and improving engine performance characteristics. On the other hand, the highest in-cylinder pressure (CPmax) and heat release rate (HRRmax) values, and longer ignition delay are generally noticed for the diesel-ethanol binary blend due to the lower cetane number, lower energy density and higher viscosity. In conclusion, this paper is proving that the doping of nanoparticles into the biofuels is presenting very satisfying results in pulling back the worsened engine characteristics arising from using diesel-biofuel binary blends. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In order to reduce cost of biodiesel production there is need to use non-edible oil. Kusum feed oil is non-edible oil, low cost and substantial available for biodiesel production. To improve Kusum biodiesel performance and emission parameters there is need to analyze input variables in more comprehensive way. It is suitable to establish computational models to obtain optimal parameters. The main goal of the paper was to establish and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to determine the impact of blending, fuel injection timing, fuel injection pressure and engine load on brake thermal efficiency, unburnt hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen. It was found that the fuel injection pressure and engine load is the most influential factors on the brake thermal efficiency, unburnt hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen. The results could be useful for optimization of the Kusum biodiesel performance and emission parameters. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A compact kinetic reaction mechanism for simulating the oxidation of the unsaturated furanic fuels including furan, 2-methylfuran (MF2) and 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) is proposed in this work. The mechanism is developed by integrating the major reaction pathways for the three furanic fuel components into a toluene reference fuel reaction mechanism. The sub-mechanism describing the formation and growth of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons up to pyrene is also incorporated so that the prediction of soot formation is enabled. The major reaction pathways for these furanic fuels are derived from the detailed furanic fuel reaction mechanism in the literature via a systematic selection and extraction procedure. An advanced genetic algorithm is applied to automatically optimize the rate parameters for the major furanic fuel reaction pathways. In addition, a simplified empirical soot model is embedded in the mechanism for simulating the soot formation process in the oxidation of the furanic fuels. The resulting mechanism, consisting of 145 species and 643 reactions, has been evaluated against the ignition delays, speciation profiles, laminar flame speeds as well as the soot mass measured from the combustion of the furanic fuels in the literature. The simulation results in general match satisfactorily well with the experimental data, suggesting the high performance of the proposed mechanism. The performance of the reaction mechanism for engine combustion simulation is also tested. A four-cylinder compression ignition engine is simulated using a coupled KIVA4-CHEMKIN code package. The influences of DMF on the engine combustion characteristics and soot emissions are investigated. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The pyrolysis of di-n-propyl ether (DPE), a potential biofuel candidate, was studied under a temperature range of 850–1350 K in a flow reactor at low and atmospheric pressures. Synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry was used for isomeric identification and mole fraction measurements of the pyrolysis products, especially the free radicals. Specific products were observed and measured for the unimolecular decomposition reactions of DPE. A detailed kinetic model of DPE pyrolysis was developed based on the n-propanol combustion model. Modeling analyses including the rate of production (ROP) and sensitivity analyses were performed to reveal the consumption pathways of DPE, as well as the formation and consumption pathways of intermediates and products. ROP and sensitivity analyses indicated that the consumption reaction of DPE was mainly controlled by the unimolecular decomposition reactions and H-abstractions at both low and atmospheric pressures. The pericyclic reaction, leading to n-propanol + propylene, was the most important unimolecular decomposition reactions, especially at low pressure. The H-abstraction reactions of DPE played crucial roles in its consumption. Further β-C–C and β-C–O scission reactions of the three primary radicals can produce some oxygenated and hydrocarbon products. Relatively high mole fractions of C1–C3 aldehydes and C1–C3 alkane, alkene, and alkyl radicals were observed, which demonstrated the structural feature of DPE. Comparison of the product distribution between DPE and n-propanol were also analyzed. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass such as switchgrass can be converted to n-butanol using fermentation, which can be further processed into jet fuel. Traditional acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation only converts sugars derived from switchgrass to ABE. Novel co-fermentation processes convert sugars and gas (CO2/H2) produced during fermentation into butanol, thus increasing ABE yields by 15.5% compared to traditional ABE fermentation. Herein, the environmental impact of a Switchgrass to Jet Fuel (STJ) pathway was assessed using life cycle assessment (LCA) from well-to-wake. LCAs were performed for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from jet fuel production via co-fermentation of sugars and gas for ideal and practical cases of ABE fermentation and seven other jet fuel pathways. The ideal case assumes 100% sugar recovery and 95% ABE yield. The practical case assumes 90% sugar recovery and an 80% ABE yield. Results are presented based on 100-year global warming potential (GWP) per MJ of jet fuel. Co-products were allocated using various methods. The increase in butanol yield via the co-fermentation technology reduced GWP-100 for the STJ pathway by 6.5% compared to traditional ABE fermentation. Similarly, the STJ pathway for the practical case with co-fermentation had 14.2%, 47.5%, 73.8%, and 44.4% less GWP-100 compared to HRJ, Fischer-Tropsch jet fuel from switchgrass, Fischer-Tropsch jet fuel from coal, and conventional petroleum jet fuel. The results demonstrate that the STJ pathway via co-fermentation has the potential to increase product yield while reducing GHG emissions compared to other jet fuel production pathways. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Co-hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of wastewater algae and crude glycerol has been shown to produce higher yields at lower costs compared to wastewater algae biomass conversion alone. The biocrude oil produced from co-HTL of wastewater algae and crude glycerol does, however, have a relatively high oxygen content (10-16 wt %) and relatively low energy content (34-36 MJ/kg). To upgrade the biocrude oil to high-quality biofuel and to simplify the overall process, several organic solvents were evaluated for their ability to extract biocrude oil from the HTL products and to donate hydrogen for biocrude oil upgrading. The solvent options tested were hexane, cyclohexane, ethyl acetate, and no solvent, in combination with effective heterogeneous upgrading catalysts: H-beta zeolite, Pt/C, and Raney Ni. Biocrude oil yields varied with the polarity of solvent; as expected, solvents with high polarity led to more extraction of biocrude oil albeit with lower quality. Pt/C was the most effective catalyst for upgrading, producing a light-colored, low-viscosity liquid with lower oxygen content (0.01 wt %) and higher energy content (44 MJ/kg). The choice of solvent had relatively little effect on upgrading outcomes compared to the selection of the catalyst. The no solvent with Pt/C and the ethyl acetate with Pt/C combinations were the most promising, resulting in an upgraded oil energy content similar to gasoline and a near complete removal of oxygen. The combination of ethyl acetate and Pt/C resulted in a higher energy recovery. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Furanic ethers including furfuryl ether (FE) and tetrahydrofurfuryl ether (TFE) are considered as boosters for raising the octane number and cetane number, respectively. In this work, heterogeneous catalysts are used to synthesize FE from furfuryl alcohol and are found to be effective, and then they hydrogenate FE into TFE. Among the solid acids including HZSM-5, SiO2-Al2O3, SiO2, and Al2O3, it was discovered that the SiO2-Al2O3 complex with about 2.0% Al2O3 content exhibited excellent activity with 69% ethyl furfuryl ether (EFE) yield achieved. SiO2-Al2O3 demonstrated a decrease in its activity after being recycled six times. However, after calcination, SiO2-Al2O3 regained its activity. SiO2-Al2O3 maintained its activity and stability due to the Lewis acid site and the large pore size. In situ hydrogenation of EFE into ethyl tetrahydrofuran ether was performed using Ru/C, Pd/C, Pd/Al2O3, Raney Ni, Ni/Al2O3, Ni/CeO2, and Ni/SiO2 catalysts. Only Raney Ni demonstrated both high activity and stability. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biofuel usage has good environmental and economic benefits but at the same time it has weak performance and fuel efficient when compared to usage jet fuel in aircraft similarly release of sulphur particles will end solar radiation. In additionally to these barriers, flame speed of biofuel is very low compared to jet fuel flame speed so a new task is arrived here that is flame stabilization in combustion chambers while using blended biofuel with jet fuel. Hence, we are analysing aircraft turbofan engine combustion chambers both by theoretical and analytical manner about its working when using blended biofuel. Using NASA CEA online software, the combustor data are gathered and are compared with analysis of designed combustor in ANSYS analysis software. The flame analysis is more important when using the blended biofuel in different ratio. © 2021. MechAero Foundation for Technical Research & Education Excellence.

AB  - The oils extracted from the waste plastic can be an admirable alternate for the compression ignition engines nevertheless they capitulate upper smoke emissions along with deprived performance when compared with diesel. The extraction of waste plastic oil (WPO) is attained through pyrolysis. The impact of accumulating a constituent hexanol (H), a biologically available biofuel is assessed. Three ternary mixtures, DE50%-WPO40%-H10%, DE50%-WPO30%-H20% and DE50%-WPO20%-H30% has been deliberately primed for utilizing mutually a cast-off element (WPO maximum of 40%) along with a non-conventional part (hexanol maximum of 30%). The performance characteristics and emission factors of C.I engine fuelled with the above mix were assessed. The output specifies that hexanol inclusion makes significant reduction in smoke emission in addition to privileged HC emission in contrast to diesel. Inclusion of 10% hexanol in volume with WPO and diesel mixture retards the NOx emission considerably whilst match up to WPO as well as diesel individually. In spite of this, NOx emission is superior than the subsequent WPO with increased degree of hexanol converges. Brake thermal efficiency of the engine increases by way of escalating the hexanol portion in the blend while comparing with WPO. The fuel spending of concoction has been established to be reduced while compared to WPO. DE50%-WPO40%-H10% concoction showed a reduced amount of NOx as well as smoke emission. © 2021.

AB  - The fuel qualities of several biodiesels containing highly saturated, mono, and poly unsaturated fatty acids, as well as their combustion and exhaust emission characteristics, were studied. Six biodiesel samples were divided into two groups based on their fatty acid composition, including group 1 (coconut, castor, and jatropha) and group II (palm, karanja, and waste cooking oil biodiesel). All fuels (in both groups) were tested in a single-cylinder off-road diesel engine. Castor and karanja biodiesel, both rich in mono-unsaturation level, have a high viscosity of about 14.5 and 5.04 mm2/s, respectively. The coconut and palm biodiesels are rich in saturation level with cetane numbers of 62 and 60, respectively. In both groups, highly saturated and poly-unsaturated methyl esters presented better combustion efficiency and less formation of polluted emissions than mono-unsaturation. At full load, coconut and palm biodiesel displayed 38% and 10% advanced start of combustion, respectively, which reduced ignition delay by approximately 10% and 3%, respectively. Mono-unsaturated methyl esters exhibited a higher cylinder pressure and heat release rate, which results in higher NOx gas emissions. The group II biodiesels showed about 10–15% lower exhaust emissions owing to an optimum level of fatty acid composition. Our study concluded that highly saturated and poly-unsaturated fatty acid performed better than mono-unsaturated biodiesels for off-road engine application. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The use of biofuels for spark ignition engines is proposed to diversify fuel sources and reduce fossil fuel consumption, optimize engine performance, and reduce pollutant emissions. Additionally, when these biofuels are produced from low-grade wastes, they constitute valorisation pathways for these otherwise unprofitable wastes. In this study, ethanol and pyrolysis biogasoline made from low-grade wastes were evaluated as additives for commercial gasoline (RON95, RON98) in tests performed in a spark ignition engine. Binary fuel mixtures of ethanol + gasoline or biogasoline + gasoline with biofuel incorporation of 2% (w/w) to 10% (w/w) were evaluated and compared with ternary fuel mixtures of ethanol + biogasoline + gasoline with biofuel incorporation rates from 1% (w/w) to 5% (w/w). The fuel mix performance was assessed by determination of torque and power, fuel consumption and efficiency, and emissions (HC, CO, and NOx). An electronic control unit (ECU) was used to regulate the air–fuel ratio/lambda and the ignition advance for maximum brake torque (MBT), wide-open throttle (WOT)), and two torque loads for different engine speeds representative of typical driving. The additive incorporation up to 10% often improved efficiency and lowered emissions such as CO and HC relative to both straight gasolines, but NOx increased with the addition of a blend. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Renewable energies are cleaner forms of energy, and their use, has intensified in recent decades. Thus, this work presents a proposal for reducing the emissions, fuel cost, and respiratory disease hospitalizations using environmental cost accounting principles to produce biodiesel production from waste frying oil. In our methodology, we conducted surveys, and collected waste cooking oil samples from local households and restaurants in São Paulo city, Brazil. Then, we produced biodiesel using these samples. Data on air pollutants were collected and correlated with the number of hospitalizations for respiratory diseases and their costs. Our results indicate that 330,000 respiratory disease hospitalizations were recorded in São Paulo city between 2009 and 2018, and the total cost for the Brazilian government reached US $117 million. Improving the city air quality by switching from fossil fuels to biodiesel could reduce the annual number of hospitalizations to 9880 and cost US $3.518 million, because the amount of pollutants emitted from burning fossil fuels was positively correlated with the number of respiratory disease hospitalizations and their costs. Moreover, the emission rates of particulate matter with particles less than 10 and 2.5 µm in diameter exceeded the World Health Organization limits throughout the study period. Using the survey data, we estimated that the average monthly quantity of waste cooking oil was 9794.6 m3, which could generate 9191.2 m3 of biodiesel and produce 239,713 t CO2 of carbon credits. Environmental cost accounting revealed that it would be possible to achieve an annual profit of approximately US $300 million from the sale of excess biodiesel, carbon credits, and glycerine, and fuel acquisition savings which could improve the image of São Paulo city and quality of life of its residents. Thus, we present this as a way to reduce cost and hospitalizations, and increase the number of available hospital beds for other diseases, such as COVID-19. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Gas engine-driven heat pumps are an interesting option to satisfy space heating and cooling demands aiming at energy saving, environmental impact and operating costs’ reduction. This work presents (i) a comprehensive review updated on gas engine-driven heat pumps research activities, (ii) the investigation of the central role of this technology in the air conditioning sector and (iii) the future perspectives regarding gas engine heat pumps’ diffusion in the context of the energy sector decarbonisation. The outcomes highlight that gas engine heat pumps could have better environmental performance compared to electric heat pumps both in heating and cooling operations. Moreover, they could play a pivotal role in the fight against climate change and energy security since they can guarantee an energy mix differentiation moving from electricity to natural gas and renewable gases’ usage. Indeed, by 2030, a lower-carbon gas grid could be supported by renewable gases. A further investigation has concerned diffusion of gas heat pumps activated from biofuels produced by local biomass in an energy community scenario based on a low-temperature energy district network. A novel biomass-based GEHP interacting with a low-temperature district heating network is proposed here. This system could save more than 30% of primary energy compared to biomass-fuelled boilers. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The present study aims to improve biomass and biochemical constituents, especially lipid production of Anabaena variabilis and Nostoc muscorum by formulating an optimal growth condition using various concentrations of nutrients (NO3−, PO43− and CO32−) for biodiesel production. The sup-plementation of the three nutrients by +50% showed the maximum dry weight and biomass produc-tivity, while the macromolecule contents were varied. The depletion of N-NO3− by 50% N-NO3− showed the maximum lipid yield (146.67 mg L−1) in A. variabilis and the maximum carbohydrate contents (285.33 mg L−1) in N. muscorum with an increase of 35% and 30% over control of the syn-thetic medium, respectively. However, variation in P-PO43− and C-CO32− showed insignificant improving results for all biochemical compositions in both cyanobacteria. A. variabilis was the superior species for lipid and protein accumulation; however, N. muscorum showed the maximum carbohydrate content. Accordingly, A. variabilis was selected for biodiesel production. In A. variabilis, −50% N-NO3− resulted in 35% higher lipid productivity compared to the control. Furthermore, the fatty acid profile and biodiesel quality-related parameters have improved under this condition. This study has revealed the strategies to improve A. variabilis lipid productivity for biodiesel production for small-scale in vitro application in terms of fuel quality under low nitrate levels. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Low or zero carbon fuels are crucial for maritime transportation decarbonization goals. This paper assesses potential localities for maritime biofuels (biobunkers) production in Brazil, Europe, South Africa, and United States considering geographical, logistic, and economic aspects. This assessment combines georeferenced and techno‐economic analyses to identify suitable fuel production hotspots based on not only plant performance and costs but also on logistic integration and biomass seasonality. Five technology pathways were considered: Straight vegetable Oils (SVO), Hydrotreated Vegetable Oils (HVO), Fischer–Tropsch Biomass‐to‐liquids (FT‐BTL), Alcohol oligomerization to middle distillates (ATD), and Hydrotreated Pyrolysis Oil (HDPO). Findings reveal that biomass concentration in Brazil makes it the region with highest biobunker potential, which are mostly close to coastal areas and surpasses regional demand. Although other regions registered more limited potentials, hotspots proximity to ports would enable fossil fuel replacements in these areas. For all cases, biobunker costs (USD 21–104/GJ) are higher than conventional marine fuels prices (USD 11–17/GJ). Only 15% of the hotspots’ carbon prices that would allow its competitiveness are lower than USD 100/tCO2. Alternatives to incentivize biobunker production would be, first, to establish mandatory fuel blends and second, to join forces with other sectors that would be benefited from the co‐production of advanced biofuels. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - This paper focuses on the investigation and optimisation of the Miller cycle, methanol, ethanol and turbocharging when applied to a high-performance gasoline engine. These technologies have been applied both individually and concurrently to test for potential compounding effects. Improvements have been targeted with regards to both emission output and performance. Also assessed is the capability of the engine to operate when exclusively powered by biofuels. This has been carried out numerically using the 1D gas dynamics tool ‘WAVE’, a 1D Navier–Stokes equation solver. These technologies have been implemented within the McLaren M838T 3.8L twin-turbo engine. The Miller cycle early intake valve close (EIVC) improved peak efficiency by 0.17% and increased power output at low and medium loads by 11%. Reductions of 6% for both NOx and CO were also found at rated speed. The biofuels achieved NOx and CO reductions of 60% and 96% respectively, alongside an efficiency increase of 2.5%. Exclusive biofuel use was found to be feasible with a minimum 35% power penalty. Applied cooperatively, the Miller cycle and biofuels were not detrimental to each other, compounding effects of a further 0.05% efficiency and 2% NOx improvements were achieved. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The maritime transportation sector (MTS) is undertaking a major global effort to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), e.g., sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and the concentration of particulates in suspension. Substantial investment is necessary to develop alternative sustainable fuels, engines, and fuel modifications. The alternative fuels considered in this study include liquified natural gas, nuclear energy, hydrogen, electricity, and biofuels. This paper focuses on biofuels, in particular fast pyrolysis bio-oil (FPBO), a serious partial alternative in MTS. There are some drawbacks, e.g., biofuels usually require land necessary to produce the feedstock and the chemical compatibility of the resulting biofuel with current engines in MTS. The demand for sustainable feedstock production for MTS can be overcome by using cellulose-based and agroforestry residues, which do not compete with food production and can be obtained in large quantities and at a reasonably low cost. The compatibility of biofuels with either bunker fuel or diesel cycle engines can also be solved by upgrading biofuels, adjusting the refining process, or modifying the engine itself. The paper examines the possibilities presented by biofuels, focusing on FPBO in Brazil, for MTS. The key issues investigated include FPBO, production, and end use of feedstocks and the most promising alternatives; thermal conversion technologies; potential applications of FPBO in Brazil; sustainability; biofuels properties; fuels under consideration in MTS, challenges, and opportunities in a rapidly changing maritime fuel sector. Although the focus is on Brazil, the findings of this paper can be replicated in many other parts of the world. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Several countries have set ambitious targets for the transport sector that mandate a gradual increase in advanced biofuel content in the coming years. The current work addresses this transition and indicates two promising gasoline bio-blendstocks: anisole and isobutanol. The whole value chains of these bio-components were considered, focusing on end-use performance, but also analyz-ing feedstock and its conversion, well-to wheel (WTW) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and costs. Three alternative fuels, namely a ternary blend (15% anisole, 15% isobutanol, 70% fossil gasoline on an energy basis) and two binary blends (15% anisole with fossil gasoline and 30% isobutanol with fossil gasoline), were tested, focusing on their drop-in applicability in spark ignition (SI) engines. The formulated liquid fuels performed well and showed the potential to increase brake thermal efficiency (BTE) by 1.4% on average. Measured unburned hydrocarbons (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions were increased on average by 12–29% and 17–51%, respectively. However, HC and CO concentrations and exhaust temperatures were at acceptable levels for proper catalyst operation. The studied blends were estimated to bring 11–22% of WTW GHG emission reductions compared to base gasoline. Additionally, the fleet performance and benefits of flexi-fuel vehicles (FFV) were modeled for ternary blends. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Bioethanol has many environmental and practical benefits as a transportation fuel. It is one of the best alternatives to replace fossil fuels due to its liquid nature, which is similar to the gasoline and diesel fuels traditionally used in transportation. In addition, bioethanol production technology has the capacity for negative carbon emissions, which is vital for solving the current global warming dilemma. However, conventional bioethanol production takes place based on an inland site and relies on freshwater and edible crops (or land suitable for edible crop production) for production, which has led to the food vs. fuel debate. Establishing a coastal marine biorefinery (CMB) system for bioethanol production that is based on coastal sites and relies on marine resources (seawater, marine biomass and marine yeast) could be the ultimate solution. In this paper, we aim to evaluate the environmental impact of using seawater for bioethanol production at coastal locations as a step toward the evaluation of a CMB system. Hence, a life cycle assessment for bioethanol production was conducted using the proposed scenario, named Coastal Seawater, and compared to the conventional scenario, named Inland Freshwater (IF). The impact of each scenario in relation to climate change, water depletion, land use and fossil depletion was studied for comparison. The Coastal Seawater scenario demonstrated an improvement upon the conventional scenario in all the selected impact categories. In particular, the use of seawater in the process had a significant effect on water depletion, showing an impact reduction of 31.2%. Furthermore, reductions were demonstrated in natural land transformation, climate change and fossil depletion of 5.5%, 3.5% and 4.2%, respectively. This indicates the positive impact of using seawater and coastal locations for bioethanol production and encourages research to investigate the CMB system. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - This study focuses on the valorization of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (biopulp) by hydrothermal liquefaction. Thereby, homogeneous alkali catalysts (KOH, NaOH, K2CO3, and Na2CO3) and a residual aqueous phase recirculation methodology were mutually employed to enhance the bio-crude yield and energy efficiency of a sub-critical hydrothermal conversion (350 °C, 15–20 Mpa, 15 min). Interestingly, single recirculation of the concentrated aqueous phase positively increased the bio-crude yield in all cases, while the higher heating value (HHV) of the bio-crudes slightly dropped. Compared to the non-catalytic experiment, K2CO3 and Na2CO3 effectively increased the bio-crude yield by 14 and 7.3%, respectively. However, KOH and NaOH showed a negative variation in the bio-crude yield. The highest bio-crude yield (37.5 wt.%) and energy recovery (ER) (59.4%) were achieved when K2CO3 and concentrated aqueous phase recirculation were simultaneously applied to the process. The inorganics distribution results obtained by ICP reveal the tendency of the alkali elements to settle into the aqueous phase, which, if recovered, can potentially boost the circularity of the HTL process. Therefore, wise selection of the alkali catalyst along with aqueous phase recirculation assists hydrothermal liquefaction in green biofuel production and environmentally friendly valorization of biopulp. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The aqueous phase reforming (APR) of glycerol was studied using sonochemically synthesized 10%Ni-x%Ca/ZrO2 catalysts (where x = 0, 0.5, 3, and 5) for the production of value-added liquid products. The APR reaction was performed in a batch reactor under the following conditions: 20 bar, 230◦C 450 rpm, and 1 h of reaction time. The synthesized catalysts were characterized using XRD, FESEM, BET, and H2-TPR to observe the effect of Ca doping on the physio-chemical properties of the catalysts. The results revealed that, at higher Ca loading, the catalysts experienced serious particles’ agglomeration, which resulted in a larger particles’ size, smaller surface area, and smaller pore volume owing to uneven distribution of the particles. The characterization results of the catalysts confirmed that the Us catalysts have a slightly higher surface area, pore volume, and pore size, as well as highly reducible and fine crystalline structure, compared with WI catalysts. The catalytic performance of the catalysts shows that 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) and 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PDO) were the two main liquid products produced from this reaction. The highest selectivity of 1,3-PDO (23.84%) was obtained over the 10%Ni/ZrO2 catalyst, while the highest selectivity of 1,2-PDO (25.87%) was obtained over the 10%Ni-5%Ca/ZrO2 catalyst. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Biofuels derived from renewable plant materials are considered promising alternative fuels to decrease emissions of ICEs. This study aimed to justify the possibility of using vegetable oils of different sources as a 10% additive in blended biofuel for diesel engines of agricultural machinery and commercial vehicles. Seven different vegetable oils were investigated. Experiments have been performed by fueling a diesel engine with blended biofuels of 90% petroleum diesel fuel and 10% vegetable oil. In the maximum power and maximum torque modes, the brake power drop was no more than 1.5%, and the brake-specific fuel consumption increase was less than 4.3%; NOx emissions were reduced by up to 8.3%, exhaust smoke—up to 37.5%, CO—up to 20.0%, and unburned HC—up to 27.9%. In the operating modes of the European 13-mode steady-state test cycle, the integral specific emissions of HC decreased by up to 30.0%, integral specific emissions of CO—up to 15.0%, and integral specific emissions of NOx—up to 16.0%. The results obtained show the feasibility and rationality of using the investigated vegetable oils as a 10% additive in blended biofuel for diesel engines of agricultural machinery and commercial vehicles. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The aggressive growth of Eichhornia crassipes (Water Hyacinth) plants causes severe damage to the irrigation, environment, and waterway systems in Iraq. This study aims to produce, characterize, and test biofuel extracted from the Eichhornia crassipes plant in Iraq. The extracted biodiesel was mixed at 10%, 20%, and 40% with neat diesel to produce three biodiesel samples. The methodology consists of the physiochemical properties of the samples that were characterized. The performance of the IC engine fueled by neat and biodiesel samples was measured under various operational conditions. The exhaust gases were analyzed to estimate the compounds to assess the environmental impact. The results showed that the density and viscosity of mixtures increase and the calorific value decrease with biodiesel. The engine test showed that the diesel + 10BE, diesel + 20BE, and diesel + 40BE enhanced brake thermal efficiency using 2.6%, 4.2%, and 6.3%, respectively, compared to neat diesel. Exhaust tests show a slight reduction, of 0.85–3.69% and 2.48–6.93%, in CO and HC emission, respectively. NOx is higher by 1.87–7.83% compared with neat diesel. The results revealed that biodiesel blended from Eichhornia crassipes is a viable solution to mitigate the drastic impact on the environment and economy in Iraq. The blended biodiesel has good potential to be mixed with the locally produced diesel from oil refineries. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The removal of nitrogen (N) and sulphur (S) from biocrude oil produced using hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), is important for the production of high quality renewable fuels. Here the effect of co-liquefaction of bagasse and algae was analysed. Algae (Chlorella vulgaris and Cyanobacteria) were mixed with bagasse (1:1) subjected to HTL at 250–350 °C for 10–60 min. Higher HTL temperatures had a positive effect in increasing the biocrude yield and slightly reduced N content; S did not show a consistent trend. Most of the nitrogen (~66%) and sulphur (~80%) were recovered in the aqueous phase rather than in the biocrude phase, opening the opportunity to recycle these nutrients for algae cultivation. Co-liquefying bagasse with algae improved the biocrude yield (54 wt%) compared to pure Cyanobacteria (47.5 wt%). It also reduced N content from 7 wt% (Cyanobacteria biocrude) to 4.2 wt% (Cyanobacteria: Bagasse) and S from 0.7 wt% to 0.4 wt%. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) analysis identified that biocrude yield is positively correlated with the initial lipid content and anti-correlated with the carbohydrates fraction. Biocrude N content is closely related to the initial amount of proteins in the algae. The Preference Ranking Organization METHod for Enrichment of Evaluations and its descriptive complement Geometrical Analysis for Interactive Aid (PROMETHEE and GAIA) analysis ranked the co-liquefaction of Chlorella vulgaris and bagasse (1:1) at 350 °C and 60 min as one of the best overall combination in terms of biocrude yield, N and S content. © 2021

AB  - In particular, a straw-based Ablative Fast Pyrolysis (AFP) oil was upgraded via hydrotreatment (HDT) in order to be used as a blending component with fossil-based intermediates. The raw pyrolysis oil is characterized by H/C = 0.14, O/C = 0.58 and C = 57.73 wt%, while the HDT pyrolysis oil has a H/C = 0.14, O/C = 0.016 and C = 85.85 wt%. Based on the density, viscosity and composition, and in association with a typical refinery, the possible petroleum refinery entry points for HDT pyrolysis oil include Straight Run Gas-Oil (SRGO), Atmospheric Gas-oil (GO), Fluid Catalytic Cracking Light Cycle Oil (LCO) and Heavy Cycle Oil (HCO), as well as Light Vacuum Gas-Oil (LVGO). To that aim, this work examined raw and HDT bio-oil blends with the aforementioned candidate petroleum streams at a 30:70 v/v ratio (raw or HDT bio-oil/petroleum stream) with respect to their miscibility, by comparing the blend components’ properties, microscopic observation, and interfacial tension analysis. From the microscopic observation, the addition of HDT pyrolysis oil in all examined petroleum candidates renders a homogeneous mixture where the two phases cannot be distinguished. In addition, no interfacial tension was observed in the examined blends, while the blend of HDT pyrolysis oil with the different petroleum streams not only did not deteriorate the fuel characteristics over the original petroleum stream, but also it improved them, in some cases. In general, the HDT pyrolysis oil was found to be miscible with all the examined refinery streams, extending the potential further investigation of stabilized pyrolysis oil integration over oil refineries. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Sustainable production of biofuel and chemical feedstock through catalytic hydrogenation has now received increased attention due to the expeditious depletion of crude oil. In the present investigation, we developed a cost-effective and base metal-based NiCu/Laponite catalyst for liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural into fuel range components. The robust catalysts were prepared by a simple co-impregnation method with constant loading of 5 wt% NiO with different wt.% of CuO (x) loadings (where x = 8, 10, 12 &amp; 14%) on the Laponite support. The textural properties, surface acidity, and reduction of the synthesized catalysts were studied by employing various physicochemical characterizations such as XRD, N2 sorption analysis, NH3-TPD, H2-TPR, and TGA. The obtained results revealed that optimum loading of 12% CuO and 5% NiO catalyst aids fine dispersion of copper and nickel oxide on the surface of the support. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images displayed the delamination of Laponite particles and dispersion of Ni-Cu catalyst on the support surface. The hydrogenation efficiency of the synthesized catalysts was tested in a bench top stainless steel autoclave reactor by liquid phase reaction condition of furfural at 150–210 °C under 10–25 bar H2 pressure for 1–6 h. The excellent activity of 5Ni-12Cu/Laponite catalysts was compared and correlated with the physicochemical characteristics of the catalyst. © 2021 The Society of Powder Technology Japan

AB  - The hydrochar, a by-product of hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of algal biomass, was utilized through two methods; combustion and activation, for its usage as a source of heat and a catalyst support for hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) process in the production of algal biofuels. In this study, techno-economic analysis (TEA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) of algal biofuels production in a two-stage process (HTL and HDO) were investigated. Aspen plus simulation and SimaPro software were used to analyze process economics and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Microalgae at 200 dry metric tonnes day−1 was the basis for its conversion to biocrude oil through HTL in the methanol-water system followed by catalytic upgrading to produce biofuels. According to HTL experimental results, maximum biocrude oil yield of 57.8 wt% was obtained using microalgae-solvent mass ratio and methanol-water mass ratio of 1:5 and 3:1, respectively. Produced biocrude oil contained 14.5 wt% of oxygen and HHV of 33.4 MJ kgbiocrude oil−1 which required upgrading to be utilized as a transportation fuel. HDO was employed to enhance the quality of biocrude oil with decrease in oxygen content (3.1 wt%) and increase in HHV (42 MJ kgbiofuel−1). The minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) for using method #2 (activation) was 2.2 $ L−1 to breakeven the cost of operation, which was about 10% lower than that from method #1 (combustion). The GHG emissions performance was estimated at −1.13 gCO2-eq MJ−1 indicating the significant GHG emissions reduction compared to petroleum-based fuels production. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - While some studies have simultaneously modeled the competitiveness of biochemicals alongside bioenergy and biofuels for greenhouse gas abatement, this has never been done before for Germany. The findings on the potential greenhouse gas abatement from these previous studies cannot be replicated in the German context because of different frame conditions, such as biomass potentials, temporal horizon, climate targets and the evolution of demand from biomass end-use sectors. This, therefore, necessitates a country-specific assessment. In this study we use a bi-objective bottom-up optimization model to quantify the potential greenhouse abatement (i.e. from best compromise solutions between the cost-optimal and technical-optimal objectives) for biomass deployment to the bioenergy, biofuels and biochemical sectors of the German bioeconomy. Results show that, with a reference crude oil price development, biomass potentials (i.e. 300 PJ of forest residues and 2.7 million hectares of arable land) could save 69 million t CO2-eq by 2050, representing a 6% reduction over 1990 GHG emission levels in the energy, building, transport and industrial sectors. The cumulative abatement (i.e. for 2020–2050) of 1.72 billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions was found to be 8.5% higher than when the available biomass resources were exclusively used for bioenergy and biofuels. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - As a result of anthropocentric climate change, there is an urgent need to decarbonize the supply of energy. Organic biomass, referred to as feedstock, can be converted into biofuels that have the potential to decarbonize transport. However, biofuels are typically not carbon neutral because the preparation of feedstocks and the production of biofuels require energy currently supplied by fossil fuels, which involve carbon emissions. This work aimed to bring biofuel research up to date with current UK policy of net zero carbon emissions by examining the volume of carbon-neutral advanced biofuels that could be produced from sustainable feedstocks generated in the UK. By analyzing relevant data, it is estimated that between 667 and 1,791 million litres (Mltr) of carbon-neutral biodiesel equivalent could be produced with the energy content of 22.7-60.9 PJ, corresponding to 8.1%-21.7% of current diesel consumption by heavy goods vehicles in the UK. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - To promote the use of waste-originated resources in biodiesel production, this study proposes the utilization of leather tanning waste (LTW) and crab-shell (CS) waste as the respective lipid source and catalyst material. The obtained CS-based calcium oxide (CaO) has comparable textural properties with those of existing waste-based catalysts and shows high catalytic activity for the conversion of LTW to biodiesel. The optimum yield of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) is predicted at 97.9 wt%, while it is experimentally observed at 98.7 ± 0.4 wt% (purity of 98.6 ± 0.4 wt%) using the following operating condition: reaction time t = 3.58 h, catalyst amount mc = 3.87 wt%, and a molar ratio of ethanol to LTW meo = 12:1. The CS-based CaO shows good reusability with FAEE yield staying above 90 wt% for four cycles. The fuel properties of LTW-based biodiesel meet ASTM D6751 and ASTM D975-08 standards, with the ethyl ester ranging from C14 to C20. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Materials which synergistically combine Lewis and Brønsted acid properties hold potential for applications as efficient heterogeneous catalysts for preparation of biofuels and biolubricants. Herein we report new heterogeneous catalysts based on grafting the intact Lewis metal (ZrIV) substituted Keggin polyoxometalate (POM) on mesoporous silica support. A new approach for immobilization of the POM in MCM-41 silica was developed by co-condensation of Si source (tetraethyl orthosilicate, TEOS) with POM salt in the presence of a template molecule as an alternative to the commonly used acidic POM form and impregnation procedure for catalyst preparation. The proposed synthesis method in combination with extraction of the template proceeded with preservation of the intact POM structure and resulted in hybrid catalysts with in situ generated Brønsted acid sites in addition to the Lewis acidity provided by the metal centers. Textural properties of the catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, N2 physisorption and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Insight into POM stability and structural transformations during synthesis, template removal and impregnation was provided by solid state 31P and 29Si NMR spectroscopy. Catalytic activity was studied in esterification reactions of levulinic acid with ethanol or octanol to value-added esters. The directly synthesized POM-functionalized hybrid catalysts exceeded the post synthesis impregnated ones, demonstrating significantly higher catalytic activity, recyclability and resistance against leaching. The proposed approach for immobilization of Lewis metal POMs in MCM-41 silica framework with in situ generation of the active Brønsted acid sites opens prospects for the development of efficient hybrid catalysts for esterification reaction, which overcomes the main limitations of common POM based catalysts such as low stability of the acid sites during the synthesis and the catalytic reaction, low surface area, agglomeration of the catalytically active phase and low stability of the Lewis metal center in presence of water. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Vegetable oil fuels, such as bio-oil, stand out as biofuel. For the production of bio-oil, a widely used system is the cracking process, which aims to decompose the triacylglycerides of vegetable oil into hydrocarbons and free fatty acids. The Fodder radish (Raphanus sativus L.) was selected as a raw material and the oil was subjected to thermal cracking at three temperatures, 400, 600 and 800 °C. The bio-oils obtained have chemical compounds such as hydrocarbons, alcohols, ethers and ketones and the absence of aromatic compounds, which are harmful to health. The physical-chemical properties of bio-oils showed a high acidity and water content. The esterification of the bio-oils was made using a simple and easy method and the esterification contributed to improve the physico-chemical properties of the bio-oil, and CONF-e 600 being the esterified bio-oil with the highest amount of hydrocarbons. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We aimed to produce simultaneously biosurfactants and lipases in solid state fermentation (SSF) using Aspergillus niger, followed by the use of the fermented media on the bioremediation of oily contaminated soil, in order to valuate agro industrial residuals and reduce the contamination. The biocompounds were produced using wheat bran and corncob (80:20), 5% of soybean oil and 0.5% of sugar cane molasses in SSF for 4 d, producing 4.58 ± 0.69 UE of emulsifying activity and 7.77 ± 1.52 U of lipolytic activity. This fermented media was used in the bioremediation of a 20% biodiesel contaminated soil, evaluating for 90 d microbial growth, contaminant degradation, and production of lipases and biosurfactants in soils. Six experimental strategies (natural attenuation; biostimulation + bioaugmentation + biocompounds; biostimulation + biosurfactant; biocompounds extract; biostimulation; adsorption of contaminant) were realized. The highest degradation of contaminant was verified in 90 d, of 74.40 ± 1.76%, and the production of biosurfactants and lipases in situ in the soil was found in 30 d (6.02 ± 0.24% of reduction in surface tension and 6.62 ± 0.17 UL of lipid activity in soil) for the same experiment (biostimulation + bioaugmentation + biocompounds). The addition of biostimulation + biosurfactant promotes higher biodegradation (66.00 ± 0.92%) of the contaminant than the biocompounds extract (59.58 ± 0.34%). The use of a solid fermented culture medium containing both biocompounds was feasible for the treatment of contaminants, demonstrating the potential for environmental application without the need for purification processes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Focusing on tailpipe emissions, current EU policies do not favor the use of biofuels in transports. This paper analyzes the well-to-wheel climate performance of gas and electric vehicles in Europe, taking into account the share of biomethane in vehicle gas as well as the production systems for biomethane and electricity in different countries. The results show that both gas and electric vehicles can significantly reduce the climate change impact of transports compared to diesel. In an average European electricity system, electricity has around 30% lower climate impact than diesel for a heavy truck, and 65–70% lower for a passenger car or city bus. Average European vehicle gas reduces the climate impact by up to 28% compared to diesel, or 11% compared to fossil natural gas, and in some countries vehicle gas has lower climate impact than electricity. This demonstrates the importance of not limiting analysis and policy to tailpipe emissions. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Rhizopus oryzae lipase immobilised onto differently functionalised polymethacrylate (Purolite®) and magnetite superparamagnetic supports was assessed as a catalyst for biodiesel production with pomace oil. The presence of surface hydrocarbon chains increased the operational stability of the biocatalysts supported on Purolite® and superparamagnetic particles up to 9 and 2 times, respectively. By contrast, the presence of functional groups had no effect on the initial transesterification rate, which was twice higher with the lipase immobilised onto Purolite®. Also, functionalising Purolite® with epoxide and octadecyl groups led to the highest biodiesel and volumetric productivity. This biocatalyst with other substrates including makauba, jatropha, waste cooking oil, and microbial oil, led to similar initial reaction rates. However, simply raising substrate acidity from 0.5 to 2% increased the operational stability of the biocatalysts 15 times. A synergistic effect between acyl-acceptor concentration and substrate acidity was observed. The transesterification reaction was successfully scaled up to 50 mL. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Crambe abyssinica is a non-edible crop able to adapt to adverse climatic conditions, arising as an alternative feedstock for biodiesel production. With this objective, an eco-friendly route for biodiesel production from crambe oil by enzymatic transesterification was evaluated in order to maximize fatty acid methyl esters content. Response Surface Methodology and central composite design (two factors, three levels, one central point, two replicas) was used to obtain predictive models considering catalyst concentration and methanol:oil molar ratio as independent variables. Since the reaction was monitored overtime, a predictive model considering three independent variables (three factors, three levels) was also obtained. Enzymatic transesterification is a good alternative process to obtain high FAME yield, with 84 ± 5 wt % being obtained after 2 h using a methanol:oil molar ratio 6:1 and 8 wt% of enzyme, a value which predictably can increase to almost 99 wt% after 24 h. The results showed that the methanol:oil molar ratio and the enzyme's concentration considerably influence the FAME content during enzymatic catalyzed reaction. The polynomial regression models obtained can help to balance the concentration of enzyme and alcohol to improve FAME production and to predict the resulting yield. © 2021

AB  - Sustainable liquid fuel production from bio-oil compounds has attracted considerable attention in recent years. The catalytic etherification of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF) is an effective approach for the production of liquid fuels. However, the development of high-performance and chemically stable catalysts has remained challenging. In this work, ultra-small Pd-Ru NPs were successfully immobilized on the surfaces of 2D MXene nanosheets (Pd-Ru/MXene) via fish sperm DNA-assisted microwave process. HR-TEM imaging results with SAED analysis showed that the hexagonal closed-pack (hcp) Pd-Ru NPs were grown on the surfaces of sheet-like MXene, thus enhancing the specific surface area of 117 m2 g−1 and providing a higher density of the acid-base sites. Furthermore, Pd-Ru/MXene was employed for the etherification of HMF into EMF. The results showed that the Pd-Ru/MXene catalyst exhibited 98% EMF yield and 100% HMF conversion with the prolonged usage of catalyst for five consecutive reuse cycles. Additionally, fructose was directly converted into EMF with a higher yield of 82% over the Pd-Ru/MXene catalyst at lower reaction conditions. The recyclability test of the used Pd-Ru/MXene catalyst demonstrated its chemical stability under prolonged usage for several hours and is therefore suitable for commercial renewable liquid fuel production. Novelty Statement: The catalytic transformation of biomass into diesel-miscible biofuel is a sustainable route for liquid fuel production and has recently attracted massive attention. The chemically stable and high-performance Pd-Ru/MXene catalyst was successfully prepared and characterized. The study demonstrated that the Pd-Ru/MXene catalyst exhibits superior catalytic activity toward the direct conversion of fructose and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) into 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (5-EMF), which is a promising conversion method for the production of biofuels from biomass. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - A new type of solid catalyst prepared from hydrothermal reaction of natural diatomaceous earth in NaOH solution was studied for biodiesel production through the transesterification of soybean and palm oil in excess methanol. Explicitly, the natural diatomite was transformed into efficacious catalysts, sequentially, by dispersion and activation in NaOH solutions for 30 min at 30 °C, followed by hydrothermal treatments at 180 °C or 220 °C for 12 h, and finally by calcination at 500 °C for 6 h. Coincidently, the physicochemical characteristics of these as-prepared catalysts were shown to bear a good resemblance with those of zeolite CAN. Under suitable conditions, the conversion efficiencies of soybean and palm oils to biodiesel in presence of these zeolite CAN catalysts at 63 °C and 70 °C could be obtained as high as 98.0% and 98.4%, respectively. Furthermore, the activation energies of the transesterification reactions of soybean and palm oils in excess methanol were found as 64.1 kJ/mol and 122.5 kJ/mol, respectively. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Water is essential in conversion of crop to bioenergy. Therefore, it is important to carefully evaluate the impact of bioenergy technology on water source. Life cycle water footprints of biobutanol from wheat straw, corn grain and corn stover are analyzed in this study according to the characteristics of crop growing and climate conditions. The results show that life cycle water footprints of biobutanol from wheat straw, corn grain and corn stover are 271, 108 and 240 L H2O/MJ biobutanol, respectively. Life cycle water footprints of the crop production stage for wheat straw, corn grain and corn stover are 269.89, 107.84 and 238.95 L H2O/MJ biobutanol, respectively. Owing to the use of fertilizer in the crop production stage, gray water footprint of wheat straw, corn grain and corn stover accounts for 91.08%, 86.65% and 86.40% of the life cycle water footprint, respectively. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A highly reactive acid-functionalized polymer is prepared by the simple condensation of aqueous formaldehyde and p-phenolsulfonic acid and used as a solid catalyst in concerted (trans)esterification. This yields biodiesel from Jatropha oil without the need to remove water by-product from the reaction mixture. An isolated biodiesel yield of 98 ± 2% is achieved using a catalyst loading of 10 wt %, methanol:oil ratio of 12:1, temperature of 90 °C, and reaction time of 6 h. The high activity of our catalyst is attributed to its porous nature and the co-inclusion of reactive SO3H sites and phenolic OH groups. Advantageously, these groups are hydrophilic, allowing the catalyst to remain highly active in the presence of H2O. Nine methyl ester components are identified in the biodiesel product, with 9-octadecanoic acid methyl ester (C18:2, 64.92%) and hexadecanoic acid methyl ester (C16:0, 16.44%) as the major constituents. The catalyst is evaluated over 4 cycles, maintaining a 92 ± 2% isolated yield. Physicochemical analysis of the spent catalyst by SEM-EDX suggests this decrease is due to some loss of mesoporosity and sulfur content. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In recent years, biofuels have been attracting more attention, especially in Europe, due to the new regulations concerning the improvement of renewables in fuel composition. The acid-catalysed alcoholysis reaction of the cellulosic fraction of raw and pre-treated lignocellulosic biomasses, using n-Butanol (n-BuOH) and diluted inorganic acid as homogeneous catalyst, produces a mixture mainly composed by Butyl Levulinate (BL) from cellulose, Dibutyl ether (DBE) from n-BuOH etherification and unreacted n-BuOH. This last can be then separated and recycled, so increasing the sustainability of the whole process. BL is directly obtained from cellulosic fraction of not edible biomass and represents a promising advanced biofuel. Therefore, in the different types of blends containing the main products obtainable from the one-pot alcoholysis of lignocellulosic biomasses, BL represents the effective renewable component of the fuel. In this work, different blends of BL/DBE mixed with Diesel fuel were tested in a small single-cylinder air-cooled Diesel engine with direct injection. Data concerning the measurement of pollutant emission, engine performance and combustion characteristics are reported. Results have been compared with those obtained fuelling the engine with a conventional Diesel fuel. The mixtures were prepared by using commercial reactants, characterized by compositions analogous to those of the reaction mixtures. The obtained results evidenced the potentiality of these novel blending mixtures to reduce the emissions of particulate without any increasing of NOx emission or changing in engine power and efficiency. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Three species of freshwater planktonic green microalgae: Ankistrodesmus braunii, Ankistrodesmus falcatus, and Scenedesmus incrassatulus, were isolated from the Nile water in Upper Egypt. These microalgae were exposed to nutritional (nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron) limitations and salinity stress to study their effects on the algal growth and to elevate the lipid content within their cells. The results indicated that exposure to these conditions had a significant impact on the algal growth. The lipid content of the studied algae increased as a result of the salinity stress. The highest lipid content was recorded in A. braunii culture treated with 50 mM NaCl (34.4% of dry weight) and S. incrassatulus cultures treated with 100 mM NaCl (37.7% of dry weight) on the 6th day of cultivation, while the culture of A. falcatus treated with 100 mM NaCl recorded the maximum lipid content (53% of dry weight) on the 10th day of the experiment. The biodiesel quality parameters of the fatty acid methyl ester profile of S. incrassatulus appeared to be in agreement with the international criteria. S. incrassatulus could be regarded as a quite promising feedstock for the biodiesel production. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The research work investigates the combustion, performance, and emission characteristics of a CI engine using neat biodiesel (B100: 100% rubber seed oil methyl ester) mixed with alumina and titanium oxide nanoparticles in the proportions of 25 ppm and 50 ppm separately. Nanoparticles (alumina and titanium dioxide) in different proportions like 25 ppm and 50 ppm were mixed with the neat biodiesel, and 2% of surfactant (Span80) was added, and the mixtures were agitated by an ultrasonicator to achieve uniform particle dispersion in the blend. The nanoparticle-blended biodiesel mixtures are designated as B100A25 (B100 + 25 ppm of alumina), B100A50 (B100 + 50 ppm of alumina), B100T25 (B100 + 25 ppm of TiO2), and B100T50 (B100 + 50 ppm of TiO2). Experiments were conducted in a single-cylinder DI diesel engine using neat biodiesel blended with alumina and titanium dioxide nanoparticle mixtures at different operating conditions. The test results revealed that the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) of the engine with nanoparticle-blended fuel (B100T50) increased by 5.2% and brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) decreased by 10.56%. The CO, HC, and smoke emissions decreased by 44%, 28%, and 44%, respectively, whereas the NOx emissions increased by 21% as compared to that of neat biodiesel at full load. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Uncontrollable usage of gasoline products has accompanied by 5a very high rise in transportation sector causing globalization and contributing to the economy. Although this sector is growing quickly and providing benefits, it has some negative impact to the environment. Non-edible feedstock is being focussed for bio-diesel production, and researchers have introduced different non-edible oils and its influence on the IC engines. Calophyllum inophyllum is proved as one of the promising alternative fuels for future generation. In the current study, the influence of variation in IT 33°, 28°, 23° and 18° and effect of vibration over engine performance, combustion and emissions are examined. Investigation involves blends of B10, B20 and B30 with the hydrogen supply of 5 lpm, 10 lpm and 15 lpm at a standard speed of 1500 rpm, CR 17.5, IOP 200 bar. In overall experiment, the engine performance and combustion parameters were enhanced, at 28 degree IT, with a biofuel of B20 + 10 lpm of hydrogen when compared with all other combinations considered in the experimentation. Simultaneously found that vibrations and emissions were lower for B20 + 10 lpm of hydrogen flow at 28 degree IT. © 2021, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.

AB  - In this present study, hydro-deoxygenation (HDO) process was performed to upgrade the liquefied bio-oil of Nostoc punctriforme biomass. The engine performance and emission properties of the enriched bio-oil and blends (with diesel) were evaluated. The HTL resulted in highest bio-oil yield of 47.5 wt% at a temperature of 300 °C at 60 min with calorific value of 32.5 MJ/kg. At 60 min and temperature of 300 °C with 1 wt% of heterogeneous catalyst the upgraded HDO-bio-oil yield reached 38.4 wt% with deoxygenation percentage of 70%. The properties of upgraded bio-oil are HHV of 44.74 MJ/kg, Kinematic viscosity of 6.23 mm2/s and density 923 kg/m3 respectively. The response surface methodology (RSM) was used for modeling and optimizing the upgraded bio-oil yield. The optimized RSM conditions for upgraded bio-oil yield (44.5 wt%) are temperature of 280 °C, catalyst load of 0.6 wt%, and time of 120 min. The physiochemical properties of upgraded bio-oil are in agreement with ASTM standards. Equal proportion of bio-oil to diesel (D50: B50) reduced the brake thermal efficiency to 6.66% with reduced NOx emission and slight increase in CO emission. This study highlights that microalga fuels are better renewable energy resource with reduced greenhouse gas emission. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Ternary mixed biofuels are receiving increased scientific attention, and recently, researchers proposed different biofuel mixtures under dissimilar engine conditions; each researcher argued that his/her proposed one is the next generation alternative. Accordingly, such ternary biofuel mixtures are extremely needed to be compared against each other under the same engine conditions to provide the best/most promising one(s) as coming fuel alternative(s) for SI engines. In the current study, comparing of using ternary bio-methanol–iso-butanol–gasoline (MiB), bio-ethanol–n-butanol–gasoline (EnB), and bio-methanol–n-butanol–gasoline (MnB) fuel mixtures in pollutant releases and behavior/performance of SI engines is carried out for the first time. The ternary alcohol–gasoline combined fuels were also compared against dual alcohol–gasoline fuel mixtures. In particular, MiB is compared against iso-butanol–gasoline (iB) and bio-methanol–gasoline (M) fuel mixtures; EnB is compared against n-butanol–gasoline (nB) and bio-ethanol–gasoline (E) fuel mixtures; MnB is compared against nB and M fuel mixtures. The comparisons of all combined fuels (ternary and dual bases) are carried out experimentally at the same biofuel mixtures rates and engine working conditions and also compared against pure fossil–gasoline. The results showed that the behavior/performance of MiB, MnB, and EnB are all lower than the pure fossil–gasoline, except for pressure inside cylinder for MiB. The highest behavior/performance among all ternary biofuel mixtures is introduced by MiB. Comparisons of pollutant releases (CO, UHC, and CO2) showed that MiB has the lowest levels, while MnB showed the highest levels, among all ternary mixtures. Comparisons to pure fossil–gasoline, the MiB and EnB ternary mixtures introduced lower, but MnB showed higher pollutant releases than the pure fossil–gasoline fuel. © 2021, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.

AB  - The energy demand of the world is skyrocketing due to the exponential economic growth and population expansion. To meet the energy requirement, the use of fossil fuels is not a good decision, causing environmental pollution such as CO2 emissions. Therefore, the use of renewable energy sources like biofuels can meet the energy crisis especially for countries facing oil shortages such as Pakistan. This review describes the comparative study of biodiesel synthesis for various edible oils, non-edible oils, and wastes such as waste plastic oil, biomass pyrolysis oil, and tyre pyrolysis oil in terms of their oil content and extraction, cetane number, and energy content. The present study also described the importance of biodiesel synthesis via catalytic transesterification and its implementation in Pakistan. Pakistan is importing an extensive quantity of cooking oil that is used in the food processing industries, and as a result, a huge quantity of waste cooking oil (WCO) is generated. The potential waste oils for biodiesel synthesis are chicken fat, dairy scum, WCO, and tallow oil that can be used as potential substrates of biodiesel. The implementation of a biodiesel program as a replacement of conventional diesel will help to minimize the oil imports and uplift the country's economy. Biodiesel production via homogeneous and heterogeneous catalyzed transesterification is more feasible among all transesterification processes due to a lesser energy requirement and low cost. Therefore, biodiesel synthesis and implementation could minimize the imports of diesel by significantly contributing to the overall Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Although, waste oil can meet the energy needs, more available cultivation land should be used for substrate cultivation. In addition, research is still needed to explore innovative solvents and catalysts so that overall biodiesel production cost can be minimized. This would result in successful biodiesel implementation in Pakistan. © 2021 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society.

AB  - Transition to a new energy low carbon pool requires the gradual replacing of fossil fuels with other cleaner energies and biofuels. In this work, the environmental impact of renewable diesel production using an attributional life cycle assessment was evaluated by considering five stages: palm plantation-culture-harvest, palm oil extraction, palm oil refining, green (renewable) diesel production, and biofuel use. The functional unit was established as 1.6 × 10−2 m3 (13.13 kg) of renewable diesel. The results show that the production of renewable diesel by Hydro-processed Esters and Fatty Acids is more environmentally friendly than fossil diesel production. In particular, the analysis showed that the CO2 emission decreases around 110% (i.e. mitigation occurred) compared with conventional diesel production. However, renewable diesel production has a relevant environmental impact in the human toxicity category due to the high consumption of agrochemicals during palm culture. © Copyright © 2021 Arguelles-Arguelles, Amezcua-Allieri and Ramírez-Verduzco.

AB  - Combination of butanol-hyperproducing and hypertolerant phenotypes is essential for developing microbial strains suitable for industrial production of bio-butanol, one of the most promising liquid biofuels. Clostridium cellulovorans is among the microbial strains with the highest potential for direct production of n-butanol from lignocellulosic wastes, a process that would significantly reduce the cost of bio-butanol. However, butanol exhibits higher toxicity compared to ethanol and C. cellulovorans tolerance to this solvent is low. In the present investigation, comparative gel-free proteomics was used to study the response of C. cellulovorans to butanol challenge and understand the tolerance mechanisms activated in this condition. Sequential Window Acquisition of all Theoretical fragment ion spectra Mass Spectrometry (SWATH-MS) analysis allowed identification and quantification of differentially expressed soluble proteins. The study data are available via ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD024183. The most important response concerned modulation of protein biosynthesis, folding and degradation. Coherent with previous studies on other bacteria, several heat shock proteins (HSPs), involved in protein quality control, were up-regulated such as the chaperones GroES (Cpn10), Hsp90, and DnaJ. Globally, our data indicate that protein biosynthesis is reduced, likely not to overload HSPs. Several additional metabolic adaptations were triggered by butanol exposure such as the up-regulation of V- and F-type ATPases (involved in ATP synthesis/generation of proton motive force), enzymes involved in amino acid (e.g., arginine, lysine, methionine, and branched chain amino acids) biosynthesis and proteins involved in cell envelope re-arrangement (e.g., the products of Clocel_4136, Clocel_4137, Clocel_4144, Clocel_4162 and Clocel_4352, involved in the biosynthesis of saturated fatty acids) and a redistribution of carbon flux through fermentative pathways (acetate and formate yields were increased and decreased, respectively). Based on these experimental findings, several potential gene targets for metabolic engineering strategies aimed at improving butanol tolerance in C. cellulovorans are suggested. This includes overexpression of HSPs (e.g., GroES, Hsp90, DnaJ, ClpC), RNA chaperone Hfq, V- and F-type ATPases and a number of genes whose function in C. cellulovorans is currently unknown. © Copyright © 2021 Costa, Usai, Re, Manfredi, Mannino, Bertea, Pessione and Mazzoli.

AB  - Understanding potential health risks associated with biofuel production is critical to sustainably combating energy insecurity and climate change. However, the specific health impacts associated with biorefinery-related emissions are not yet well characterized. We evaluated the relationship between respiratory emergency department (ED) visits (2011-2015) and residential exposure to biorefineries by comparing 15 biorefinery sites to 15 control areas across New York (NY) State. We further examined these associations by biorefinery types (e.g., corn, wood, or soybean), seasons, and lower respiratory disease subtypes. We measured biorefinery exposure using residential proximity in a cross-sectional study and estimation of biorefinery emission via AERMOD-simulated modeling. After controlling for multiple confounders, we consistently found that respiratory ED visit rates among residents living within 10 km of biorefineries were significantly higher (rate ratios (RRs) range from 1.03 to 3.64) than those in control areas across our two types of exposure indices. This relationship held across biorefinery types (higher in corn and soybean biorefineries), seasons (higher in spring and winter), air pollutant types (highest for NO2), and respiratory subtypes (highest for emphysema). Further research is needed to confirm our findings. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Duckweeds are efficient aquatic plants for wastewater treatment due to their high nutrient uptake capabilities, growth rates, and resilience to severe environmental conditions. The high starch and cellulose contents of duckweed species make them an attractive feedstock for biofuels and biochemicals. Experimental studies have shown that sequential anaerobic bioprocessing of duckweed into ethanol, carboxylates, methane, and soil amendment in a biorefinery system is technically feasible. This study aims to identify challenges and opportunities for large-scale wastewater-derived duckweed biorefineries as a way to promote a circular bioeconomy. The most suitable end products from wastewater-derived duckweed biomass, determined in a series of previously reported laboratory batch experiments, were used to estimate the bioproduct yields during the hypothetical operation of a large-scale biorefinery. Techno-economic analysis (TEA) revealed a minimum duckweed selling price of $7.69 Mg-1 dry matter and a minimum ethanol selling price of $2.17/L or $8.23 gal-1. Duckweed pond construction and duckweed harvesting accounted for the largest share of capital (55.6%) and operating expenses (90.4%), respectively. A cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA) revealed that duckweed pond construction led to increased land use change impacts, but water-quality and eutrophication impacts could be significantly reduced with this integrated system through efficient nutrient upcycling. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Producing renewable biofuels from biomass is a promising way to meet future energy demand. Here, we demonstrated a lignin to diesel route via dimerization of the lignin oil followed by hydrodeoxygenation. The lignin oil undergoes C−C bond dehydrogenative coupling over Au/CdS photocatalyst under visible light irradiation, co-generating diesel precursors and hydrogen. The Au nanoparticles loaded on CdS can effectively restrain the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, thus improving the efficiency of the dimerization reaction. About 2.4 mmol gcatal−1 h−1 dimers and 1.6 mmol gcatal−1 h−1 H2 were generated over Au/CdS, which is about 12 and 6.5 times over CdS, respectively. The diesel precursors are finally converted into C16–C18 cycloalkanes or aromatics via hydrodeoxygenation reaction using Pd/C or porous CoMoS catalyst, respectively. The conversion of pine sawdust to diesel was performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the lignin-to-diesel route. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - Polar aromatic compounds (PACs) adsorbed on soot produced in laboratory premixed flames of fossil kerosene (Jet A-1), synthetic paraffinic kerosene (SPK), and Jet A-1/synthetic biofuels (2,5-dimethylfuran, methyloctanoate, diethylcarbonate, and 1-butanol) were characterized for the first time with the aim of shedding light on the combustion mechanisms and evaluating the environmental impact of these synthetic biofuels. The following families of compounds were fractionated from the soot extracts, and furthermore, their relative abundances were estimated: (a) oxa-AHs (xanthenes, benzoxanthene, alcoxy-AHs, furan derivatives...); (b) aldehydes-AHs, (c) ketones-AHs; (d) quinones-AHs; (e) aromatic monocarboxylic acids; (f) aromatic hydroxy acids; (g) aromatic dicarboxylic acids; (h) nitrated-AHs (including amines, acridines, cinnoline derivatives, carbazoles...); and (i) nitro-AHs. The results obtained point out that overall, soot from Jet A-1/biofuel premixed flames is richer in PACs than soot from pure Jet A-1 and SPK. Out of the fuels studied, Jet A-1/1-butanol produces the highest concentrations of nitro-AHs (namely, nitro-benzaldehydes), aldehydes-AHs, and hydroxy-AHs (including two isomers of hydroxy-benzaldehyde), whereas Jet A-1/diethylcarbonate produces the highest concentrations of quinones-AHs (especially phenanthrene quinones) and large concentrations of nitrated-AHs. On the other hand, soot from Jet A-1/methyloctanoate is the richest one in mono-aromatic and dicarboxylic acids, aromatic hydroxyacids, nitrated-AHs, and esters. Combustion of the Jet A-1/2,5-dimethylfuran mixture emits the highest concentrations of ketones-AHs and oxa-AHs (namely, furan derivatives). We should remark that although the soot samples were obtained from premixed flames, the lab conditions being far from the industrial conditions, particularly in terms of pressure; the chemistry going on should not be so different that our findings could not be extrapolated to industrial conditions. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biofuel may be an important component of aviation fuel for its significant advantages. In the present work, two biofuel samples, methyl laurate and pinane, are selected for blending research withn-dodecane, a typical model fuel of aviation kerosene. Densities and viscosities for the ternary system pinane (1) +n-dodecane (2) + methyl laurate (3) and corresponding binary systems have been measured at the temperatures from 293.15 to 333.15 K and atmospheric pressure. The excess molar volume (VmE) and viscosity deviation (Δη) of binary systems have been calculated based on experimental data and fitted to the Redlich-Kister equation, while those of the ternary system have been fitted to Nagata-Tamura, Redlich-Kister, Cibulka, and Singh semiempirical equations, respectively. The values of the excess molar volume are all positive for all investigated systems, while the viscosity deviations are all negative. The results are discussed from the perspective of intermolecular force and the structure. Furthermore, the densities and viscosities of both binary and ternary mixtures are satisfactorily correlated using the Jouyban-Acree model. © 2021 American Chemical Society

AB  - Nanosized polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) have been employed as molecular weight enlarged structures for different purposes owing to their ease of synthesis and modification. In this work, the commercially available compound octaphenyl-POSS has been modified with chlorosulfonic acid to obtain multifunctional acidic materials (H-Sulfo-POSS) with different degrees of functionality in the structure. The synthesized materials have been characterized by ion exchange capacity, degree of sulfonation,1H-NMR, ATR-IR spectroscopy and SEM. These H-Sulfo-POSS nanocomposites were then applied to the acetalization of glycerol with 2-butanone to yield the corresponding ketal, which is a product of interest as an oxygenate fuel additive. The catalytic activity in dynamic experiments of the H-Sulfo-POSS (2601 h−1) material with the highest degree of sulfonation was even higher than that shown by the molecular catalystpara-toluene sulfonic acid (PTSA) (2256 h−1) and better than Amberlyst 36 (213 h−1); however, upon recycling by centrifugation of the catalyst, the activity of this material was not very stable. On the other hand, the material with the lowest degree of sulfonation showed not only higher activity than Amberlyst 36, but also very stable activity after reutilization throughout 10 runs. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

AB  - Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), one of the effective approaches of C-O bond scission, plays a crucial role in biomass-derived oxygenate conversion to high value-added chemicals and biofuels. Herein, we systematically investigated the HDO reaction of furfural (FAL) to 2-methylfuran (2-MF) over 17 kinds of Ni-based bimetallic catalysts based on periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The Ni-based partner (3d and 4d metals) has an important influence on the catalytic performance toward the FAL HDO reaction, which modifies the Ni electronic environment and induces the bimetal d orbital overlap, giving rise to changes in adsorption configuration and reaction activity. A specific correlation between the oxygen binding energy (OBE) value and energy barrier of C-OH scission/*OH species hydrogenation suggests that OBE serves as the most appropriate descriptor to characterize the activity of bimetallic catalysts. Due to the competitive relationship between C-O scission and *OH species hydrogenation, a trade-off of OBE has been built to promote C-O scission and hydrogenation activity simultaneously, in which Ni-M (M = Fe, Co, Mo, or Ru) bimetallic catalysts show prominent catalytic performance. Besides, we revealed that this descriptor can be extended to other bimetallic catalysts (CoV, CoFe, CuCo). Based on the calculation prediction, we prepared several alloys (NiCu, NiCo and NiZr). A series of characterization techniques (HRTEM, EDS, XPS, H2-TPR) indicated the formation of the alloys, whose catalytic evaluations verify that Ni-based catalysts (e.g., NiCo) with a compromise OBE value (from −4.00 to −2.00 eV) exhibit enhanced catalytic behavior towards FAL HDO to 2-MF, superior to other ones (e.g., NiCu: OBE value &gt; −2.00 eV; NiZr: OBE value &lt; −4.00 eV). This work offers a feasible strategy to design bimetallic catalysts for the HDO reaction based on the electronic environment and chemical nature of doped metals. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

AB  - This study focuses on bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) in fuel generation and assesses the potential of biofuel generation to decarbonise the fuel economy by reducing CO2emissions to the atmosphere. The research investigates the technical, economic, and environmental performances of three biofuel production routes, namely Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS), bio-synthetic natural gas (bioSNG) and oxymethylene ethers (OMEx) synthesis using flowsheets developed in Aspen Plus. It constitutes the first attempt to holistically evaluate both the techno-economic performance and the environmental benefits of employing BECCS in fuel generation. For an input of 1020 dry tonnes per day of woody biomass, the FTS route yields 275 t d−1, the bioSNG route yields 238 t d−1and the OMExroute yields 635 t d−1of fuel and the energy efficiency is in the range of 44.9% to59.7% without CCS and 44.0% to 58.2% with CCS. In addition, negative emissions can be achieved for all routes with CCS in the range of 301 000 to 519 000 tCO2per year. For economic viability, the minimum selling price for FT-fuels, bioSNG, and OMExproduction with CCS have been calculated as £23.4 per GJ, £14.5 per GJ and £26.5 per GJ, respectively. However, competition with conventional fossil-derived fuels is not possible without the combination of existing financial incentives and a proposed carbon pricing. With carbon credit as the only financial incentive, carbon pricing in the range of £48 to £86 per tCO2needs to be applied to achieve feasibility. Also, more negative emissions need to be generated to decrease the value of this range and reasonably phase out dependence on fossil-derived fuels. Parametric studies identified as crucial parameters to be improved the fuel output, CAPEX, operating hours and feedstock cost. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

AB  - Sulfides of NiMo over a series of commercial ultra-stable Y zeolites were studied in an autoclave reactor to elucidate the effect of silica/alumina ratio (SAR = 12, 30, and 80) on the cleavage of etheric C-O (β-O-4) and C-C (both sp3-sp2and sp2-sp2) linkages present in native/technical lignin and lignin derived bio-oils. 2-Phenethyl phenyl ether (PPE), 4,4-dihydroxydiphenylmethane (DHDPM), and 2-phenylphenol, (2PP) were examined as model dimers at 345 °C and 50 bar of total pressure using dodecane as the solvent. The etheric C-O hydrogenolysis activity was found to be in the order NiMoY30 &gt; NiMoY12 &gt; NiMoY80, despite a high initial rate of C-O cleavage over NiMoY12 owing to its high acid density. A high degree of hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) and hydrocracking reactions were observed with NiMoY30 yielding &gt;80% of deoxygenated products of which ∼58% are benzene, toluene, and ethylbenzenes. A similar experiment with DHDPM showed the rapid cleavage of the methylene-linked C-C dimer (sp3-sp2) to phenols and cresols even with the low acid density (high SAR) catalyst, NiMoY80. Direct hydrocracking of the recalcitrant 5-5′ linkage in 2PP is very slow, however, it cleavedviaa cascade of HDO, ring-hydrogenation, and hydrocracking reactions. A high degree of hydrogenolysis and hydrocracking occurs over NiMoY30 due to suitable balance between acidity and pore accessibility, enhanced proximity between acidic and deoxygenation sites leading to a slightly higher dispersion of Ni promoted MoS2crystallites. Overall, the product spectrum consisted of a high yield of deoxygenated products. The carbon content on the recovered catalyst was in the range of 3-7 wt%. These results pave the way for effective catalysts to break recalcitrant linkages present in lignin to obtain a hydrocarbon-rich liquid transportation fuel. An experiment with Kraft lignin over NiMoY30 shows good selectivity for deoxygenated aromatics and cycloalkanes in the liquid phase. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

AB  - Environmental protection and the depletion of nonrenewable energy sources necessitate the search for the replacement of, among others, diesel fuel (Df) in diesel engines with renewable fuel without major structural changes. For this reason, vegetable oils are of interest as a possible fuel for this type of engine. Unfortunately, the physicochemical properties of vegetable oils differ significantly from Df. In addition to the boiling and freezing points, these properties include viscosity, density, and surface tension as well as wetting properties. For this reason, an attempt was made to modify these properties by adding n-hexane (Hex) and ethanol (Et) to canola oil (Co). The viscosity, density, surface tension, and wetting properties of Hex and Et are significantly different from those for Co. For the determination of the influence of Hex and Et on these properties of Co, the Co and Hex (10% and 15% w/w) mixtures and Co-Hex (10% and 15% w/w)-Et (0-5% w/w) mixtures were studied. The wetting properties of the studied mixtures were tested by the advancing contact angle measurements on polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), and engine valve. The obtained results suggest that there is a synergetic effect in lowering the surface tension and density of Co with the addition of Hex and Et, and the high Co viscosity is significantly reduced by the addition of Hex and Et. Co viscosity at 15% Hex and 5% Et concentrations are similar to Df. Based on the obtained results of the physicochemical properties of the mixtures studied, the engine tests were carried out on a chassis dynamometer. In the engine tests, it was found that for the mixture of 85% Co, 13% Hex, and 2% Et, the mean indicated pressures were higher than the mean indicated pressure for Df at engine speeds of 2000 rpm, 2500 rpm, 3500 rpm, and 4000 rpm. The reason for the increase in the mean indicated pressure for the mixtures of 85% Co, 13% Hex, and 2% Et should be seen in the shift of the indicator graph towards the top dead position of the piston and further. This way, the range of positive work in the open indicator chart is increased. In mixtures with Et and Co, the onset of combustion occurred later than for other fuels. This phenomenon is related to the fact that the autoignition delay angle for these fuels has increased. The use of Hex and Et as an additive to Co allows the use of refined Co (straight vegetable oil - SVO) to supply diesel engines of various types, also those equipped with a common rail injection system. The use of unrefined canola oil converted to ester is most advantageous in terms of energy. The physicochemical properties of mixtures of canola oil, Hex, and Et are similar to diesel. This allows for the use of Co as fuel in a much wider range of ambient temperatures than before. Such fuel may be produced and applied directly on a farm producing rapeseed. © 2021 SAE International.

AB  - Notwithstanding the substantial progress acheved since 2010 in the attempts to realize the potential of microalgae biofuels in the transportation sector, the prospects for commercial production of CO2-neutral biofuels are more challenging today than they were in 2010. Pure P. moriformis microalgae oil was subjected to unmodified engine performance testing as a less investigated type of fuel. Conventional diesel was used as a reference fuel to compare and to contrast the energy balances of an engine as well as to juxtapose performance and emission indicators for both unary fuels. According to the methodology applied, the variation of BSFC rates, BTE, smoke opacity, NOx, HC, CO2, O2, and exhaust gas temperature on three different loads were established during compression ignition (CI) engine operation at EGR Off, 25% EGR, 18% EGR and 9% EGR modes, respec-tively. Simulation model (AVL Boost/BURN) was employed to assess the in-cylinder process parameters (pressure, pressure rise, temperature, temperature rise, ROHR, and MFB). Furthermore, the first law energy balances for an engine running on each of the test fuels were built up to provide useful insights about the peculiarities of energy conversion. Not depending on EGR mode applied, the CI engine running on microalgae oil was responsible for slightly higher BTE values, drastically reduced smoke opacity, higher CO2 values, and smaller O2 concentration, marginally increased NOx levels and lower total energy losses (in %) if compared to the performance with diesel fuel. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - In order to explore the influence of EGR at different altitudes on the performance of biofuel diesel engines, a comparative experimental study is conducted with the biodiesel–ethanol– diesel B15E5 (biodiesel with 15% volume fraction, ethanol with 5% volume fraction and diesel with 80% volume fraction) mixed fuel at different EGR rate and different atmospheric pressure. The experimental results show that diesel engine power performance and economy goes up with the increase of atmospheric pressure, and it decreases with the increase of EGR rate. At 2200 rpm, the improvement range of medium and high diesel engine load is 1.5–6.8%, and that of 1800 rpm is 2.8–11.7%. At the same atmospheric pressure, with the increase of EGR rate, the power and economy turn worse. The peak combustion pressure and heat release rate both increased with the increase of the atmospheric pressure at full load. At the same atmospheric pressure, peak combustion pressure and peak heat release rate fall with the increase of EGR rate. At part load, firstly, smoke emissions fall with the increase of the load and then rise. As the atmospheric pressure goes up, the smoke emissions show a downward trend, with a decline of 6.6–40%, while the NOx emissions show a rising trend, with an increase of 1.2–8.5%. At the same atmospheric pressure, the smoke emission increase with the increase of EGR rate by 9–12.5%, and the NOx emissions increase with the decrease of EGR rate by 2.5–6.8%. The HC and CO Emissions decrease with the increase of atmospheric pressure. HC emission decreases by 9.3–19.1%, and CO emission decreases by 2.9–16.6%. At the same atmospheric pressure, the HC emission decreases with the increase of the EGR rate by 3.3–4.5% at medium and high loads, and the CO emission increases with the EGR rate by 3.1–4.5%. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - In this study, engine performance on thermal factors for different biodiesels has been studied and compared with diesel fuel. Biodiesels were produced from Pongamia pinnata (PP), Calophyllum inophyllum (CI), waste cooking oil (WCO), and acid oil. Depending on their free fatty acid content, they were subjected to the transesterification process to produce biodiesel. The main characterizations of density, calorific range, cloud, pour, flash and fire point followed by the viscosity of obtained biodiesels were conducted and compared with mineral diesel. The characterization results presented benefits near to standard diesel fuel. Then the proposed diesel engine was analyzed using four blends of higher concentrations of B50, B65, B80, and B100 to better substitute fuel for mineral diesel. For each blend, different biodiesels were compared, and the relative best performance of the biodiesel is concluded. This diesel engine was tested in terms of BSFC (brake-specific fuel consumption), BTE (brake thermal efficiency), and EGT (exhaust gas temperature) calculated with the obtained results. The B50 blend of acid oil provided the highest BTE compared to other biodiesels at all loads while B50 blend of WCO provided the lowest BSFC compared to other biodiesels, and B50 blends of all biodiesels provided a minimum % of the increase in EGT compared to diesel. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Methanolysis of vegetable oils in the presence of homogeneous catalysts remains the most important process for producing biodiesel. However, there is still a lack of accurate description of the reaction kinetics. This is in part due to the complexity of the reacting system in which a large number of interconnected reactions take place simultaneously. In this work, attention is focused on the biphasic character of the reaction medium, formed by two immiscible liquid phases. The behavior of the phases is investigated regarding their physicochemical properties, mainly density and mutual solubility of the components, as well as composition. In addition, two kinetic models with different level of complexity regarding the biphasic character of the reaction medium have been developed. It has been found that a heterogeneous model considering the presence of the two phases and the distribution of the several compounds between them is indispensable to get a good description of the process in terms of oil conversion and products yields. The model captures the effects of the main variables of an isothermal batch methanolysis process: methanol/oil molar ratio, reaction time and catalyst concentration. Nevertheless, some adjustment is still required as concerns modelling of the saponification reactions and catalyst deactivation. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This research investigates the effects of a synthetic diesel-like fuel (Fischer-Tropsch diesel) and biofuels (ethanol and biodiesel) fuel blends on the energy-exergy efficiencies and gaseous exhaust emissions characteristics of a compression ignition engine. Two blends of alternative fuels denoted as E15B35FTD50 (15% ethanol, 35% biodiesel, and 50% Fischer-Tropsch diesel) and E15B35D50 (15% ethanol, 35% biodiesel, and 50% diesel) were experimentally studied on a single-cylinder diesel engine and compared to diesel fuel. The results show that the energetic and the ex-ergetic efficiencies of the alternative fuels are comparable to those of the engine fueled with diesel fuel. The unburnt HC, NO, N2O, and NH3 emissions were reduced for the two alternative fuel blends compared to diesel, while CO emissions increased. The light HC species were found to slightly increase for the alternative fuel blends in comparison with diesel fuel. However, the total HC was considerably reduced by the combustion of E15B35FTD50 not only when compared to the diesel fuel combustion, but also when compared to E15B35D50. Overall, these results may contrib-ute to identifying advantages and limitations in terms of energetic-exergetic analysis and emissions for the new generation of conventional diesel and hybrid electric vehicles that aim to achieve future emissions regulations. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Abstract: A platinum catalyst and a ruthenium catalyst were synthesized from a porousaromatic framework, namely PAF-30. The catalyst properties were examined inhydrogenation of phenol and guaiacol at 80–250°C and at a hydrogen pressure of30 atm in the presence of various solvents. Significant effects of the reactionmedium, process conditions, and catalyst morphology on the reaction mechanismwere demonstrated. Reaction conditions optimal for complete conversion of phenoland guaiacol to hydrogenation products were selected for both catalysts.

AB  - Alternative and sustainable waste sources are receiving increasing attention as they can be used to produce biofuels with a low carbon footprint. Waste fish oil is one such example and can be considered an abundant and sustainable waste source to produce biodiesel. Ultimately this could lead to fishing communities having their own ‘off-grid’ source of fuel for boats and vehicles. At the industrial level, biodiesel is currently produced by homogeneous catalysis because of the high catalyst activity and selectivity. In contrast, heterogeneous catalysis offers several advantages such as improved reusability, reduced waste and lower processing costs. Here we investigate the phase evolution of two heterogeneous catalysts, CaO and a Ca3Al2O6:CaO (‘C3A:CaO’) composite, under in-situ conditions for biodiesel production from fish oil. A new reactor was designed to monitor the evolution of the crystalline catalyst during the reaction using synchrotron powder x-ray diffraction. The amount of calcium diglyceroxide (CaDG) began to increase rapidly after approximately 30 min, for both catalysts. This rapid increase in CaDG could be linked to ex-situ nuclear magnetic resonance studies which showed that the conversion of fish oil to biodiesel rapidly increased after 30 min. The key to the difference in activity of the two catalysts appears to be that the Ca3Al2O6:CaO composite maintains a high rate of CaDG formation for longer than CaO, although the initial formation rates and reaction kinetics are similar. The Ca for the CaDG mainly comes from the CaO phase. In addition, towards the end of the second test utilising the CaO catalyst (after 120 min), there is a rapid decrease in CaDG and a rapid increase in Ca(OH)2. This was not observed for the Ca3Al2O6:CaO catalyst and this is due to Ca3Al2O6 stabilising the CaO in the composite material. No additional calcium containing intermediate crystalline phases were observed during our in-situ experiment. Overall this specialised in-situ set-up has been shown to be suitable to monitor the phase evolution of heterogeneous crystalline catalysts during the triglycerides transesterification reaction, offering the opportunity to correlate the crystalline phases to activity, deactivation and stability. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - In recent years, biofuels have been receiving significant attention because of their potential for decreasing carbon emissions and providing a long-term renewable solution to unsustainable fossil fuels. Currently, lactones are some of the alternatives being produced. Many lactones occur in a range of natural substances and have many advantages over bioethanol. In this study, the oxidation of alpha-angelica lactone initiated by ground-state atomic oxygen, O(3P), was studied at 298, 550, and 700 K using synchrotron radiation coupled with multiplexed photoionization mass spectrometry at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL). Photoionization spectra and kinetic time traces were measured to identify the primary products. Ketene, acetaldehyde, methyl vinyl ketone, methylglyoxal, dimethyl glyoxal, and 5-methyl-2,4-furandione were characterized as major reaction products, with ketene being the most abundant at all three temperatures. Possible reaction pathways for the formation of the observed primary products were computed using the CBS–QB3 composite method. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The natural processes of interactions between aerosol particles in the ambient air through which they agglomerate is a vast area of chamber research and are inherent to many industries and are often inter-connected with transport engineering. Further improvement of symmetric methods for aerosol particle number and mass concentration reduction made it possible to create various synergic techniques. The study used a 1.9 TDI diesel internal combustion engine, which was supplied with diesel (D100) and second-generation biofuels (NExBTL100) with the EGR exhaust system on and off. Measurements were performed using a Bruel and Kjær “Type 9727” system for measurement of vibrations, a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) and an original agglomeration chamber. The three modes of particle size distributions were observed in the size range from 10 to 470 nm for both D100 and NExBTL100 fuels with and without the use of the EGR system. The application of 21.3 kHz frequency sound with SPL 144.1 dB changed the NExBTL100 generated aerosol particle number concentration but did not sufficiently affect the concentration of D100 emitted particles. The greatest agglomeration effect (21.7 + 10.0%) was observed in the range of extremely small NExBTL100 derived particles (10–70 nm) when used in combination with an EGR system. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - In this experimental study, the performance of the diesel engine was analyzed for bio-diesel derived from Calophyllum inophyllum. The impact of the addition of additives such as N‐oc-tanol and N‐butanol with Calophyllum inophyllum biodiesel has been assessed. Impact of the application of hybrid N‐octanol and N‐Butanol with biodiesel on emission profile used for the engine performance has also been demonstrated. Response surface analysis of alcohol additives‐biodiesel blend was performed separately in this study for the engine efficiency and emission profile. A com-bination of N‐octanol and N‐Butanol presented the highest brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and lowest carbon monoxide (CO) emission among the ternary blends of octanol. N‐Butanol‐biodiesel blend presented the lowest hydrocarbon (HC) emission among the blends of N‐butanol. N‐Octanol with 5 and 10% addition with biodiesel showed the lowest HC emissions among the blends of octanol. The response surface methodology (RSM) optimization revealed that the optimized thermal efficiency and emission were obtained at full load and minimum load, respectively. The addition of N‐ octanol hindered the emission at all loads, while N‐butanol reduced it at higher loads. A strong correlation between the load and alcohol additives on the engine performance and emission profile has been obtained using the RSM optimization approach. The R‐squared value obtained from the RSM was 0.92 and emission profile has been characterized. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The lock down engendered by COVID-19 pandemic has impacted positively on the environment through reduction of the emissions of green house gases, CO2, CO and other pollutants into the atmosphere below the pre-COVID-19 levels. There are fears that the gains made in the environment during COVID-19 may be frittered away as nations around the world make serious efforts to boost the COVID-19 recessed economy through massive investments in the sectors of the economy that are not environmentally friendly. This paper emphasizes on the essence of maintaining the COVID-19 pandemic era environmental impact levels in post COVID-19 era without retarding the efforts towards economic recovery. World health organization (WHO) data from six regions between April and August 2020 was evaluated. Emission levels during the COVID-19 lockdown were reviewed. The global renewable energy potentials were ascertained. The paper suggests that investment in renewable energy resources for various countries’ energy needs will help sustain the green and clean environment created by the COVID-19 lockdown even after COVID-19 era lockdown. Also, building large scale and distributed energy storage infrastructure and application of artificial intelligence would ensure security of energy supply and handle unstable nature of solar and wind energy. The COVID-19 lockdown significantly reduced air pollution. The application of biofuels to generate energy and power was found to significantly reduce air pollutant emissions similar to COVID-19 lockdown. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - As the environment is humiliated at a disturbing rate, most governments have persistent calls following global energy policies for the utilization of biofuels. This paper essentially examines the portrayal investigations of fatty acid methyl esters and fatty acid pentyl esters obtained from palm oil. The characterization studies such as gas chromatogram, mass spectrometry, and Fourier transformed infrared spectrometry have been performed to study biodiesel’s chemical composition. This article likewise shows biodiesel’s physiochemical properties and concentrates on biodiesel blends’ hypothetical combustion properties with Al2O3 nanoparticles. The spectroscopic investigations demonstrate the contiguity of eight methyl esters and five pentyl esters prevalently of palmitic acid, oleic acid, octanoic acid, and stearic acid. The esters’ nearness was additionally affirmed by the FTIR range, where the peaks in the scope of 1700 cm−1 to 1600 cm−1 can be observed. Looking at the thermophysical properties of the mixes with that of the base diesel fuel yielded the compromising results by giving the comparative density to that of the diesel fuel. The palm oil biodiesel’s calorific value is, by all accounts, diminished by 10% when contrasted with diesel fuel. The addition of the nanoparticles up to 1 g has raised the calorific value most closely to the diesel’s value. Correspondingly, the theoretical burning examinations have demonstrated the limit of biodiesel to go about as an option compared to consistent diesel in the conventional DI–CI engine. This article talks about the combustion attributes of the blend containing 60% diesel, 20% fatty acid methyl ester (FAME), and 20% fatty acid pentyl ester (FAPE) with aluminium oxide (Al2O3) nanoparticles at two distinctive concentrations. This article primarily concerns the inquiry of combustion criterion, such as in-chamber pressure variation, rate of heat release, start of combustion, end of combustion, and ignition delay for considered fuel blends when contrasted with neat diesel fuel in a four-stroke, direct-injection, single-cylinder diesel engine. The results showed a decrease in in-cylinder pressure at all loads of engine operation for biodiesel blends when compared with neat diesel, irrespective of the nanoparticle concentration. Biodiesel blends at all nanoparticle concentrations showed an increase in ignition delay compared with diesel fuels at all engine operation loads. The performance results show a slight deterioration in the engine’s thermal efficiency using biodiesel blends, irrespective of the nanoparticle concentration. Additionally, the emissions show a considerable fall in trends for all loads in contrast with diesel fuel. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This work investigates the effect of production scales (laboratory, bench, and pilot) by pyrolysis of Açaí (Euterpe oleracea Mart.) seeds at 450◦C and 1.0 atmosphere, on the yields of reaction products and acid value of bio-oils. The experiments were carried out in batch mode using a laboratory scale reactor of 143 mL, a bench scale reactor of 1.5 L, and a pilot scale reactor of 143 L (≈1:10:1000). The bio-oil was obtained in pilot scale, fractionated by distillation to produce biofuel-like fractions. The distillation of bio-oil was carried out in a laboratory column. The physical-chemistry properties (density, kinematic viscosity, acid value, and refractive index) of bio-oils and distillation fractions were determined. The qualitative analysis was determined by FT-IR and the chemical composition by GC-MS. The pyrolysis showed bio-oil yields from 4.37 to 13.09 (wt.%), decreasing with reactor volume. The acid value of bio-oils varied from 68.31 to 70.26 mg KOH/g. The distillation of bio-oil produced gasoline, light kerosene, and kerosene-like fuel fractions, and the yields were 16.16, 19.56, and 41.89 (wt.%), respectively. The physical-chemistry properties of distillation fractions increase with temperature. The FT-IR analysis of bio-oils and distillation fractions identified the presence of functional groups characteristic of hydrocarbons (alkenes, alkanes, aromatics, and aromatics rings) and oxygenates (carboxylic acids, ketones, esters, ethers, alcohols, phenols). The GC-MS identified 48.24 (area.%) hydrocarbons and 51.76 (area.%) oxygenates in the bio-oil produced in bench scale and 21.52 (area.%) hydrocarbons and 78.48 (area.%) oxygenates in the bio-oil produced in pilot scale. The gasoline-like fraction was composed by 64.0 (area.%) hydrocarbons and 36.0 (area.%) oxygenates, light kerosene-like fraction by 66.67 (area.%) hydrocarbons and 33.33 (area.%) oxygenates, and kerosene-like fraction by 19.87 (area.%) hydrocarbons and 81.13 (area.%) oxygenates. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Although cancer is traditionally considered a genetic disease, the epigenetic abnormal-ities, including DNA hypermethylation, histone deacetylation, and/or microRNA dysregulation, have been demonstrated as a hallmark of cancer. Compared with gene mutations, aberrant epigenetic changes occur more frequently, and cellular epigenome is more susceptible to change by environmental factors. Excess cancer risks are positively associated with exposure to occupational and environmental chemical carcinogens, including those from gasoline combustion exhausted in vehicles. Of note, previous studies proposed particulate matter index (PMI) as a measure for gasoline sooting tendency, and showed that, compared with the other molecules in gasoline, 1,2,4– Trimethylbenzene, 2–methylnaphthalene and toluene significantly contribute to PMI of the gasoline blends. Mechanistically, both epigenome and genome are important in carcinogenicity, and the genotoxicity of chemical agents has been thoroughly studied. However, less effort has been put into studying the epigenotoxicity. Moreover, as the blending of ethanol into gasoline substitutes for carcinogens, like benzene, toluene, xylene, butadiene, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, etc., a reduction of secondary aromatics has been achieved in the atmosphere. This may lead to diminished cancer initiation and progression through altered cellular epigenetic landscape. The present review summarizes the most important findings in the literature on the association between exposures to carcinogens from gasoline combustion, cancer epigenetics and the potential epigenetic impacts of biofuels. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Oleoresin is obtained via tapping of pine trees and as a by-product of Kraft process in the pulp industry. Because of its low production cost, it is an attractive source for biofuels. Oleoresin is composed mainly of rosin (around 80%, a solid mixture of isomeric abietic acids), and it cannot be used directly as fuel in engines. However, the methyl ester of rosin has lower boiling and melting points than rosin, and it is highly soluble in hydrocarbons. Esterification of rosin with methyl alcohol was evaluated over acid and basic heterogeneous catalysts in the presence of several solvents. In contrast to acid catalysts, basic materials were active in the reaction. In particular, a low-cost calcium-based material showed the best performance. A 55% conversion of rosin with complete selectivity to methyl esters was obtained with 40% wt. loading of the calcium-based material (respect to rosin), under mild conditions (atmospheric pressure, 64 °C and 3.5 h) and without solvent. Other catalysts, such as magnesium oxide, titanium dioxide, and alumina, achieved up to 30% conversion. Calcium carbonate and calcium hydroxide were the main phases in the calcium-based material, suggesting that the strength of basic sites can be an important property of the catalyst activity. A calcium-based material was used in five reaction cycles, obtaining a significant reduction in the activity attributed to the leaching of some phases of the catalyst. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Succulent halophyte Salicornia sp. was characterized to evaluate its suitability for biorefinery, as soil salinization is seen as a major agricultural issue and the demand for biofuel is increasing. Green fractionation of biomass approach was chosen, with liquid and solid fractions of the biomass considered separately. Soxhlet extractions were used to separate different biochemical groups from the pulp, and the lignocellulosic residue was hydrothermally pretreated, enzymatically hydrolyzed, mixed with an existing agricultural feedstock, and fed to black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) for sugars-to-lipids conversion. The ASTM approved route of hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) was applied using in silico study of processing BSFL lipids to sustainable jet fuel, using SuperPro Designer and Aspen HYSYS. Simulations and techno-economic assessment showed, with the applied process routes, inputs and production rates, the biorefinery process will be profitable in 7 years, with a biomass input flow rate of over 60 ton h−1 Salicornia sp. with decreasing payback time as the biomass input flow rate increases. Therefore, Salicornia sp. feedstock and sugars-to-lipids conversion method for biorefinery and liquid fuel production can function as a feasible biorefinery process with a normalized CO2-e reduction of HEFA-SPK of 95.5% compared to similar fossil fuels. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - The development of clean and sustainable biofuel generation from sustainable feedstock using an integrated process intensification approach like hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) is essential now. The current research is a 'first of its kind' where hydrodynamic cavitation is integrated with heterogeneous catalyst, i.e. TiO2, to prepare thumba methyl esters (TME). So far, no studies on biodiesel production using heterogeneous catalysts using HC are reported in the literature. Experiments were performed with an optimized orifice plate to investigate the effects of operating parameters viz., Thumba oil to methanol molar ratio (1:4–1:8), TiO2 concentration (1–1.4% by weight of oil), and operating temperature (50 °C to 70 °C). Maximum triglyceride conversion (71.8%) was obtained at thumba oil to methanol ratio of 1:6, TiO2 concentration of 1.2% weight percentage and operating temperature of 60 °C in hydrodynamic cavitation reactor within 1 h at 5 bar. The cavitational yield for HC was found to be 9.3 × 10−6 moles L/J, which was almost 27% higher than the value for the conventional approach (3.37 × 10−7 moles L/J). The experimental data fitted second-order reaction kinetics w.r.t limiting reactant, i.e., thumba oil and first-order w.r.t excess reactant, i.e., methanol. The pre-exponential factor (k0) and activation energy (E) of the alcoholysis reaction was found to be 82.26 L2 mol−2 min−1 and 15.44 kJ/mol, respectively. The thermodynamic analysis suggested that the alcoholysis of the thumba oil followed the endergonic reaction pathway. Thumba methyl ester (TME) synthesized via this intensified approach is a novel and energy-efficient method compared to the conventional method. © 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Decades have passed, facing the energy crisis and environmental pollution and researching various possible solutions to tackle them. The use of renewable sources and sustainable development processes is continuously under study to substitute conventional fossil fuels for environmental benefit. Amongst these, hydrogen is thought to be an ideal energy source with almost no hydrocarbon and carbon dioxide emissions and high energy output. Among the hydrogen production techniques, dark fermentation (DF) is a promising option for hydrogen production as it is less costly and has more energy recovery potential. The current study was designed to test the ability of kitchen waste, like potato peels, which is a common waste coming out of kitchens worldwide. The experiment demonstrates that the acidic pH of 4.5 at 40 °C yields maximum hydrogen in the bench-scale batch reactor. Hydrogen production from potato waste feedstock using sewage sludge inoculum has not been reported at this scale before. The actual results and their significance analysis by ANOVA also confirmed that fermentative hydrogen production from waste potato peels using sewage sludge inoculum is possible at a mesophilic temperature in a bench-scale batch fermenter. © 2021, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - An extended investigation on the application of blends between diesel oil and used cooking oil methyl esters (UCOME) was developed on an automotive turbocharged diesel engine. Two commercial diesel oils were considered as reference fuels, the first with the conventional content of biodiesel (7%), the second with an amount of 15%. Then, increasing levels of UCOME were added, on a volumetric basis (20%, 40%, 55 or 60%), to analyse the influence of biodiesel content on engine behaviour. Three part load engine operating conditions were selected for tests, measuring average engine parameters and indicated pressure diagrams. Their processing allowed to calculate the most important operating, energy and environmental engine quantities, rate of heat release and related combustion parameters. A proper management of the exhaust gas recirculation circuit, variable nozzle turbine and injection system was applied thanks to the availability of an open electronic control unit. An optimal UCOME content (40%) was identified, leading to highest values of brake thermal efficiency (with maximum increase around 5% referring to baseline fuels) and lowest levels of NOX emissions. For this blend, the analysis of combustion parameters outlined that the use of the renewable fuel corresponded to an enhanced premixed combustion phase, while reducing combustion duration. Lower local temperature levels, related to the decrease of Lower Heating Value, other local effects and biodiesel degree of unsaturation justify NOX reduction. Furthermore, soot emissions were always reduced when increasing biodiesel content, while combustion stability was not affected. All these outcomes were observed with and without EGR. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The energy sector in Brazil produces liquid biofuels as bioethanol and biodiesel. The most common technique to produce biodiesel is the transesterification of oils extracted from biomass. Rice processing generates grain bran, an agricultural residue. Brazil is one of the main countries that produce this grain. Therefore, the objective of this study was to produce a renewable biofuel using vegetable oil from grain bran via homogeneous basic transesterification. There are only three experimental studies reported in the literature on the production of biodiesel from rice bran oil via alkaline transesterification. Furthermore, the studies do not include results regarding biodiesel acidity, iodine, saponification and moisture content. Although potassium hydroxide (KOH) is the most commonly deployed alkaline catalyst in industrial biodiesel production, there are no reports regarding ethyl biodiesel production using rice bran oil with this catalyst. Therefore, this study applied a factorial arrangement in the experimental phase to produce ethyl biodiesel from rice bran oil using KOH as a catalyst on transesterification. The factors including reaction time, alcohol/oil molar ratio and amount of catalyst allowed to determine the best conditions for biodiesel production. To determine the viability of the biodiesel production, it was necessary to analyze the main parameters required by the national standards, which were kinematic viscosity, iodine index, acidity index, saponification index and moisture. All the yielded biodiesel were complied with the standards of ANP, ASTM and EN, except kinematic viscosity, which ranged from 8.061 to 22.791 mm2s-1. According to the conditions of the factorial arrangement, the calculated kinematic viscosity indicated the need to raise the proportion of catalyst and/or the molar ratio between ethanol and KOH The lower kinematic viscosity, around 8–9 mm2s-1, occurred with 1.5% catalyst and, in general, with molar ratio 9:1. These results suggest that future studies could explore the production of high-quality ethyl biodiesel using rice bran vegetable oil. According to the results, it represents a viable possibility to produce fully renewable and sustainable biodiesel within the socio-economic, environmental and agricultural context in Brazil. © 2021

AB  - Globally, biofuel is considered as the largest renewable energy source to substitute the petrochemical fuel and it is thus received a great amount of attention from both developed countries and developing countries. Among all the biofuels, biodiesel is strongly recommended as a promising alternative fuel for traditional internal combustion engines. Thermal conductivity is an essential transport property of fuel, and is vital in the flow and heat transfer process. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct the research associated with fuel's thermal conductivity. In this work, four binary fuel mixtures containing biodiesel components methyl caprate and ethyl caprate with n-undecane and n-tridecane were prepared respectively, and the liquid thermal conductivity of which were measured by the transient hot wire method system. The measurement was conducted at the temperature from 292 K to 362 K at atmospheric pressure. The experimental data reported here have an uncertainty of less than 2%. In addition, a correlation about the relationship between the liquid thermal conductivity with temperature and the esters’ concentration in different fuel blends has been correlated. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A new catalyst was synthesized from the South American Silver Croaker's stone − the Silver Croaker is a fish widely consumed in Brazil and the stone is a residue from the fish's head. The stone and the bio-based catalyst obtained from it were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, thermogravimetric analysis, surface area, and soluble alkalinity. It was confirmed that the stone is composed of aragonite (calcium carbonate) and the catalyst obtained by calcination of calcium oxide (CaO). The catalytic activity was evaluated by transesterification reactions. The process was optimized by surface response methodology based on Box – Behnken design. Methanol:oil molar ratio of 11.8, 5.33 wt% of catalyst, 175 min of reaction time, and 67.85 °C were identified as optimal conditions, reaching conversions close to 99% and ester content of 97.4%. The catalyst derived from silver croaker stone was reused 5 times while maintaining its high performance. Thus, a new application was given to this little-known waste, showing its potential as a catalyst in the synthesis of biodiesel. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper employs a partial equilibrium model to investigate the economic and environmental impact of commercial bioethanol production from biomass on the Malaysian agricultural markets. The results show that the palm oil mills can produce bioethanol commercially as the mills utilize the waste biomass created onsite and thus avoid the feedstock and hauling costs. Furthermore, by consuming biomass that recycles carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, a large bioethanol industry would help Malaysia reduce its GHG emissions and meet its GHG commitments in the Paris Agreement. With a potential to lead to greater forestation as landowners clear rainforests to enlarge oil palm plantations, such an industry could also be expected to expand the agricultural industry, reduce the agricultural prices, and raise agricultural employment. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the last decade, the use of renewable resources has increased significantly in order to reduce the energetic dependence on fossil fuels, as they have an important contribution to the global warning and greenhouse gasses effect. Because of that, research on biofuels has been increased in the last years as its characteristics of use match those of the conventional fuel's: solid biomass can be used instead of coals, and biodiesel could replace diesel. Research on solid biomass ignition properties has been considerably developed because of the amount of industrial accidents related to the treatment and use of solid biomass (self-ignition, dust explosions, etc.). On the other hand, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is becoming and important characterization technique as it can be used to determine a wide spectrum of properties, such as kinetics, composition, proximate analysis, etc. This research aims to combine thermal analysis and ignition properties, by using the TGA to obtain the elemental composition of lignocellulosic biomass and compare those results to Minimum Ignition Energy (MIE) values test output, so a relation between composition and MIE can be found. To achieve this aim, biomass samples from different origins have been used: oil palm wastes (empty fruit bunches, mesocarp fiber and palm kernel shell), agricultural wastes (straw chops) and forestry wastes (wood chips and wood powder). Also, raw materials and torrefied biomass were compared. The hemicellulose/cellulose ratio was calculated and compared to different flammability properties, finding out that the greater the ratio and the lower the onset temperature (temperature at which the pyrolysis reaction accelerates), the lower was the minimum ignition energy. From this basis it was possible to define “tendency areas” that grouped the samples whose MIE values were similar. Three tendency areas were found: high minimum ignition energy, medium minimum ignition energy, and low ignition energy. © 2021

AB  - Biodiesel production is becoming more and more important lately and different methods for production are searched. Thus, biodiesel can be obtained from different vegetable oils or animal fats using catalysts. The aim of this research was to prepare the Fe3O4/MnO2 nanocomposite and test them as catalyst to efficiently obtain biofuel like the final product from the oil obtained from seeds and grapes residues by microwave-assisted transesterification. Synthesized Fe3O4/MnO2 nanocomposites using chemically and biochemically (using plant extracts) route were characterized regarding size, crystallinity, composition, porosity and specific surface area. The analysis of the final results revealed that the samples chemically prepared show smaller sizes, specific surface area higher and porosity lower than the sample prepared using plant extract. The Fe3O4/MnO2 nanocomposites with the highest specific surface area from all prepared nanocomposites were tested for microwave-assisted transesterification studies. These nanocomposites, used as catalyst, determine an increasing reaction rate of the transesterification process thus being a promising route for biodiesel production. © 2021, Institute of Chemistry, Slovak Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Pyrolytic bio-oils derived from renewable organic wastes are credible second-generation biofuels. In crude form, bio-oils are inherently complex mixtures that largely limit their direct application as fuels and integration into existing petroleum infrastructure, without additional upgrading. Herein, we report on low-oxygenated biofuel production from milk processing sludge using a multistage process configuration. In the first stage, bio-oil yields were maximised (57.7%) under slow pyrolysis conditions at 450 °C. Bio-oils were enriched in aliphatic hydrocarbons (19–22% alkanes), (11–14% alkenes) and alkyl nitriles (57–63%), while aromatics remained low at &lt;2%. A relatively low bio-oil O/C molar ratio (0.08 to 0.1) and a correspondingly high HHV (40.8–41.8 MJ/kg) display possible fuel applications. Increasing pyrolysis temperatures (&gt;450 °C) was not beneficial to bio-oil yields, reduced hydrocarbon contents and increased heteroatoms (O, S, N). In the second stage, sulphided Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalysed hydroprocessing and distillation upgrading of bio-oils generated 100% C8-C22 saturated alkane distillates. With regard to fuel properties, oxygenation (0.26–0.89%), viscosities (4–6 mm2/s) and densities (ca.0.82 g/cm3) were comparable to standard diesel fuels. Resultant HHV (46.24 MJ/kg) and cetane index (69) of distillates produced from 450 °C bio-oils far exceeded those of diesel fuel standards, demonstrating direct fuel application and petroleum fuel compatibility. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Nowadays, the emissions from the diesel engines are focused lot to minimise the environmental pollutions in accordance with the emission standards. In this regard, biodiesels are found to be efficient for the diesel engines due to their higher energy contents and low exhaust emissions. Use of biofuel in association with diesel will be an efficient way for the cost-effective performance of the diesel engines with reduced pollutions. The COME is an efficient combustible oil, in which the diesel is blended at different proportions to identify their suitability in the diesel engines. In this regard, the properties of the COME-Diesel blends are determined and analysed for their influence on the combustion characteristics. To understand the performance and emission characteristics of blends, experiments are carried out on the variable compression ratio (VCR) engine keeping the blend, compression ratio, load, and speed as variables. The response surface methodology (RSM) used as a tool for designing and conducting the experiments according to the predetermined variables. The experimental sets generated are performed to determine the NO and HC emissions (response functions). The adequacy of the models is verified through ANOVA and through the p and F tests. The experimental design matrix is also used in training the artificial neural network (ANN) to develop the empirical models. The models from RSM and ANN are experimented and the results obtained from both the models are compared for their accuracy levels. Once the hypothesis is developed for the biodiesel and engine setup, the emission models will be used for the optimising the engine operating parameters and blends to minimise the pollutions from engine for wide operating conditions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - E10 is a blend of 10% bioethanol and 90% gasoline that can be used in the engines of most cars without causing damage. Currently for the E10 blend, Jamaica imports gasoline from Trinidad & Tobago and bioethanol from Brazil because the bioethanol production in Jamaica is at an early stage. However, the country has great potential for bioethanol production. In order to assess the environmental and economic feasibility of bioethanol in Jamaica, this paper presents an economic and environmental life cycle assessment for a case study in Jamaica in two different scenarios. The Baseline Scenario represents the use of E10 in the current conditions in which bioethanol comes from Brazil and gasoline from Trinidad & Tobago. Scenario I represents the use of E10 with bioethanol from Jamaica and gasoline from Trinidad & Tobago. The comparative environmental life cycle assessment revealed that the Baseline Scenario had better results than Scenario I in ten environmental categories. The economic assessment results in Scenario I were 7% higher than in the Baseline Scenario. Hence, the current context (Baseline Scenario) was identified as the scenario with the best economic performance. Therefore, the current situation in Jamaica (Baseline Scenario) scored better results than Scenario I from an environmental and an economical point of views. It is recommended to increase the bagasse cogeneration of Scenario I to lower the environmental impacts. To improve their productivity, it is necessary to improve the Jamaican sugar infrastructure by combining molasses and cane juice to produce bioethanol.

AB  - Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by incipient wet impregnation and tested in hydrodeoxygenation reactions for conversion of oleic acid to n-C17 alkanes at optimal conditions. The high conversion of 96.5% to renewable biodiesel (RD) is justified with the characterization results, showing that the catalyst has good texture properties, presence of metallic Pt evidenced by 2θ reflections and binding energies, as well as adequate dispersion of active phase and nanoparticle size. 20% and 40% mixtures of RD with diesel were used. At full load a slight decrease in potency was observed when using RD mixtures and comparing them with petrodiesel; fortunately, the RD mixtures showed significant reductions in air pollutants, RD40 achieved reductions greater than 22% for CO, HC, and near 43% in emissions of smoke when compared to diesel. © 2020 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Because there is still insufficient information about the effects of changing the fuel injection pressure with an alcohol–diesel blend on engine vibration and noise emission, in this study, the effects of changing the fuel injection system and the diesel–alcohol blend on engine vibration and noise emissions were investigated experimentally. The butanol was homogeneously mixed with conventional diesel fuel at a concentration of 10%. This blend was called B10D90. To investigate the effect of B10D90 on vibration and noise characteristics of a single-cylinder diesel engine, petroleum-based diesel fuel (D100) was selected as a reference fuel. The experimental studies on the single-cylinder diesel engine were carried out in five different engine speeds of 1600, 2000, 2400, 2800 and 3200 rpm under a constant load mode 80% and additionally three different injection pressures of 190 bar, 210 bar and 230 bar. The results showed that the addition of butanol in conventional diesel fuel generally increased engine vibration values at 190 bar, 210 bar and 230 bar fuel injection pressures. For all injection pressures, the differences between the noise level of the B10D90 blend and D100 appears to be about 2–3 dBA. This difference showed that the B10D90 blend has little effect on the noise emission of the engine. © 2020, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - This study aims to enhance the turbulence of direct injection (DI) diesel engine by modifying the inlet manifold design with an inclined nozzle-like provision angles of 30°, 60°, and 90° along with its regular intake system. Numerical analysis was carried out using the computational fluid dynamics package (STAR-CD libraries of es-ice) to study the flow field and combustion characteristic with the modified intake manifold geometries. The computational investigation was carried out for both single and double pass conditions at 1500 rpm under high-load operating condition (5.2 kW). The computational results showed that the velocity magnitude of modified single pass intake manifold increases by about 10% that results in higher turbulence even near the point of fuel injection. Through the modification in the inlet manifold, the combustion parameters such as in-cylinder pressure and in-cylinder temperature are increased as compared to the standard manifold for the same quantity of fuel injected per cycle. In summary, the 60° modified manifold with a single pass shows better combustion and emission characteristics compared to that of regular inflow manifolds due to the improvement in turbulence levels. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Non-edible jatropha oil was catalyzed by the sulfurated NiMo/activated clay catalyst to produce the second generation biodiesel. By the method of isovolumetric impregnation plus in-situ activation by CS2, a sulfurated NiMo/activated clay catalyst was prepared, and the structure and performance of the catalyst were studied by XRD, BET, Py-FTIR and NH3-TPD techniques. The effects of different reaction conditions such as reaction temperature, catalyst dosage, hydrogen pressure, reaction time on the reaction were investigated. The experimental results show that the optimal reaction conditions are as follows: the reaction temperature is 300 ℃, the catalyst mass fraction is 7.5%, the initial hydrogen pressure of the reaction is 3.5 MPa, and the reaction time is 60 min. Under these conditions, the conversion ratio of jatropha oil and the selectivity to C15-C18 reached 84.53% and 95.19%, respectively. The main components of optimal product were analyzed. With the sulfurated NiMo/activated clay, the second generation biodiesel with the main components of C15-C18 alkenes was obtained via the reactions of hydrogenation saturation, hydrodeoxygenation, hydrodecarbonylation and cracking. © 2021, Editorial Department of Journal of Hunan University.

AB  - The kinetic parameters for the pyrolysis of biomass of the pitch pine (Rigida pine P. Mill) were examined by thermogravimetric analysis in the temperature range 25 °C to 700 °C, in which the main decomposition was occurred from 250 °C to 400 °C. Pyrolysis of pitch pine has been investigated in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor. In this system, silica sand and nitrogen were used as the fluidizing bed material and fluidizing medium, respectively. The experimental was systemically performed on different temperature, fluidized velocity, and particle size of biomass. The optimum temperature condition at which the bio-oil yields reached the highest value (65.5%) was 500 °C. In addition, the higher heating values of bio-oils from pitch pine biomass were reached in the range 22 MJ/kg to 24 MJ/kg. Moreover, this bio-oil had high content of useful chemicals including such as levoglucosan, furfural, and guaiacol. The large amount of C5–C11 (gasoline fraction) produced make the pyrolyzed oil originating from pitch pine trees a promising biofuel candidate. © 2021 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry

AB  - A preliminary evaluation of the techno-economic feasibility of an industrial glycerol etherification process for bio-additives production has been carried out. The attention has been focused on the etherification reaction in presence of isobutylene (IB) or tert-butanol (TBA) in a batch reactor, catalyzed by an optimized heterogeneous system. Specifically, the Hyflon-based catalyst resulted more efficient and selective to desired products than commercial resin, limiting the competitive reactions of IB oligomerization and byproduct formation. In case of IB, a mixture of poly-ethers, suitable as oxygenated additives for diesel engines, containing very low amount of mono-tert-butylethers (<2 wt.%) was obtained in a single step. This allowed a simplification of the process without the need of separation units and a lower production cost with respect to other reference processes. When TBA was used and water was formed as byproduct, a permeoselective membrane was exploited improving the glycerol conversion and enhancing the poly-ethers productivity by continuous water removal. In fact, very high poly-ethers yield (>85%) was achieved under optimized reaction conditions. The analysis of the whole process demonstrated the techno-economic sustainability of the proposed routes, leading to a production price of glycerol poly-ethers of 1,14 USD/kg and 2,38 USD/kg, by using IB or TBA respectively. © 2021 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry

AB  - The global economy is shifting toward more sustainable sources of energy. The transportation sector is a remarkable example of this fact, where biofuels have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional fossil fuels. This work presents a techno-economic and environmental assessment of existing liquid fuels in hard-to-decarbonize sectors and their emerging renewable substitutes. The comparison focuses on fossil-based, biomass-derived, and plastic waste-sourced fuel alternatives that can be used in spark-ignition (gasoline) and compression-ignition (diesel) engines. Results for diesel substitutes prove the superior performance of plastic waste pyrolysis oil in terms of production cost reduction (−25% compared to diesel) and “well-to-tank” life cycle impact reduction (−54% human health, −40% ecosystems, −98% resources). Consequently, research and development toward the conversion of plastic waste into fuels should be extended to make the technology more accessible and robust in terms of fuel quality. On the contrary, the results for gasoline alternatives are not as conclusive: bioethanol and ethanol from plastic pyrolysis have a considerably lower impact on resource scarcity than gasoline (−80% and −35% respectively) and higher on the other two life cycle endpoint categories, but they have higher production costs compared to gasoline (+57% and +130% respectively). While blends of gasoline with pyrolysis-sourced ethanol can reduce the impact on human health and ecosystems, blends with bioethanol have a lower impact on resource scarcity and increase economic profitability. This allows fuel providers to offer tradeoff solutions in the form of blends based on their priorities. © Copyright © 2021 Pacheco-López, Lechtenberg, Somoza-Tornos, Graells and Espuña.

AB  - Recent works have established bio-based carboxylic acids as adaptable precursors to renewable biofuels and chemicals. However, the separation of carboxylic acids is a major energy and cost driver, accounting for 20-40% of the entire processing cost. Improved downstream separation technologies that reduce operating costs compared to conventional approaches are needed, particularly to enable bio-based commodity fuels and chemicals. Here, we combine techno-economic analysis (TEA) and an energy and environmental assessment with experimental results to compare weak-base adsorption (WBA) processes with the conventional strong ion exchange (IX) process for the recovery of the exemplary product, butyric acid. TEA indicates that WBA has the potential to reduce operating expenses from 34% to 6% relative to the selling price of butyric acid ($1.8 kg−1). Our energy analysis shows that the WBA process has 12.2-fold energy reduction and 9.2-fold GHG emission reduction compared to the conventional IX process. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

AB  - A series of multicyclic hydrocarbons were synthesized in high yield and under mild conditions from 2,5-hexanedione, cyclohexanone and cyclopentanone, on a scale of 200 g. Aldol products were obtained with conversions of 95% (2,5-hexanedione), 80-90% (cyclopentanone) and 75-80% (cyclohexanone), based on the consumption of starting materials. Cyclopentanone and cyclohexanone aldol condensations resulted in mixtures containing mainly bicyclic products (90%) as well as tricyclic analogs (&lt;10%). The 2,5-hexanedione aldol condensation produced 50% methylcyclopentenone (MCP) as expected and about 50% oligomers. Surprisingly, the complex heavy fraction after the removal of MCP contained mainly the products of Michael addition of MCP and only a minor fraction of the self-aldol condensation product of MCP. The hydrogenation-hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of cyclohexanone- and cyclopentanone-derived reactants with a nickel on alumina (Ni-Al2O3) catalyst at 250 °C and pressures between 800 and 1200 psig produced the expected saturated hydrocarbons with good recovery (80% and 76% respectively), with only small amounts of oxygenated residual starting materials remaining (&lt;2%). However, the HDO of the 2,5-hexanedione aldol mixture produced an equally complex mixture compared to its respective aldol/Michael addition product which contained unreacted oxygenates. All crude mixtures, only treated to remove water after HDO unless stated otherwise, were evaluated for their properties as potential compression-ignition fuels: distillation curve, derived cetane number, sooting tendency, lower heating value, density, flash point and cold flow properties. The results show the utility of these hydrocarbons as viable compression-ignition fuels or blendstocks, particularly the cyclopentanone- or cyclohexanone-derived products. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

AB  - 1-Octanol has gained interest as a chemical precursor for both high and low value commodities including fuel, solvents, surfactants, and fragrances. By harnessing the power from sunlight and CO2 as carbon source, cyanobacteria has recently been engineered for renewable production of 1-octanol. The productivity, however, remained low. In the present work, we report efforts to further improve the 1-octanol productivity. Different N-terminal truncations were evaluated on three thioesterases from different plant species, resulting in several candidate thioesterases with improved activity and selectivity toward octanoyl-ACP. The structure/function trials suggest that current knowledge and/or state-of-the art computational tools are insufficient to determine the most appropriate cleavage site for thioesterases in Synechocystis. Additionally, by tuning the inducer concentration and light intensity, we further improved the 1-octanol productivity, reaching up to 35% (w/w) carbon partitioning and a titer of 526 ± 5 mg/L 1-octanol in 12 days. Long-term cultivation experiments demonstrated that the improved strain can be stably maintained for at least 30 days and/or over ten times serial dilution. Surprisingly, the improved strain was genetically stable in contrast to earlier strains having lower productivity (and hence a reduced chance of reaching toxic product concentrations). Altogether, improved enzymes and environmental conditions (e.g., inducer concentration and light intensity) substantially increased the 1-octanol productivity. When cultured under continuous conditions, the bioproduction system reached an accumulative titer of >3.5 g/L 1-octanol over close to 180 days. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biomass pyrolysis is a promising approach for producing economic and environmentally friendly fuels and bioproducts. Biomass pyrolysis experiments show that feedstock properties have a significant impact on product yields and composition. Scientists are developing detailed chemical reaction mechanisms to capture the relationships between biomass composition and pyrolysis yields. These mechanisms can be computationally intensive. In this study, we investigate the use of a machine learning reduced order model (ROM) for assessing the costs and emissions of a pyrolysis biorefinery. We developed a Kriging-based ROM to predict pyrolysis yields of 314 feedstock samples based on the results of a detailed chemical kinetic pyrolysis mechanism. The ROM is integrated into a chemical process model for calculating mass and energy yields in a commercial-scale (2000 tonne/day) biorefinery. The ROM estimated biofuel yields of 65 to 130 gallons per ton of dry biomass. This results in biofuel minimum fuel-selling prices of $2.62-$5.43 per gallon and emissions of −13.62 to 145 kg of CO2per MJ. The ROM achieved an average mean square error of 1.8 × 10-20and a mean absolute error of 0.53%. These results suggest that ROMs can facilitate rapid feedstock screening for biorefinery systems. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Power-to-liquids are a class of liquid drop-in fuels produced from electricity and carbon dioxide as the primary process inputs, which have the potential to reduce transportation's climate impacts. We quantify the economic and life cycle environmental characteristics of four electrofuel technology pathways that rely on the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis but produce synthesis gas via different schemes: Power-to-liquid (PtL) via electrolysis and a reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction; PtL via co-electrolysis; gasification of biomass-toliquid (BtL); and a hybrid power- and biomass-to-liquid (PBtL) pathway. The results indicate that the hybrid PBtL pathway is the most environmentally and economically promising option for electrofuel production, with results highly dependent on input electricity source characteristics such as cost and emissions. The carbon intensities of electricity generation that must not be exceeded for electrofuels to have lower life cycle emissions than conventional diesel are 222, 116, and 143 gCO2e/kWh for PBtL, PtL electrolysis + RWGS, and PtL co-electrolysis, respectively. We characterize the PBtL pathway in more detail by combining spatially resolved data on biomass cultivation, electricity generation, and cost-optimized hydrogen production from renewable electricity in the United States (US). We find that the private emissions abatement cost for PBtL fuels varies between 740 and 2000 $/tCO2e, depending primarily on the location of fuel production. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The manufacturing of coffee, one of the most popular beverages globally, renders enormous amounts of by-products and wastes, which may trigger severe environmental issues if not treated appropriately. The coffee pulp, resulting from the wet processing of coffee, is the predominant by-product, with around 10 Mt annually produced worldwide. For the first time, this work addresses the hydrothermal treatment of coffee pulp to produce biofuels and platform molecules, scrutinising the influence of the processing conditions (temperature, pressure, reaction time and solid/water ratio) on the process. This strategy allowed the transformation of coffee pulp into bio-crude and hydrochar in different yields (10–26% and 10–42%, respectively), depending on the conditions. The bio-crude included a pool of alkanes, carboxylic acids, ketones, phenols and nitrogen species, with varying quantities of C (54–71 wt%), H (6–7 wt%), O (18–34 wt%) and N (3–5 wt%) and a calorific value shifting from 23 to 32 MJ/kg. The hydrochar contained different proportions of C (57–72 wt%), H (4–6 wt%), O (20–35 wt%) and N (2–3 wt%) and had a calorific value between 22 and 29 MJ/kg. Process optimisation showed that up to 45% of the coffee pulp could be simultaneously converted into energy-rich (29 MJ/kg), merchantable liquid (20% bio-crude) and solid (24% hydrochar) biofuels during the treatment of a 15 wt% coffee pulp suspension at 320 °C and 162 bar for 1 h. At the same time, a bio-crude with a high proportion of profitable phenolic derivatives (42%) can be attained in high yield (25%) when a 5 wt% suspension is treated at 280 °C and 120 bar for 2 h. These promising results, along with the bespoke nature of this hydrothermal treatment, are a landmark achievement for the economy and sustainability of coffee producer countries, thus representing a pioneering step change towards the sustainable management of early-stage coffee leftovers. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is the process in which biological compounds can be converted into biocrude diesel; various feedstocks, such as algae and wet biowaste, can be utilized. Almost 20 million dry tons of wet biowaste is deposited in U.S. municipal wastewaters annually. If recovered and converted into biodiesel, it can act as a massive source of renewable energy. Preliminary experiments on a diesel engine show that HTL fuel can achieve similar performance and emission levels to diesel. In order to further understand the influence of the HTL fuel properties, the HTL fuel and blends with diesel are observed in a constant volume chamber. Previously, 10% and 20% of the HTL fuel were blended with diesel by volume and demonstrated properties that roughly matched diesel in terms of combustion. In this study, 50% and 100% HTL fuel blends are tested on the same apparatus. It was discovered that the workability of HTL is almost the same as that of diesel and is less sensitive to ambient temperatures. When the ambient temperature is reduced from 1200 K to 800 K, the change ratio of ignition delay is only 62% of diesel. By analyzing the combustion process, it can be seen that there is no need to make major modifications to the engine control strategy if HTL fuel is applied to diesel engines. However, under low temperature and low oxygen conditions, the soot luminosity peak of HTL100 is 3.12 times than that of diesel. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Soil serves many important ecological functions and is an integral part of our existence as a society. However, concerns for soil health are growing globally, in part due to the negative impacts of agricultural management on soil resources. The production of perennial bioenergy crops on marginal land in row-crop production systems is one solution that could improve land-use efficiency and address the sustainability of cropland management. Because the relationship between crop management and the environment is complex, more research is needed to evaluate the potential benefits perennial bioenergy crop production has on soil health, as well as other ecosystem services. In this study, shrub willow buffers were strategically integrated into a corn-soybean cropping system with the main objective of reducing nitrate-N leaching from grain crop production while producing biomass for bioenergy. Two buffer systems (defined by landscape positions) were included for comparison, one on marginal land with exposure to nitrate-N leaching from upslope grain (southern plots) and one on fertile soils with less nitrate-N leaching potential (northern plots). Evaluation of soil (chemistry, bulk density, microbial community) and shrub willow vegetation properties (fine roots, leaf litter decomposition, and nutrient uptake dynamics), showed that landscape position plays an important role in (1) the dynamics of soil chemical properties, (2) shrub willow's influence and productivity, and (3) the provision of additional ecosystem services such as reductions in nitrous oxide emissions and nitrate-N leaching. In addition, the combination of crop type and landscape position (N-grain, N-willow, S-grain, and S-willow) influenced the species composition of the soil microbial community, resulting in unique and identifiable communities. These results highlight the potential application of shrub willow buffers for ecosystem service provision and support of ecosystem processes; however, understanding the relationship between the microbial community, crop type, and landscape is important for understanding the sustainability of the design. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Furfural acetals with high octane value, high calorific value and high oxidation resistance are considered promising biofuels or fuel precursors with huge potential demand. However, there are few studies on efficient scalable catalyst systems, including continuous-flow catalyst systems, for their preparation. In this work, TiO2 nanoparticles supported on exfoliated montmorillonite, with strong Lewis acid sites and abundant accessible Brønsted acid sites, is used to catalyze the acetalization reactions of biomass-derived furfural and alcohols. Low dosage of the catalyst made the reaction reach equilibrium in a very short time (TOF=690–1305 min−1) at room temperature with the acetal as the only product. In continuous-flow reactions, the catalyst showed a stable product output with conversion close to that for the batch reaction with a short catalyst-reactant contact time of 150 s. Contrast experiments revealed that both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites on the catalyst were indispensable for maximizing the catalytic performance, and simultaneously activating both furfural and alcohol on the adjacent Lewis and Brønsted acid sites was proposed to be responsible for the high catalytic performance. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - The United States of America and Brazil are the world’s first and second-largest biofuels producers. The United States (U.S.) has dedicated a significant portion of agricultural land for crops to produce biodiesel, while Brazil has been using sugar cane as raw material to produce ethanol. To make the world’s top producers in global biofuel markets, various institutions in each country have played significant roles. These institutions include renewable energy legislators, bioenergy policymakers, and energy ministries of their governments. This study delineates the historical role of these institutions responsible for the sustainable development of biofuel industries in both countries. It also provides an overview of economic impacts as a result of institutional decisions. The study reveals that systematic legislations and sustainable and robust renewable energy policies of government institutions have helped the U.S. and Brazil to boost their bio-economies. As both countries intend to keep expanding their biofuel productions, the role of key government institutions is vital in the sustainability of biofuels. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - In order to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy technologies such as wind power and solar photovoltaic power systems have recently become more widespread. However, Japan as a nation faces high reliance on imported fossil fuels for electricity generation despite having great potential for further renewable energy development. The focus of this study examines untapped geographical locations in Japan’s northern most prefecture, Hokkaido, that possess large wind power potential. The possibility of exploiting this potential for the purpose of producing green hydrogen is explored. In particular, its integration with a year-round conversion of Kraft lignin into bio-oil from nearby paper pulp mills through a near critical water depolymerization process is examined. The proposed bio-oil and aromatic chemical production, as well as the process’ economics are calculated based upon the total available Kraft lignin in Hokkaido, including the magnitude of wind power capacity that would be required for producing the necessary hydrogen for such a large-scale process. Green hydrogen integration with other processes in Japan and in other regions is also discussed. Finally, the potential benefits and challenges are outlined from an energy policy point-of-view. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Microalgal biomass has the capacity to accumulate relatively large quantities of triacylglyc-erides (TAG) for the conversion of methyl esters of fatty acids (FAME) which has made microalgae a desirable alternative for the production of biofuels. In the present work Verrucodesmus verrucosus was evaluated under autotrophic growth conditions as a suitable source of oil for biodiesel production. For this purpose BG11 media were evaluated in three different light:dark photoperiods (L:D; 16:08; 12:12; 24:0) and light intensities (1000, 2000 and 3000 Lux) in a photobioreactor with a capacity of three liters; the evaluation of the microalgal biomass was carried out through the cell count with the use of the Neubauer chamber followed by the evaluation of the kinetic growth parameters. So, the lipid accumulation was determined through the lipid extraction with a Soxhlet system. Finally, the fatty acid profile of the total pooled lipids was determined using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). The results demonstrate that the best conditions are a photoperiod of 12 light hours and 12 dark hours with BG11 medium in a 3 L tubular photobioreactor with 0.3% CO2, 25◦C and 2000 Lux, allowing a lipid accumulation of 50.42%. Palmitic acid is identified as the most abundant fatty acid at 44.90%. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The use of biofuel is one method for limiting the harmful impact of diesel engines on the environment. It is also a way of gradually becoming less dependent on the depleting petroleum resources. New resources for producing biodiesel are currently being sought. The authors produced esters from animal fat waste, obtaining a fuel that can power diesel engines and identifying a way to utilise unnecessary waste. The animal fat methyl ester (AME) was produced using a reactor constructed for non‐industrial ester production. The aim underlying this paper was to determine whether a diesel engine can be fuelled with AME biodiesel and to test this fuel’s impact on exhaust gas composition and fuel consumption. Fuelling a Perkins 1104D‐44TA engine with AME biodiesel led to a reduction in the smoke opacity of the exhaust gas as well as in carbohydrate, particulate matter, and carbon monoxide concentrations. The carbon dioxide concentrations were similar for biodiesel and diesel fuel. Slight increases in nitrogen oxides concentrations and brake‐specific fuel consumption were found for AMEs. An engine can be fuelled with AME biodiesel, but it is necessary to improve its low‐temperature properties. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The negative effect of liquid and gaseous fuel combustion is toxic gases (i.e., carbon and nitrogen oxides NOx) and particulate matter (PM) formation. The content of harmful and toxic com-ponents of exhaust gases is strongly dependent on the quality and type of burnt fuel. Experimental research is required to verify the use of current technical and technological solutions for the production of electricity on farms, using various types of conventional fuels and biofuels. The aim of the current research was to comprehensively verify the use of commonly available fuels and biofu-els without adapting the internal combustion engine. Gaseous fuels—propane-butane mixture (LPG), compressed natural gas (CNG) and biogas (BG)—were added to liquid fuels—methyl esters of higher fatty acids (RME) and diesel fuel (DF)—in six different power configurations to evaluate the effect on the emission of toxic gases: carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxide (NO), nitric dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM), and the efficiency of fuel conversion. The use of RME in various configurations with gaseous fuels increased the emission of oxides and reduced the emission of PM. Increasing the share of LPG and CNG significantly increased the level of NO emissions. The use of gaseous fuels reduced the efficiency of the generator, particularly in the case of co-firing with DF. For medium and high loads, the lowest decrease in efficiency was recorded for the RME configura-tion with BG. Taking into account the compromise between individual emissions and the configu-ration of RME with BG, the most advantageous approach is to use it in power generators. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Energy crisis in the world motivates countries to hire new and renewable energies. One of the main and valuable renewable sources of energy is agricultural waste. This is widely disposed of through the world during the harvest, packing, and transportation. In many countries, agricultural waste is considerably weighty. Nonetheless, most of that is used for animal feed or herbal fertilizer and no useful value is added. Despite its location in an arid region, Iran produces various citrus, cereals, and vegetables in high tonnage. The waste of the agricultural product, especially those disposed of by the food processing industries, such as fruit juice factories, remains also useless. The potential of the residues to extract biofuel is investigated in the current experimental study. Six samples of abundant agricultural products in Iran are chosen: sugarcane, grape, potato, orange peel, date, and mulberry. The processes of pretreatment, hydrolysis, and fermentation are performed and the extracted juice is directed to the distiller to gather bioethanol. To evaluate the distilled juice purity, a gas chromatography test is carried out. It is shown that date and mulberry can produce a maximum of 29.5 and 23 ml (ethanol)/100 g (dry waste) as the most efficient agricultural products. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Green house effect and ozone layer depletion due continuous environmental pollution from fossil fuel has speed up the quest for search of alternative energy fuel. In recent year, biofouls has attracted much attention as a reliable substitute to fossil fuel. The objective of this study was to evaluate and characterize biofuel produced from Egusi vegetable oil by applying standard method of transesterification. This study was carried out at Processing and Storage Engineering Departmental (PSED) laboratory of National Centre for Agricultural Mechanization (NCAM), Ilorin Kwara State, Nigeria. The results of the proximate characterization of the produced Egusi vegetable oil shows crude protein, crude fibre, ether extract, moisture content, ash content and carbohydrate composition of 20.6%, 13.3%, 50.6%, 4.3%, 3.0% and 8.2% respectively. The transesterification of Egusi vegetable oil in this study yielded 63.7% of methyl ester. The characterization results of the biofuel produced shows kinematic viscosity, density, cloud point, flash point, pour point, fire point, acid value, iodine value, saponification and specific gravity values of 4.6, 0.714, 5, 210,-3, 250, 0.54, 0.69, 0.26 and 0.915 respectively. The results were compared with the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM 6751) for standard. Information from this study will expand the scope of knowledge on the search for an alternative fuel to fossil fuel. Also, this will serve as a guide in both policy and management of global warming. © 2021, Int. Comm. of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biofuels as alternatives to fossil-based conventional fuels have been considered as a get-away strategy that could partially address some of the environmental concerns. The combustion of biomass-derived liquid fuels such as biodiesel has gained significant importance in practical combustion systems such as diesel engines. The aims of this study were to investigate combustion, performance, and exhaust emissions by using Moringa oleífera biodiesel-diesel blend (BIO) as fuel substitutes for a four-stroke single cylinder engine with direct injection. The physicochemical properties of Moringa oleífera methyl esters and its blend fully matched with the ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 standards. The experimental results revealed an earlier start of combustion and shorter ignition delay for BIO as compared to diesel, whereas the general profile of the rate of heat release diagram is quite similar for both fuels. Engine performance test results showed an increase of the brake specific fuel consumption and the exhaust gas temperature when BIO was used; however, brake thermal efficiency decreased. The carbon monoxide (CO) emission for BIO was found 13.08% lower than diesel fuel, but NOx concentrations slightly increased by 7.20%. The Moringa oleífera biodiesel-diesel blend (BIO) can replace diesel fuel without modifying engines to reduce dependency on fossil fuels. © 2021 Asociacion de Quimicos del Instituto Quimico de Sarria.

AB  - In the present work, effect of hydrothermal temperature from 120 to 160 °C on TiO2 physicochemical properties as well as its photocatalytic activity towards biodiesel production using waste cooking oil (WCO) was investigated. TiO2 was synthesized via hydrothermal method using Titanium butoxide, Ti(OBu)4 as the precursor and nitric acid, HNO3 as the peptizing agent. Next, the synthesized photocatalyst was dried at 60 °C for 24 h and later calcined at 400 °C for 2 h. The synthesized TiO2 was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Burnauer- Emmet- Teller (BET) to determine their crystallinity and textural properties. Results showed that all synthesized TiO2 have a mixture of anatase and rutile phase and N2 adsorption- desorption isotherm for all catalyst possess Type IV isotherm according to IUPAC classification with hysteresis loop of type H1. Then, all the synthesized catalysts were tested for biodiesel production using esterified waste cooking oil under visible light irradiation for 1 h and 10 min. Percentage of fatty acid methyl ester (FAMEs) present in the synthesized biodiesel was determined using gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (GC-FID). The synthesized catalyst (T24_160) showed a good photocatalytic activity as the percentage of biodiesel yield was higher (3.41%) compared to the other catalyst. © 2021 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

AB  - The ambitious CO2 emission reduction targets for the transport sector set in the Paris Climate Agreement require low-carbon energy solutions that can be commissioned rapidly. The production of gasoline, kerosene, and diesel from renewable methanol using methanol-to-olefins (MTO) and Mobil’s Olefins to Gasoline and Distillate (MOGD) syntheses was investigated in this study via process simulation and economic analysis. The current work presents a process simulation model comprising liquid fuel production and heat integration. According to the economic anal-ysis, the total cost of production was found to be 3409 €/tfuels (273 €/MWhLHV), corresponding to a renewable methanol price of 963 €/t (174 €/MWhLHV). The calculated fuel price is considerably higher than the current cost of fossil fuels and biofuel blending components. The price of renewable methanol, which is largely dictated by the cost of electrolytic hydrogen and renewable electricity, was found to be the most significant factor affecting the profitability of the MTO-MOGD plant. To reduce the price of renewable fuels and make them economically viable, it is recommended that the EU’s sustainable transport policies are enacted to allow flexible and practical solutions to reduce transport-related emissions within the member states. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - This paper focuses on the evaluation of the fuel properties of Fischer–Tropsch diesel blends with conventional diesel. Incorporating this advanced fuel into conventional diesel production will enable the use of waste materials and non-food materials as resources, while contributing to a reduction in dependence on crude oil. To evaluate the suitability of using Fischer–Tropsch diesel, cetane number, cetane index, CFPP, density, flash point, heat of combustion, lubricity, viscosity, distillation curve, and fuel composition ratios using multidimensional GC × GC-TOFMS for different blends were measured. It was found that the fuel properties of the blended fuel are comparable to conventional diesel and even outperform conventional fuel in some parameters. All measurements were performed according to current standards, thus ensuring the repeatability of measurements for other research groups or the private sector. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Biofuels are important additives to conventional fuels in combustion engines of the transport sector, as they reduce atmospheric emissions and promote environmental-friendly production chains. The mechanical and thermal performance of a PT6A-61A engine on a test bench of the Colombian Air Force operating with blends of JETA-1 and Biodiesel up to 25% volume values of substitution is evaluated in this work. Experimental results show that blends are operationally reliable up to 15% volume content. In that range, the engine operation is not compromised in terms of response variables. Moreover, experimental properties of fuel blends show that the freezing point—which is the most critical variable, does not comply with aeronautical regulations. The system dynamics are subject to several variations in the test parameters, which mainly affected fuel flow, Inter-Turbine Temperature (ITT), and engine performance. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is performed over the experimental results to quantify possible disturbances on the bench measurements. This is based on the fact that the study is restrained to stationary test bench conditions. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Biodiesel has been receiving increasing attention because of its fuel properties and compatibility with petroleum-based diesel fuel. Therefore, it is necessary to measure the engine performance and exhaust emissions of engines using petroleum-based diesel fuel and biodiesel blends. The main goal of this study is to investigate the capability of several machine learning (ML) techniques including artificial neural network (ANN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), general regression neural network (GRNN), radial basis function (RBFN), and support vector regression (SVR) for predicting performance and exhaust emissions of the diesel engine fuelled with biodiesel blends. The case application is a Hyundai D4CB 2.5 engine together with B0, B10 and B20 biodiesel blends which are popularly used in Vietnam. The engine process parameters are used as inputs and the outputs include predicted torque and NOx emission. Different predicting models based on ML techniques are developed and validated. The performance of each model is evaluated and compared using root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean absolute error (MAE), and correlation coefficient (R). The obtained results indicate that SVR can be used to develop the model for the prediction of performance and exhaust emissions. The study also provides a better understanding of the effects of engine process parameters on performance and exhaust emissions. © 2021 Technoscience Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - In internal combustion engines, a significant share of the fuel energy is wasted via the heat losses. This study aims to understand the heat losses and analyze the potential of the waste heat recovery when biofuels are used in SI engines. A numerical model is developed for a single-cylinder, four-stroke and air-cooled SI engine to carry out the waste heat recovery analysis. To verify the numerical solution, experiments are first conducted for the gasoline engine. Biofuels including pure ethanol (E100), E15 (15% ethanol) and E85 (85% ethanol) are then studied using the validated numerical model. Furthermore, the exhaust power to heat loss ratio (Qex/Qht) is investigated for different compression ratios, ethanol fuel content and engine speed to understand the exhaust losses potential in terms of the heat recovery. The results indicate that heat loss to brake power ratio (Qht/Wb) increases by the increment in the compression ratio. In addition, increasing the compression ratio leads to decreasing the Qex/Qht ratio for all studied fuels. According to the results, there is a direct relationship between the ethanol in fuel content and Qex/Qht ratio. As the percentage of ethanol in fuel increases, the Qex/Qht ratio rises. Thus, the more the ethanol in the fuel and the less the compression ratio, the more the potential for the waste heat recovery of the IC engine. Considering both power and waste heat recovery, the most efficient fuel is E100 due to the highest brake thermal efficiency and Qex/Qht ratio and E85, E15 and E00 (pure gasoline) come next in the consecutive orders. At the engine speeds and compression ratios examined in this study (3000 to 5000 rpm and a CR of 8 to 11), the maximum efficiency is about 35% at 5000 rpm and the compression ratio of 11 for E100. The minimum percentage of heat loss is 21.62 happening at 5000 rpm and the compression ratio of 8 by E100. The minimum percentage of exhaust loss is 35.8% happening at 3000 rpm and the compression ratio of 11 for E00. The most Qex/Qht is 2.13 which is related to E100 at the minimum compression ratio of 8. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - It was obtained that the yeast Torulaspora globosa VKPM Y-953 is suitable for the production of biodiesel fuel. Zinc plays an important regulatory role in the metabolism of the studied strain. The study of the growth parameters and the fatty acid profile of the yeast T. globosa showed that the limitation of its growth by ethanol, at different concentrations of zinc in the medium, considerably influences the chemical composition and the energy content of yeast cells, but not their yield by weight (Yx/s). The increased concentrations of zinc in the medium, in combination with the yeast growth limitation by ethanol, elevated the content of lipids in the cells by 28% and diminished the content of proteins by 14%. At the same time, the limitation of yeast growth by zinc decreased Yx/s and energy (ηX/S) by 2.6 and 3.1 times, respectively. In this case, the content of lipids in cells fell by 72%, while that of proteins rose by 65%. The fatty acid profile of the T. globosa cells was used to estimate the main characteristics of biodiesel (iodine value, cetane number, density, and kinematic viscosity). The biomass of T. globosa can also be used in agriculture as a feed additive rich in essential amino acids. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Jojoba oil biofuel is a potential alternative to diesel fuel with attractive properties, but its flow behavior under the operating conditions of a diesel engine still needs to be clarified. In this study, the rheological properties of the jojoba biofuel are presented in assessment with diesel fuel to experimentally evaluate both their flow behaviors at different operating temperatures. A Fann-type coaxial cylinder viscometer was employed. The shear stress of the tested biofuel rises considerably with the shear rate in a marginally nonlinear manner on a logarithmic scale. Rheograms indicate that the flow behavior decreases gradually and considerably in the temperature range of 30–90◦C. The viscosity of the jojoba oil biofuel declines considerably with the decreasing applied shear rate and temperature. Based on the experimental results, a suitable model is developed for predicting the viscosity characteristics of the tested biofuel during the heating and cooling cycles of a diesel engine. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Currently, India utilizes an enormous amount of fossil fuels and a major quantity of fossil fuels are imported from other countries. It’s a giant load on the Indian Economy. The burning of fossil fuels causes global warming. Carbon neutral, renewable fuels are essential for environmental protection and it’s economically sustainable for India. Biofuels attention day by day due to a rise in energy demands and environmental concerns. Biodiesel produced from algal oil a possible renewable and carbon-neutral substitute to fossil fuels. The feasibility of the algal-based biodiesel industry depends on the selection of adequate species regarding commercial oil yields and oil quality. Present research work to bioprospecting and screening of 19 algal and blue-green algal species, the oil percentage and the fatty acid profiles, used for analyzing the biodiesel fuel properties. Oil from Tolypothrix phyllophila algal strain and compared it with another eighteen algal and blue-green algal strains from different literature. Tolypothrix phyllophila algal strain contains approximately 12.6% lipid on a dry weight basis. We also compared the FAME profile of 19 algal and blue-green algal strains and calculated and compared the fuel properties such as cetane number, Iodine Value, etc. of the biodiesel derived from these algal and blue-green algal oils based on chain length and saturation. We also investigated the 19 algal and blue-green algal fatty acid profiles and its suitability for biodiesel production and strains selection through PROMETHEE (Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations) and GAIA (geometrical analysis for interactive aid) analysis. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Biofuels represent an energy option to mitigate polluting gases. However, technical problems must be solved, one of them is to improve the combustion process. In this study, the geometry of a piston head for a diesel engine was redesigned. The objective was to improve the combustion process and reduce polluting emissions using biodiesel blends as the fuel. The methodology used was the mechanical engineering design process. A commercial piston (base piston) was selected as a reference model to assess the piston head’s redesign. Changes were applied to the profile of the piston head based on previous research and a new model was obtained. Both models were evaluated and analyzed using the finite element method, where the most relevant physical conditions were temperature and pressure. Numerical simulations in the base piston and the new piston redesign proposal presented similar behaviors and results. However, with the proposed piston, it was possible to reduce the effort and the material. The proposed piston profile presents adequate results and behaviors. In future, we suggest continuing conducting simulations and experimental tests to assess its performance. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This study performed technoeconomic and life-cycle analyses to assess the economic feasibility and emission benefits and tradeoffs of various biofuel production pathways as an alternative to conventional marine fuels. We analyzed production pathways for (1) Fischer-Tropsch diesel from biomass and cofeeding biomass with natural gas or coal, (2) renewable diesel via hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids from yellow grease and cofeeding yellow grease with heavy oil, and (3) bio-oil via fast pyrolysis of low-ash woody feedstock. We also developed a new version of the Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation (GREET) marine fuel module for the estimation of life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) and criteria air pollutant (CAP) emissions of conventional and biobased marine fuels. The alternative fuels considered have a minimum fuel selling price between 2.36 and 4.58 $/heavy fuel oil gallon equivalent (HFOGE), and all exhibit improved life-cycle GHG emissions compared to heavy fuel oil (HFO), with reductions ranging from 40 to 93%. The alternative fuels also exhibit reductions in sulfur oxides and particulate matter emissions. Additionally, when compared with marine gas oil and liquified natural gas, they perform favorably across most emission categories except for cases where carbon and sulfur emissions are increased by the cofed fossil feedstocks. The pyrolysis bio-oil offers the most promising marginal CO2 abatement cost at less than $100/tonne CO2e for HFO prices >$1.09/HFOGE followed by Fischer-Tropsch diesel from biomass and natural gas pathways, which fall below $100/tonne CO2e for HFO prices >$2.25/HFOGE. Pathways that cofeed fossil feedstocks with biomass do not perform as well for marginal CO2 abatement cost, particularly at low HFO prices. This study indicates that biofuels could be a cost-effective means of reducing GHG, sulfur oxide, and particulate matter emissions from the maritime shipping industry and that cofeeding biomass with natural gas could be a practical approach to smooth a transition to biofuels by reducing alternative fuel costs while still lowering GHG emissions, although marginal CO2 abatement costs are less favorable for the fossil cofeed pathways. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is the most abundant renewable and sustainable carbon source with great potential for the synthesis of biofuels. In this study fibrous nano-silica (FNS) supported heteropoly acid-functionalized ionic liquid (FNS-ILHPW) catalyst was synthesized for the cross-condensation reaction of 2-MF and 5-MF to produce C16 fuel precursor. 2-MF and 5-MF were utilized in a stoichiometric ratio. The prepared catalysts were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The obtained result from the XRD and FTIR suggests that HPW was present as charge compensating anion (H2PW12O40−) of the IL. NH3-TPD analysis revealed that FNS-ILHPW retains moderate to strong acid sites. FNS-ILHPW shows higher conversion of the reactants and selectivity to C16 (2, 2′,2″-methylidenetris[5-methylfuran]) fuel precursor. 95% yield of C16 fuel precursor was obtained over the optimized reaction conditions. The excellent activity can be attributed to the coexistence of HPW, which provides the catalytically active sites, IL groups, which served as anchors of HPW onto the support, and FNS, which improves dispersion of the active sites and accessibility of the reactant molecules through its fibers. The effects of the reaction conditions on the final yield and the carbon balance of the reaction were studied. Furthermore, the catalyst can be effortlessly recovered and reused without appreciable loss of activity. The post reaction characterizations of the spent catalyst show no significant change from the fresh catalyst. © 2021, The Korean Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Potential alternative fuels that can mitigate environmental pollution from gas turbine engines (due to steep growth in the aviation sector globally) are getting significant attention. Spray behavior plays a significant role in influencing the combustion performance of such alternative fuels. In the present study, spray characteristics of Kerosene-based fuel (Jet A-1) and alternative aviation fuels such as butyl butyrate, butanol, and their blends with Jet A-1 are investigated using an air-blast atomizer under different atomizing air-to-fuel ratios. Phase Doppler Interferometry has been employed to obtain the droplet size and velocity distribution of various fuels. A high-speed shadowgraphy technique has also been adopted to make a comparison of ligament breakup characteristics and droplet formation of these alternative biofuels with that of Jet A-1. An effort is made to understand how the variation in fuel properties (mainly viscosity) influences atomization. Due to the higher viscosity of butanol, the SMD is higher, and the droplet formation seems to be delayed compared to Jet A-1. In contrast, the lower viscosity of butyl butyrate promotes faster droplet formation. The effects of the blending of these biofuels with Jet A-1 on atomization characteristics are also compared with that of Jet A-1. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - The use of biofuel has been researched and announced by scientists to bring benefits in terms of environmental protection. However, studies continue to be conducted to achieve stable results and confirm biofuels as an effective alternative fuel for internal combustion engines. In this study, the fuel used is biodiesel derived from fish oil and conventional diesel fuel. Specifically, the test fuel is conventional diesel mixed with fish oil biodiesel in different ratios, including B0, B10, B20, B30, B40, and B50 (respectively 0%, 10%, 20%, 30% 40%, and 50% biodiesel in the mixture). Research was carried out by both simulation (from B0 to B50) and experiment (from B0 to B30) on a single cylinder common rail diesel engine. Test modes were at 25%, 50%, and 75% load respectively at maximum torque (at 1400 revolutions per minute (rpm)) and minimum fuel consumption (at 2200 rpm). Compared with B0, the average reduction in brake power of the biodiesel decreased relative to the proportion of biodiesel in the fuel mixture. Specific fuel consumption of the brakes (BSFC) and NOx emissions increased with decreasing emissions of smoke, hydrocarbon (HC), and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions when the biodiesel ratio increased. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - A significant obstacle to utilize biodiesel fuel for automotive engine applications is its poor oxidative stability. In the present work, oxidation and spray characteristics of Karanja biodiesel stored for one year are studied. The fuel physical properties that influence the spray characteristics, viz. density, kinematic viscosity, and surface tension, are increased by 0.38%, 12.74%, and 3.95%, respectively, after a one-year storage period. The macroscopic spray characteristics of fresh and aged Karanja biodiesels are compared with that of diesel. The spray penetration length, spray cone angle, and the projected spray area are measured at chamber pressures of 20, 30, and 40 bar and injection pressures of 300, 600, and 900 bar. The results showed reduced mass flow rate at lower injection pressures with fresh and aged biodiesels than diesel. At 300 bar injection pressure, spray penetration length is longer with diesel during the initial injection period, but later the spray slows down. There are no appreciable differences in the spray penetration length and the spray cone angle between diesel, fresh, and aged biodiesels at all the injection pressures. The projected spray area is higher for diesel than biodiesels indicating a denser spray with biodiesels. The study concludes that although biodiesel's long-term storage results in variations in physical and chemical properties, there are no significant variations in the macroscopic spray characteristics. Analysis of atomization characteristics of fresh and aged biodiesels also revealed similar results. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A major focus of algal biofuel research is on maximizing the formation of the energy-containing compounds (i.e., carbohydrates, proteins, fatty acids, and lipids) during algal growth. Measurements were carried out to investigate the thermochemical character of Chlorella sp. and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Thermogravimetric analysis was carried out to identify the algal chemical decomposition transitions (stages) from the sample mass loss with temperature, and results were compared to values published in the literature for different algal species. Laser-driven calorimetry was also used to identify the different algal stages, as well as estimate the specific energy release, temperature range, mass loss for each stage, and heating value (i.e., total specific energy release). The estimated total specific energy release was 14.7 kJ g−1 for Chlorella sp. and 9.4 kJ g−1 for C. reinhardtii. The results indicated an endotherm in Stage 1 for both algae due to evaporation of moisture. There was also a small exotherm corresponding to the lighter volatiles. For Stage 2, the largest peak was for the Chlorella sp. carbohydrates with an estimated specific energy release of 2.3 kJ g−1, and the lipids for C. reinhardtii at 1.9 kJ g−1. The Stage 3 carbonaceous materials had the largest specific energy release, containing more than 50% of the energy among all three stages. The estimated value of the apparent activation energy was 168.6 kJ mol−1 for Chlorella sp. and 134.1 kJ mol−1 for C. reinhardtii. Information of this sort is needed for enhancing algal generation of energy-containing compounds that are required for biofuel production. © 2021

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is an abundant and renewable energy source that can be used as biofuel after physicochemical conversion, e.g. by fast pyrolysis. However, the chemical variations from wood and other biomass species affect this conversion. Chemical characterization is needed to obtain more information on the pyrolysis products depending on the biomass type and pyrolysis conditions. Here, we compared the fast pyrolysis molecular pattern of five lignocellulosic biomasses (beech, hickory, miscanthus and two brands of resinous wood pellets) obtained from a direct analysis method of solid samples coupled to ion mobility and time of flight mass spectrometry (IM-TOF MS). Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR MS) with its ultra-high resolving power was used, with a similar solid analysis introduction approach, to probe for the presence of possible unresolved isobaric compounds in the IM-TOF MS analysis. Isobaric interferences were found to be negligible and molecular formulas determined using IM-TOF MS were confirmed as reliable. Principal component analysis on the molecular formulas allowed the extraction of marker ions preferentially found in hardwood and miscanthus or softwood species. Ion mobility drift time values from these biomass markers were converted into collision-cross sections (CCS), a direct measure of structure and shape of a molecule. No significant CCS differences were observed between the markers of the five wood samples, showing isomeric similarities between the samples. In order to move forward on the structural elucidation and characterization of the pyrolysis products, IM-TOF MS and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) were performed on standard molecules and compared to the biomass pyrolysis products, highlighting the presence of isomers in the wood pyrolysis products. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The direct conversion of inedible oil to produce the second-generation of biofuel is a promising technology. In this study, Pt/SAPO-11 catalyst was synthesized, and it was further modified by Sn. Two typical inedible oils (Jatropha oil and waste lard oil) were used as feedstocks. The liquid yield, deoxygenation rate, selectivity of alkanes, and selectivity of iso-alkanes were studied. It is shown that the selectivity of alkanes and iso-alkanes increase simultaneously over Pt-Sn/SAPO-11. The selectivity of C8-C16 alkanes and iso-alkanes from Jatropha oil is 69.82 % and 39.30 %. In the case of waste lard oil, there were 64.42 % selectivity of C15-C18 alkanes and 50.05 % selectivity of C15-C18 iso-alkanes. Pt-Sn/SAPO-11 catalyst remains a higher hydrotreating activity and stability during the 72 h test. The addition of Sn not only decreases the particle size of Pt, but also leads to a strong interaction between Pt and SAPO-11. Sn modified Pt/SAPO-11 has much weak Lewis acid sites. Increase of Lewis acid sites and total acid sites enhance isomerization selectivity and deoxygenation rate simultaneously. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel is commonly produced via transesterification process, usually through the use of batch type reactor. There are significant gaps in batch reactor technologies, where the importance of operating conditions are often concluded based on the steady-state conditions. In this study, a Pareto-Hierarchical framework were employed, based on results of a 4-factor 3-level full factorial Design of Experiments. Four parameters of interest such as agitation speed, catalyst loading, methanol-to-oil ratio, and temperature, were firsts analysed using transient Pareto approach followed by hierarchical clustering. The results indicate that low methanol: oil ratio favours transesterification at the beginning, with increasing importance as the process proceeds. From it, the magnitude of standardised effect increases from 0.38 to 14.21, representing an over 37-fold improvement. Conversely, agitation speed showed a reduction of 37-fold in standardised effect throughout the transesterification process, plateauing around mid-way of the reaction. Catalyst loading and temperature shared similar trends, as they influence the activation energy. Their standardised effects peak at 180 s which is in the middle of the physical-limiting regime. Therefore, this study provides a framework to develop an analyses to make dynamic optimisation strategy better in terms of economics and yield efficiency. © 2021

AB  - As the largest consumer of rapeseed oil in the world, China should consider the environmental effect of rapeseed oil production. However, only a few improvement measures have been proposed. To fill this gap, this study analyzed the energy, carbon and water footprints of rapeseed oil production based on the International Organization for Standardization standards using the framework of life cycle assessment. Results show that most of the energy, carbon, and water footprint of rapeseed oil production can be contributed to the direct processes of rapeseed cultivation, and the indirect processes of transport and fertilizer/diesel production. The value of energy and carbon footprints are calculated as 726.07 kg oil eq and 3889.75 kg CO2 eq, respectively. For the water footprint, the values of acidification, aquatic eutrophication, carcinogens, freshwater ecotoxicity, water scarcity, and non-carcinogens are 14.24 kg SO2 eq, 4.53 kg PO4−3 eq, 6.72 × 10−5Case, 5.43 × 104 PAF.m3.d, 437.62 m3 deprived, and 1.88 × 10−5 case, respectively. Spatial analysis shows that the total environmental impacts of rapeseed production are concentrated in Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi Provinces. Correlation analysis reveals the positive correlation of human health and ecosystem quality with fertilizer application and pesticide loss. In general, the environmental effect can be effectively reduced by adjusting the industrial layout to shorten the distance of transport, improve the fine cultivation degree in low-yield areas, and decrease the use of pesticides in the hilly region of southern China. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The study investigated the effect of degumming on physicochemical properties of FAEE produced from Acacia nilotica seed oil using AOCS and ASTM standard methods. The results revealed that the values for specific gravity (0.88), iodine value (65.03 g I2/100 g) and refractive index (1.31) of A. nilotica seed oil were lower than the AOCS standard. The acid degumming showed higher removal efficiency (89%) than water degumming (77%) and was chosen for FAEE production. FAEE yield of 88.97% was obtained from acid degummed oil. The values obtained for cloud point (17.33 °C), pour point (4.67 °C), iodine value (33.35 g I2/100 g), saponification value (166.67 mg KOH/g) and acid value (1.97 mg KOH/g) of the degummed FAEE were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) lower than the values of undegummed FAEE, whereas significant (p &lt; 0.05) increase was observed in the values for flash point (132.00 °C), cetane number (65.50) and calorific value (60.13 MJ/kg). The study concluded that degummed A. nilotica seed oil could be used as feedstock for FAEE/biodiesel production. © 2021

AB  - Utilization of the enhanced Spent Residue Fluid Catalytic Cracking (SRFCC) catalysts through the acid treatment was conducted for the palm oil hydrocracking process to produce biofuels. The catalysts were characterized using Pyridine-probed Fourier Transform Infrared (Pyridine-FTIR) spectroscopy and Brunauer−Emmett−Teller-Barrett−Joyner−Halenda (BET-BJH) method. The higher number of Brønsted acid sites on the enhanced SRFCC catalysts leads to the lower conversion of palm oil as well as lower deoxygenation activity because of the slower carbocations formation process as the initiation reaction. On the other hand, the Lewis acid sites on the enhanced SRFCC catalysts have a significant role in the deoxygenation reaction mechanism. Meanwhile, the catalysts surface area and pore size are responsible for tailoring the diffusion mechanism of the mass transfer process of reactant molecules. The introduction of hydrogen gas in the reaction system has a significant role in deoxygenation, double bond cleavage, and de-coking process mechanisms. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Micro-explosive combustion is considered as an effective way to improve combustion efficiency in combustor. In this work, the micro-explosive combustion characteristics of biodiesel and DMF blended droplet are investigated using high-speed backlit image technique. The droplet is suspended at the intersection of two quartz fiber and ignited by a pair of electrodes. Flame temperature and soot concentration are measured using two-color pyrometry method. Moreover, two new parameters are proposed to analysis droplet micro-explosion, namely droplet instability and breakup index. The results shown that the instability of DMF25BD75, DMF50BD50 and DMF75BD25 droplets is mainly caused by bubbles coalescence, internal circulation of bubbles, micro-explosion and vapor jetting. The low-temperature flame region is mainly located near the droplet surface and flame edge. However, the soot concentration is highest in these two regions. The combustion of blended droplet includes a micro-explosive combustion stage and a stable combustion stage. Four modes of secondary atomization is determined according to droplet breakup index. When the DMF concentration is 50% and 75%, the burning rate is 9% and 37.5% higher than diesel, which is expected to realize rapid and high-efficient combustion. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, the cycle-to-cycle variations in natural gas/methanol bi-fueled engines under excess air/fuel ratio at 1.6 was analyzed. In order to examine the impact of the methanol substitution ratio (MSR) on cyclic variability, four values of MSRs (MSR = 0%, 3.6%, 7.5%, and 11.5%) were selected under low load conditions. The results showed that the variations in the multicycle in-cylinder pressure traces decreased with the increase in MSR. In addition, the variations in peak in-cylinder pressure (Pmax), peak of pressure rise rate (dp/dϕ)max, 50% mass fraction burned (CA50), peak of averaged gas temperature (Tmax), and indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) in 100 consecutive cycles decreased with the increase in MSR. Meanwhile, the higher was the MSR, the narrower was the range of frequency distribution of Pmax, (dp/dϕ)max, CA50, Tmax, and IMEP covered. In addition, the coefficient of variation in IMEP (COVIMEP) decreased with the increase in MSR for a specific spark timing. For instance, as MSR increased from 0% to 11.5%, the value of COVIMEP decreased from 2.25% to 1.28% when the spark timing was set to 46°CA BTDC. This is because methanol addition to natural gas leads to faster combustion with less cyclic variability. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel final product specifications must fit in a narrow property range. Density is an example of an important fuel property that strongly depends on the structure of the components and may largely vary among the vegetable oils and animal fats. Therefore, it is interesting to have a model capable to predict the biofuel density as a function of its raw materials. Meanwhile, it is also interesting to model the behavior of a fuel under working conditions and it is done using thermodynamic models. However, the deficiency of these models in the calculation of volumetric properties is well known. So, the objective of this work is the development of new volume translation functions for predicting the density of biodiesel from different raw material sources using the Peng-Robinson equation of state, with critical properties calculated with the Constantinou-Gani group contribution method. Volume translation is made as a function of temperature and average molar mass. The functions were statistically evaluated for the quality of their parameters, the adequacy of the fit, and the prediction confidence interval. Then, the best functions were selected, and their robustness was proved with good results obtained in the prediction of several literature data at different conditions. With this approach, we provide an extensible model, applicable to all kinds of biodiesel and more likely to be extrapolated to more severe temperature and pressure conditions. Hence, density calculations can be done with a simple and readily available model at any stage of production and application. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, the feasibility of banana straw (BS) hydrolysate as carbon source and reutilizing the pretreated liquor (PL) of BS in the Rhodosporidium toruloides fermentation was explored for the first time. When BS hydrolysate was used as the carbon source, total biomass concentration, lipid concentration, and lipid content under optimal conditions reached 15.52 g/L, 5.83 g/L, and 37.56% (w/w), respectively, which was similar to the results of pure sugar control. After detoxification, 50% PL can be returned to enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation, and total biomass concentration, lipid concentration, and lipid content can reach 15.14 g/L, 5.59 g/L, and 36.91% (w/w). Then, ethanol stillage (ES) was used as the nitrogen source. The NaCl and glycerol of ES could promote lipid accumulation, reaching 7.52 g/L under optimized conditions. Finally, microbial lipid production from BS hydrolysate and ES without any additional nutrients was investigated, and the maximum total biomass concentration, lipid concentration, and lipid content were 13.55 g/L, 4.88 g/L, and 36.01% (w/w), respectively. Besides, the main compositions of microbial lipid produced were C16 and C18, and the biodiesel production from the microbial lipid could meet Chinese and US standard through theoretical numerical calculation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - One of the highest costs in bio-butanol production is the separation of butanol from the fermentation broth, which is composed of acetone, butanol, and ethanol. Instead of using butanol, researchers experimentally investigated the utilization of the acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) mixture in gasoline and diesel engines to promising results. However, there has been no well-to-wheel (WTW) study to determine the life cycle energy balance and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that covers the entire production process and use of ABE as a transportation fuel. In this study, the WTW analysis of ABE from two feedstocks (corn and corn stover-based) and their benefits in replacing a portion of gasoline or diesel with ABE is investigated. Results show that ABE could achieve 56–80% fossil fuel savings and 53–83% GHG emission reductions when compared to both gasoline and diesel. The WTW analysis indicated that ABE from both feedstocks has the potential to become as an alternative biofuel directly and as an additive blend for diesel or gasoline. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper describes the possibility of replacing the single-fuel spark-ignition engines (SFSIE) fuelled with gasoline by the dual-fuel spark-ignition engines (DFSIE) fuelled with bioethanol and biogas. GASEQ software was used to estimate the combustion exhaust gases of the bioethanol, biogas and gasoline with 27% ethanol and 20% ethanol in order to calculate the energy-ecological efficiency of the DFSIE and the SFSIE. The tank-to-wheel (TTW) emissions were calculated to analyse the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted per kilometre and compared to the tailpipe emissions standards defined by the United States and European Union. The results showed that the energy-ecological efficiency found for the DFSIE fuelled with 50% bioethanol and 50% biogas was higher than that found for the SFSIE fuelled with gasoline. However, the TTW emissions of the DFSIE in category 2.0 presented the lowest emission values when compared to the other categories. As can be seen from the results obtained in the present study, the use of the DFSIE fuelled with bioethanol and biogas reveals the effect on the energy-ecological efficiency and the TTW emissions. The findings of this study can be used as a guide for public policy makers in order to assist their planning of sustainable urban mobility programs. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The need to substitute fossil fuels with energy alternatives has favored the development of biodiesel and green diesel, which generate less amount of particulate matter (PM), but their biological reactivity is unknown, an important factor of quality and risk. Therefore, the genotoxicity and mutagenicity potential of PM emitted by the combustion of mixtures of green diesel and palm biodiesel with petroleum diesel has been evaluated; 10% palm biodiesel (B10), 10% and 30% green diesel (HVO10 and HVO30) and ultralow sulfur diesel (ULSD) were subjected to combustion at two engine operating speeds: 1890 and 2410 rpm. From each PM sample, the organic fraction was extracted to evaluate the mutagenicity with the Ames test in the presence and absence of microsomal enzymes, and the genotoxicity with the alkaline comet assay, while in the Ames test, concentrations of equivalent 3, 1.5, and 0.8 μg of PM/μl were considered; in the comet assay, equivalent 3.1, 6.3, and 12.5 μg of PM/μl were tested. The organic fraction of the PM from the ULSD was the least genotoxic and mutagenic. In contrast, the organic fraction of the PM of HVO30 showed the highest genotoxic and mutagenic activity (p < 0.05). Although the genotoxic potential of PM generated at 1890 rpm, low speed, was slightly higher, no relationship was found regarding the engine operating speed. The results of this investigation show that the fuel extraction method and the mixture with the petroleum diesel affect the quality of the PM and, therefore, its biological activity. Consequently, the physicochemical monitoring of the PM should be complemented with biological procedures to evaluate the quality of alternative fuels and protect the environmental health. © 2020 by ASME.

AB  - The present work concerns the conversion of coconut oil into hydrocarbons within the chain length range of jet biofuel through the pathway called hydroprocessing of esters and fatty acids (HEFA). The aim is to employ the resulting mixture as an alternative biofuel in the aviation sector. The process involved two steps: (i) hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) over a sulfided NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst, followed by (ii) hydroisomerization (HIS) over a Pt/SAPO-11 catalyst. Preliminary tests were carried out with model compounds: lauric acid and n-dodecane for HDO and HIS, respectively. In both steps, middle processing temperatures (~ 340–350 °C) were low enough to prevent excessive cracking but high enough to provide acceptable reaction rates and to prevent coke formation. The HDO step rendered a mixture constituted basically by n-alkanes. The subsequent HIS permitted to increase the content of branched chains. The final HEFA-SPK (where SPK is the abbreviation for synthetic paraffinic kerosene) had an acidic index zero and a relatively high content of monomethylalkanes. Furthermore, due to the fatty chain composition of the starting oil, the chain length distribution of the resulting biofuel matched well with that of conventional jet fuels, so that subsequent steps of cracking and fractionation, which increase costs and reduce the process yield, were not required. The obtained results are encouraging in terms of using coconut oil-based HEFA-SPK in the formulation of sustainable alternative jet fuels at competitive costs and with relevant environmental and social benefits. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Since 2001, four emission measurement campaigns have been conducted in multiple traffic tunnels in the megacity of São Paulo, Brazil, an area with a fleet of more than 7 million vehicles running on fuels with high biofuel contents: gasoline + ethanol for light-duty vehicles (LDVs) and diesel + biodiesel for heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs). Emission factors for LDVs and HDVs were calculated using a carbon balance method, the pollutants considered including nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and sulfur dioxide, as well as carbon dioxide and ethanol. From 2001 to 2018, fleet-average emission factors for LDVs and HDVs, respectively, were found to decrease by 4.9 and 5.1% per year for CO and by 5.5 and 4.2% per year for NOx. These reductions demonstrate that regulations for vehicle emissions adopted in Brazil in the last 30 years improved air quality in the megacity of São Paulo significantly, albeit with a clear delay. These findings, especially those for CO, indicate that official emission inventories underestimate vehicle emissions. Here, we demonstrated that the adoption of emission factors calculated under real-world conditions can dramatically improve air quality modeling in the region. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) biocrude is a promising source of energy with potential for co-processing with conventional fuels or as a drop-in fuel. However, it needs upgrading to reduce heteroatoms (e.g., N, S, O), improve physical properties, stability, and miscibility with hydrocarbons. Distillation is a conventional physical upgrading method that has not been studied extensively for biocrude using an industry-accepted procedure on a large scale. In this study, an algae-based biocrude was distilled into four fractions using ASTM D2892 standard method: Fraction 1 (<100°C), Fraction 2 (100-175 °C), Fraction 3 (175-275 °C), and Fraction 4 (275-350 °C). The column has 15 theoretical stages, so it is realistic for large scale production. Algae-based biocrude is rich in nitrogen and sulphur content, which causes NOx and SOx emissions contribute to acid rain and soot formation, poisons the upgrading catalysts. Distillation decreased the nitrogen content of all fractions by 18.1 – 91.0%, and a similar reduction in sulphur (up to 71.2%) and oxygen content (up to 15.2%) was also observed in the heavy fractions. Fractional distillation reduced the viscosity and density of biocrude fractions making the fractionated fuel more similar to diesel, which increases the potential for applications either in co-processing or as a drop-in fuel for diesel engines. Stability tests for ten weeks’ storage in three different conditions (4 ℃, 15-33 ℃ and 43 ℃) revealed distillate fractions were far more stable in terms of chemical structure, viscosity, and higher heating value. Miscibility and blending stability tests showed that the miscibility of the distillates mixture (DistMix) was greatly improved due to the reduction in heteroatoms. In addition, the blend was stable after one-month in storage, which all assists potential for co-processing. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The objective of this work was to assess the environmental performances of advanced biofuels produced from perennial energy crops (miscanthus and willow) grown in bioenergy buffer strips (BBS) and compare them with the environmental performances of alternative systems providing the same function, i.e. private mobility. The growing evidence of potentially negative environmental impacts of bioenergy pathways calls for renewed efforts in identifying win-win bioenergy pathways, thus capable of mitigating climate change without worsening other environmental impacts. An holistic approach encompassing all the relevant areas of environmental concern is thus fundamental to highlight environmental trade-offs. Therefore, in this study we follow an attributional Life Cycle Assessment approach, but our analysis includes detailed modelling of biogenic carbon pools, nutrients cycles, infrastructures’ impacts as well as the expansion of the system boundaries to include the fuel use. We find that the fragmented and linear configuration of the buffer strips does not affect significantly the GHG emissions of lignocellulosic ethanol for BBS compared to growing the crops in open field. Additionally, we find that ethanol from perennials grown in BBS has the potential to reduce several other environmental impacts associated to private mobility. Firstly, the cultivation of miscanthus and willow in BBS enables both the removal of nutrients from the environment and the removal of carbon from the atmosphere, through the creation of an additional terrestrial sink. Secondly, when compared to the use of fossil gasoline, bioethanol from BBS crops generates lower impacts on all other areas of environmental concern, such as resources depletion or air pollution. We also find that cars fuelled with bioethanol form buffer strips perform even better than electric vehicles in all the impact categories analysed except for acidification and particulate matter emissions, where battery electric vehicles running on renewables perform slightly better. We conclude that bioethanol from perennial crops grown in BBS is a good example of nature-based solution, able to reduce GHG emissions without shifting the environmental burden on other areas of environmental concern. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this experimental study, a novel combustion technique, "reactivity-controlled compression ignition"(RCCI), has been investigated using alcohols acting as low-reactivity fuel (LRF) and mineral diesel acting as high-reactivity fuel (HRF). Combustion experiments were performed in a single-cylinder research engine at a constant engine speed of 1500 rpm and a low engine load of 3 bar brake mean effective pressure (BMEP). RCCI combustion is a practical low-temperature combustion (LTC) concept, which was achieved using three primary alcohols: Methanol, Ethanol, and Butanol in different premixed ratios (rp = 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75) with mineral diesel. Results showed a relatively superior performance and emissions characteristics of RCCI combustion than the conventional compression ignition (CI) combustion. The influence of LRF was visible in the RCCI combustion, which exhibited a more stable combustion than the baseline CI combustion. Retarded start of combustion (SoC) with increasing rp was exhibited by all alcohols; however, this trend was more dominant for Methanol/diesel- and Ethanol/diesel-fueled RCCI combustion. The presence of moisture traces in Ethanol was clearly observed in Ethanol/diesel-fueled RCCI combustion. Butanol/diesel-fueled RCCI combustion showed more significant similarity with conventional CI combustion at the lower rp. RCCI combustion-fueled with different alcohols produced relatively lower emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx); however, hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions were higher than that of baseline CI combustion. Among different alcohols, Methanol/diesel and Ethanol/diesel showed a higher reduction in particulate matter (PM) emissions than the Butanol/diesel-fueled RCCI combustion. At higher rp, particulate characteristics of RCCI combustion were similar to that of spark ignition (SI) engines. Correlation between the total particulate mass (TPM) and the NOx emissions showed a strong possibility of significant emission reduction by employing RCCI combustion in the engines while ensuring energy diversification and use of biofuels in an efficient manner. © 2021 SAE International.

AB  - Strategies to remove carbon from the atmosphere are needed to meet global climate goals. Promising strategies include the conversion of waste biomass to hydrogen, methane, liquid fuels, or electricity coupled with CO2 capture and storage (CCS). A key challenge for these projects is the need to connect geographically dispersed biomass supplies with geologic storage sites by either transporting biomass or CO2. We assess the cost of transport for biomass conversion projects with CCS using publicly available cost data for trucking, rail, and CO2 pipelines in the United States. We find that for large projects (order of 1 Mt/yr CO2 or greater), CO2 by pipeline is the lowest cost option. However, for projects that send most of the biomass carbon to storage, such as gasification to hydrogen or electricity production, biomass by rail is a competitive option. For smaller projects and lower fractions of carbon sent to storage, such as for pyrolysis to liquid fuels, CO2 by rail is the lowest cost option. Assessing three plausible example projects in the United States, we estimate that total transport costs range from $24/t-CO2 stored for a gasification to hydrogen project traversing 670 km to $36/t for a gasification to renewable natural gas project traversing 530 km. In general, if developers have flexibility in choosing transport mode and project type, biomass sources and storage sites can be connected across hundreds of kilometers for transport costs in the range of $20-40/t-CO2 stored. Truck and rail are often viable modes when pipelines cannot be constructed. Distances of 1,000 km or more can be connected in the same cost range when shared CO2 pipelines are employed. © Copyright © 2021 Stolaroff, Pang, Li, Kirkendall, Goldstein, Aines and Baker.

AB  - Many concerns, such as economic and technical viability and social and ethical aspects, must be considered for a feedstock selection for advanced biofuels. Industrialized countries promote the use of industrial waste or by-products for this purpose. In particular, turpentine has several properties which make it an attractive source for biofuels, including its possible industrial waste origin. Nevertheless, turpentine has shown some disadvantages when blended directly with diesel, especially because it increases the sooting tendency. On the contrary, some derivatives of turpentine can be suitable for diesel blends. Thus, the evaluation of their properties is necessary. In the present work, the properties of hydrogenated and oxyfunctionalized turpentine have been analysed and compared with the purpose of elucidating their benefits and drawbacks in diesel fuel applications, using European standards as a reference. The results show a promising application of both hydroturpentine and oxyturpentine as diesel components. While hydroturpentine significantly improves the diesel cold flow properties, oxyturpentine noticeably reduces the sooting tendency. This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - In this paper, a multiperiod, multiobjective, and multiproduct second-generation biodiesel supply chain network is innovated, taking into account sustainable development and international resources and demand. The proposed model maximizes the total profit and positive social issues and minimizes the harmful environmental consequences of the network. Furthermore, as trade is nowadays considered to be an important issue on an international scale, economic globalization is also considered in the present study by expanding the operational activities of supplying feedstocks and selling final products worldwide. The model is validated through real data collected within Iran and some Asian countries and solved by the interactive fuzzy programming method. The experimental results verify the efficiency of the model for countries that have the capacity to produce inedible-based biofuel. As a result, the highest share of the revenues is earmarked for international biodiesel sales (80%), which indicates that globalization can increase the profit to a great extent. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - In early 2020, Indonesia implemented the biodiesel 30 (B30) program as an initiative to reduce Indonesia’s dependency on fossil fuels and to protect Indonesia’s palm oil market. However, palm oil has received international criticism due to its association with harmful environmental externalities. This paper analysed whether an investment in palm oil-based biofuel (POBB) provides Indonesia with the ability to achieve its environmental and financial goals. In this research, we performed a meta-analysis on biofuel energy return on investment (EROI) by examining 44 biofuel projects using ten types of biofuel feedstocks from 13 countries between 1995 and 2016. Results showed an average EROI of 3.92 and 3.22 for POBB and other biomass-based biofuels (OBBB), respectively. This shows that if only energy inputs and outputs are considered, biofuels provide a positive energy return. However, biofuels, including those from palm oil, produce externalities especially during land preparation and land restoration. We also compared these EROI biofuel results with other renewable energy sources and further analysed the implications for renewable energies to meet society’s energy demands in the future. Results showed that biofuel gives the lowest EROI compared to other renewable energy sources. Its EROI of 3.92, while positive, has been categorised as “not feasible for development”. If Indonesia plans to continue with its biofuel program, some major improvements will be necessary. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - A field experiment with reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) was carried out at LAMMC Vėžaičiai Branch (Western Lithuania) in 2010–2016 with the aim to evaluate the impact of liming and nitrogen on grass productivity, biomass chemical content and energetic parameters of the pellets. The site soil is the natural acidic loam Retisol (pH 4.2–4.6). Reed canary grass productivity was significantly affected by the year of growing and nitrogen fertilization. The average annual dry matter (DM) yield varied from 5442 to 11,114 t ha−1 . The highest yields were obtained using the annual rate of 120 kg ha−1 N (nitrogen) fertilizers. Soil liming had a negligible effect on biomass productivity. Nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUE) varied greatly depending on the growing year and N fertilization rate. After analyzing the properties of reed canary grass and wood sawdust granules, it was found that the granules obtained a high density exceeding 1000 kg m−3 DM. The lowest calorific value of reed canary grass pellets was found to be quite high—17.4 MJ kg−1 DM. All harmful emissions did not exceed the permissible values. Summarizing the results, it can be stated that reed canary grass pellets may be recommended for burning in domestic boilers. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The paper is presenting the experimental analysis of the use of biodiesel from waste sunflower oil and a blend of sunflower oil with palm oil as fuel for aviation turbo-engines. A comparative analysis for fuel mixtures made of Jet A + 5% Aeroshell 500 Oil (Ke) with 10%, 30%, and 50% for each bio-fuel type has been performed and Ke has been used as reference. Firstly, the following physical and chemical properties were determined: density, viscosity, flash point, freezing point, calorific power. Then, elemental analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis were conducted for Ke, biodiesel obtained from recycled sunflower oil (SF), biodiesel obtained from blending recycled sunflower oil, and recycled palm oil (SFP), and for each fuel blend. Secondly, experimental tests of the blends have been conducted on the Jet Cat P80® micro-turbo engine (Gunt Hamburg, Barsbüttel, Germany). The tests have been conducted at different engine working regimes as follows: idle, cruise, intermediate, and maximum. For each regime, a one-minute testing period was chosen, and the engine parameters have been monitored. The turbo engine instrumentation recorded the temperature after the compressor and before the turbine, the fuel consumption and air flow, pressure inside the combustion chamber, and generated thrust. The burning efficiency and the specific consumption have been calculated for all four above-mentioned regimes and for all fuel blends. Two accelerometers have been installed on the engine’s support to register radial and axial vibrations allowing the assessment of engine stability. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Recently, algae seem to be a promising feedstock for the future alternative fuel (green fuel) instead of fossil fuel. Algae (macro- and micro-algae) may represent as a main resource for biofuel and biodiesel due to their high biosynthesis effeminacy to produce lipids and fatty acids comparing to other types of biomass. Algae can be an interesting source of commercial and eco-friendly fuel due to algae local availability and low CO2 emission, respectively. The current study was conducted to compare the percentage of oil production in three different genera of algae, including Cosmarium, Spirogyra and Chara, and examine the ability of using the algae oil as an alternative fuel for industrial purposes. Soxhlet-based method and n- hexane organic solvent were used for extraction of algae oils followed by biochemical analysis and gas chromatography (GC-Mass) technique for algae oil detection. The algae Cosmarium had 2.8 % algal oil yield, and recorded the highest yield of the total fatty acids (65.60 %), whereas Spirogyra recorded a low result by producing 32.07 %, noting that Chara alga showed the lowest value (21.58). The chemical analysis of algal oils showed that the quality of algae oil fatty acids proved to be the best choice. Cosmarium oil recorded the highest ratio (2.05 %) for unsaturated fatty acids (USAFA)/ saturated fatty acids (SAFA) and the degree of unsaturation (DU) was 84.86. While, Spirogyra and Chara showed that the value of USAFA/SAFA was 1.58 and 0.56 % with DU of 27.74 and 9.68, respectively. In this context, Cosmarium alga proved to be the best feedstock for biomass of algal oil production with astounding properties of algal biodiesel. © 2021, Egyptian Society for the Development of Fisheries and Human Health.

AB  - Biofuels are fuels of biological origin, and they are among the prominent energy sources from renewable energy sources in recent years. Unlike fuels such as petroleum derivatives, coal, natural gas, biofuels are renewable and sustainable energy sources. Biofuels can be obtained by thermochemical or biochemical methods from agricultural and forestry products, animal and vegetable residues and wastes, organic origin domestic, industrial and urban wastes. Global warming caused by greenhouse gas effect is today shown as the most important common environmental problem in the world. The most important advantage of using biofuels in environmental terms is that there will be a reduction of greenhouse gas impact and acid rain. In this study, it is aimed to produce and characterize jet fuel by converting from pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo) seed oil, which is a sustainable bio energy source, into biofuel, by transesterification method. It has an important place in matters such as environment, sustainability, and reduction of carbon emissions. Biojet fuel produced using pumpkin seed oil, which is a sustainable resource, is a candidate product for development and commercialization. © 2021. Sinem Gürkan Aydin Arzu Özgen; published by UIKTEN.

AB  - Fast-growing poplar trees from plantations are the source of inexpensive wood that is intended mainly for chemical processing in the pulp and paper industry. Their potential as raw material for biofuel manufacturing is widely discussed as well. The detailed chemical composition of this raw material is therefore an important question. Five species of poplars were investigated: Populus alba, P. maximowiczii, P. trichocarpa, P. nigra, and P. tremula. Wood is a material consisting mainly of lignocellulose, but there are also many extractives. In temperate zone climate they typ-ically represent up to 5% of wood mass. Their identification is difficult, due to various classes of compounds and great number of individual ones. These compounds can affect the properties of wood—its resistance to biotic agents and suitability to enzymatic treatment towards biofuels. Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometer (GC-MS) was used to analysis of extractives in various species of poplar wood. Compounds from several classes were identified like phenols, fatty acids, and their derivatives, sterols. Their identification was discussed along with estimation of their content in wood of investigated species. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - To reduce the usage of gasoline extracted from fossil fuel resources, there is a need for a sustainable alternative fuel that has the potential to replace gasoline. In this work, the oil extracted from the leaves of Basil oil (BO), which gives a low cetane number, was investigated in the port fuel injection installed spark-ignition engine to study its feasibility as a replacement for gasoline fuel. Initially, the basil oil was taken to GC MS and FTIR analysis to study the chemical compounds and types of chemical bonds present in it. Then three BO blends were prepared by blending BO in the ratio of 10:90, 20:80, and 30:70 with gasoline. The blends were undergone a phase separation test and the fuel properties of sole BO and its blends were measured. The blended BO fuels were tested experimentally to find out their impact on the performance, emission, and combustion characteristics of the engine. The results show that the performance of the BO blends is lesser than that of gasoline. At maximum engine brake power, the BTE of BO10 (Basil oil 10% + Gasoline 90%) is 25.08% which is 1.74% lesser than the BTE given by gasoline. The NOx emission of BO10 is 318 ppm which is about 6.4% lesser than gasoline. The levels of CO and HC emissions are increased with an increase in the blending ratio of BO in the gasoline. Though the BO blend performance is not equivalent to that of gasoline, a suitable engine modification can improve its performance. ©2021 Seventh Sense Research Group.

AB  - The article presents the results of research on the influence of two fuel additives that selectively affect the combustion process in a diesel engine cylinder. The addition of NitrON® reduces the concentration of nitrogen oxides (NOx), due to a reduction in the kinetic combustion rate, at the cost of a slight increase in the concentration of particulate matter (PM) in the engine exhaust gas. The Reduxco® additive reduces PM emissions by increasing the diffusion combustion rate, while slightly increasing the NOx concentration in the engine exhaust gas. Research conducted by the authors confirmed that the simultaneous use of both of these additives in the fuel not only reduced both NOx and PM emissions in the exhaust gas but additionally the reduction of NOx and PM emissions was greater than the sum of the effects of these additives—the synergy effect. Findings indicated that the waveforms of the heat release rate (dQ/dα) responsible for the emission of NOx and PM in the exhaust gas differed for the four tested fuels in relation to the maximum value (selectively and independently in the kinetic and diffusion stage), and they were also phase shifted. Due to this, the heat release process Q(α) was characterized by a lower amount of heat released in the kinetic phase compared to fuel with NitrON® only and a greater amount of heat released in the diffusion phase compared to fuel with Reduxco® alone, which explained the lowest NOx and PM emissions in the exhaust gas at that time. For example for the NOx concentration in the engine exhaust: the Nitrocet® fuel additive (in the used amount of 1500 ppm) reduces the NOx concentration in the exhaust gas by 18% compared to the base fuel. The addition of a Reduxco® catalyst to the fuel (1500 ppm) unfortunately increases the NOx concentration by up to 20%. On the other hand, the combustion of the complete tested fuel, containing both additives simultaneously, is characterized, thanks to the synergy effect, by the lowest NOx concentration (reduction by 22% in relation to the base). For example for PM emissions: the Nitrocet® fuel additive does not significantly affect the PM emissions in the engine exhaust (up to a few per cent compared to the base fuel). The addition of a Reduxco® catalyst to the fuel greatly reduces PM emissions in the engine exhaust, up to 35% compared to the base fuel. On the other hand, the combustion of the complete tested fuel containing both additives simultaneously is characterized by the synergy effect with the lowest PM emission (reduction of 39% compared to the base fuel). © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Climate change as a worldwide phenomenon is the cause of multinational agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Biogas is one of the most promising biofuels for the integration of clean energy sources; however, biogas has the disadvantage of a low calorific value. To overcome this problem, mechanical devices such as swirlers are implemented in combustion chambers (CCs) to increase their combustion efficiencies. A swirler induces rotation in the airstream that keeps a constant re-ignition of the air–fuel mixture in the combustion. We present the numerical modeling using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and experimental testing of combustion with biogas in a CC, including an optimized swirler in the airstream with a swirl number (Sn) of 2.48. A turbulence model of the renormalization group (RNG) was used to analyze the turbulence. Chemistry was parameterized using the laminar flamelet model. The numerical model allows visualizing the recirculation zone generated at the primary zone, and partially at the intermediate zone of the CC caused by the strong swirl. Temperature distribution profiles show the highest temperatures located at the intermediate and dilution zones, with the last one being a characteristic feature of biogas combustion. A strong swirl in the airstream generates low-velocity zones at the center of the CC. This effect centers flame, avoiding hot spots near the flame tube and flashback at the structural components. Regarding pollutant emissions, the goal of a biogas that generates less pollutants than nonrenewable gases is accomplished. It is observed that the mole fraction of NO in the CC is close to zero, while the mole fraction of CO2 after combustion is lowered compared to the original mole fraction contained in the biogas (0.25). The mole fraction of CO2 obtained in experimental tests was 0.0127. Results obtained in the numerical model for temperatures and mole fractions of CO2 and NO show a behavior similar to that of the experimental model. Experimental results for mole fraction of CO emissions are also presented and have a mean value of 0.0009. This value lies within allowed pollutant emissions for CO according to national environmental regulations. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Currently, most automotive industries use fossil fuels, like diesel fuel, which are harmful for the environment and are known as the main reason for global warming. To reduce the adverse effects of these fuels, scholars have investigated and suggested green fuels like biodiesel. However, further studies should be conducted to improve the functionality of biodiesel fuel in diesel engines. In the current study, three completely distinct biodiesel fuels (namely, B1 with 96 % lauric oil, B2 with 88 % oleic oil, and B3 with 89.5 % ricinoleic oil) were numerically evaluated to carefully investigate the effects of the number of carbon atoms, the O–H bond, and viscosity on the performance of a CI engine. First, the predicted in-cylinder pressure, the rate of heat released, and NO emissions were compared to experimental results and an appropriate accord was obtained. For the mentioned biodiesels, the parameters of engine speed, injection angle, piston bowl center depth, and compression ratio were investigated by CFD code under different engine speeds. It was found that changing the piston bowl center depth (PBCD) value from 0.0042 to 0.009 m increased NO and the indicated power by 4% and 3%, respectively, for B1, B2, and B3 biofuels. In addition, when the engine was fueled by Corylus avellana biodiesel, the change in compression ratio from 16 to 24 increased peak pressure and torque by around 77 % and 17 %, respectively. The results showed that the cylinder fueled by high viscosity biodiesel has lower air-fuel mixing. A fuel that has more oxygen atoms in its chemical structure can produce higher NO emissions. Moreover, the injection angle of 150° led to increased fuel consumption rate and indicated power compared to the injection angle of 160°. It was determined that the compression ratio has significant effects on emission and combustion characteristics. © 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - A large amount of spent bleaching earth (SBE) solid waste is generated by the vegetable oil refining industry. This spent bleaching earth contains entrapped crude oil and in most cases, it is disposed of in its pristine state, which is considered an environmental hazard. In this work, the regeneration of SBE by pyrolysis or solvent extraction, and the conversion of the recovered entrapped vegetable oil to biodiesel are investigated. The entrapped oil was extracted using n-hexane, methanol or steam as solvents, and the SBE was regenerated by pyrolysis under inert environment of Nitrogen at 450 °C, 550 °C and 650 °C. After oil extraction, the regenerated bleaching earth (RBE) was activated and employed in virgin vegetable oil bleaching. Peroxide activated samples of methanol-extracted and pyrolyzed regenerated bleaching earth at 450 °C and 650 °C exhibit superior bleaching property; demonstrating that the SBE could be regenerated to have superior bleaching capacity over fresh bleaching earth. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis of the SBE show that methanol extracted 23.5% out of the 35% residual oil (i.e. 67% efficiency) compared to 15.7% (i.e. 45% efficiency) by n-hexane, while pyrolysis extracted 33% out of the 35% residual oil (i.e. 95% efficiency). GC–MS analysis of the produced biodiesel shows that the n-hexane extracted oil produces more fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). Therefore, the choice of solvent depends on the intended application; as methanol regenerates the SBE better while retaining its adsorptive properties, while n-hexane gives a better biodiesel yield. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Flue Gas Condensers (FGC) are used to increase the thermal output of biomass boilers. This reduces the emissions per unit of produced energy but furthermore, fine dust particles will be collected in the condenser. These condensers therefore have a double effect on the specific particulate matter emissions. In addition to the mechanisms that cause particle capture such as thermophoresis and diffusiophoresis, other agglomeration or condensation growth mechanisms also influence the size of the emitted particles. Due to the combination of these mechanisms, the capture efficiency depends on particle size. A size range presenting a lower capture efficiency, called a penetration window, is generally observed. Measurements on a 5 MWth boiler showed that this penetration window is in size range 0.07–0.49 μm where the capture efficiency is reduced by around 20%. Measurements on an 18 kWth boiler showed that the penetration window is in the size range 0.04–0.49 μm and the capture efficiency can even be negative in this window. For the medium-scale boiler, the condenser reduces the overall particulate emissions by 64% in number and 62% in mass per m3, and 70% in number and 69% in mass per MJ. For the small-scale boiler, the condenser reduces the overall particulate emissions by 4% in number and 50% in mass per m3, and 14% in number and 55% in mass per MJ. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Winter oilseed rape (WOSR) is the major oil crop cultivated in Europe and the most important feedstock for biodiesel. Up to 90% of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from biodiesel production can occur during oilseed rape cultivation. Therefore, mitigation strategies are required and need to focus on direct nitrous oxide (N2O) emission as one of the largest GHG contributors in biodiesel production. Earlier studies show that nitrification inhibitors (NIs) can reduce N2O emissions derived from N-fertilization. Since information on the effect of biogas digestates with or without NIs on N2O emissions from WOSR fields is scarce, the aim of this study was to evaluate their effects on N2O emissions, mineral N dynamics, and oil yield in WOSR production fertilized with digestate. The study was conducted at five sites across Germany over three years resulting in 15 full site-years data sets. Across all sites and years, N2O emission from WOSR fertilized with biogas digestate (180 kg NH4+-N ha−1yr−1) ranged between 0.2 and 3.5 kg N2O–N ha−1 yr−1. Due to the reduction of the nitrate concentrations following digestate application, application of NI significantly reduced annual N2O emission by 36%. Our results demonstrate that NI can be an effective measure for reducing N2O emissions from digestate application, but its effectiveness depends on soil and weather conditions, and ultimately on the site-specific potential for N2O production and release. There was no effect of NI application on grain and oil yield. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Climate change and energy security promote using renewable sources of energy such as biofuels. High woody biomass production achieved from short-rotation intensive plantations is a strategy that is increasing in many parts of the world. However, broad expansion of bioenergy feedstock production may have significant environmental consequences. This study investigates the watershed-scale hydrological impacts of Eucalyptus (E. grandis) plantations for energy production in a humid subtropical watershed in Entre Rios province, Argentina. A Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was calibrated and validated for streamflow, leaf area index (LAI), and biomass production cycles. The model was used to simulate various Eucalyptus plantation scenarios that followed physically based rules for land use conversion (in various extents and locations in the watershed) to study hydrological effects, biomass production, and the green water footprint of energy production. SWAT simulations indicated that the most limiting factor for plant growth was shallow soils causing seasonal water stress. This resulted in a wide range of biomass productivity throughout the watershed. An optimization algorithm was developed to find the best location for Eucalyptus development regarding highest productivity with least water impact. E. grandis plantations had higher evapotranspiration rates compared to existing terrestrial land cover classes; therefore, intensive land use conversion to E. grandis caused a decline in streamflow, with January through March being the most affected months. October was the least-affected month hydrologically, since high rainfall rates overcame the canopy interception and higher ET rates of E. grandis in this month. Results indicate that, on average, producing 1 kg of biomass in this region uses 0.8 m3 of water, and the green water footprint of producing 1 m3 fuel is approximately 2150 m3 water, or 57 m3 water per GJ of energy, which is lower than reported values for wood-based ethanol, sugar cane ethanol, and soybean biodiesel. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Hydrocarbon pollution is an increasing problem affecting soil ecosystems. However, some microorganisms can cope with these pollutants and even facilitate plant establishment and thus phytoremediation. Within soil, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) have developed several strategies to survive and flourish under adverse conditions. Among these is the hyphal healing mechanism (HHM), a process allowing hyphae to re-establish integrity after physical injury. This mechanism differs among species and genera of AMF. However, whether and to what extent hydrocarbon pollution impacts the HHM is unknown. Here, the HHM was monitored in vitro on two AMF strains, Rhizophagus irregularis MUCL 41833 and Gigaspora sp. MUCL 52331, under increasing concentrations of diesel (1, 2, and 5% v:v). The addition of diesel slowed-down the HHM in both fungi. On Gigaspora sp., this effect was limited and most hyphae were able to heal after injury. Conversely, all steps of healing were severely impaired in R. irregularis. That fungus reconnected the injured hyphae at a much lower frequency than the Gigaspora sp., instead investing its energy to link neighboring hyphae or roots, or developing new branches from uninjured hyphae. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The transport sector increasing energy demand has encouraged the search for alternative technologies for biofuels production with lower manufacturing costs and higher process efficiency and environmental performance. Lignocellulosic biofuels are equivalents to petroleum products and can be adapted to meet the properties requirements of current engines. However, their major disadvantages are the high production costs and the lack of infrastructure. In this work, the focus is on the implementation of a multi-objective optimization methodology for synthesis of novel intensified biomass-to-liquid (BtL) technologies with lower environmental impact and costs, as well as higher process safety and efficiency. A novel optimization methodology is applied to two process configurations that were synthesized in a previous work [1], in which the evaluation of a BtL processing superstructure under different economic constraints and product profiles scenarios was performed. From the configurations, the two case studies with higher production of both gasoline and diesel were selected for this work. For the synthesis of intensified BtL technologies, the optimal separation units’ design parameters that meet the combination of economic, safety and environmental indexes, and two green chemistry metrics were selected. By applying the methodology, the optimal intensified process presents a higher return on investment of 22 (%/y) compared to 18 (%/y) for the base case flowsheet. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The advent of policies that incentivize or require alternative diesel fuels has increased the demand for the development of fast analytical methods aiming for the quality control of these fuels. This study approached an alternative method for the determination of biodiesel acidity employing capillary zone electrophoresis based on free fatty acids screening and quantification. Sample preparation comprised vortex-assisted liquid-liquid extraction of free fatty acids and was a crucial step for analysis. It was studied through a 32 full factorial design considering sample mass and the stirring time. Then, solvent suitability was evaluated univariately. The free fatty acid screening was carried out employing a capillary zone electrophoresis method able to separate C16:0, C18:0, C18:1 n-9, C18:2 n-6, and C18:3 n-3, major fatty acids in a variety of vegetable oils used for biodiesel synthesis. In addition to the straightforward sample preparation protocol, the running time of the developed method was only 12 min. Moreover, ultraviolet absorption indirect detection of analytes was approached to avoid analytes derivatization, considering the lack of chromophore groups in saturated fatty acids. Statistical tests did not evidence any significant differences in the biodiesel acidity determination expressed in percentage of free fatty acids when comparing the proposed capillary zone electrophoresis method and the traditional potentiometric titration approach within the 95% confidence interval, which demonstrates the suitability of this alternative method for the biodiesel quality control in routine. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - BACKGROUND: Biobutanol is considered to be a promising alternative biofuel in terms of sustainability and environmental friendliness because of its desirable properties. High purity isopropanol–butanol–ethanol (IBE) mixture can be directly used as gasoline additive. However, the purification process of IBE is hindered because of its low concentration and high energy consumption. In order to reduce energy consumption and improve the efficiency of the IBE purification process, two novel processes combining liquid–liquid extraction with extractive distillation or azeotropic distillation are proposed. Moreover, the heat integration designs of the processes are carried out to further reduce energy. These processes are compared with regard to energy, economic, environmental and exergy impact. RESULTS: The results show that the energy consumption of these enhanced processes are effectively reduced compared with the original process in the literature. Among them, the thermal integrated process of liquid–liquid extraction combined with extractive distillation is the best design, which has a total annual cost of $32.656 × 105 and an energy consumption of 5936.94 kW. CONCLUSION: Compared with the original process, this process can save 71.33% of energy consumption. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - The presence of metallic species in biofuels has increased considerably during the last few years. The deposition of these species in non-metallic components of automotive engines can cause their degradation due to oxidative or catalytic processes, thus decreasing their useful life. Therefore, the problem imposes the need to implement methodologies with selectivity, sensitivity and adequate reproducibility in the detection of these inorganic species. This is the first study to determine the species Fe3+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Pb2+ and Cd2+ using boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrodes in an ethanolic medium with anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV). Thus, the ASV methodological parameters for accumulation time (Tacc), accumulation potential (Eacc), frequency (f) and amplitude (a) were optimized in different electrolyte media using BDD electrodes with a doping level of 8000 ppm in the determination of these metallic species. The limits of detection (LoD) and quantification (LoQ) were obtained from the analytical curves, reaching values (LoD) below 2 µg.L−1 for all species. After the optimization of the ASV parameters, tests were performed on samples collected from different gas stations in the municipality of Manaus, Brazil. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The current study investigates the opportunity of using olive mill wastewater (OMWW) as a renewable fuel in internal combustion engines. The biofuel was made from the hydrothermal conversion of OMWW using sub-/supercritical alcohol-water system. OMWW biofuel was blended with pure diesel (designated B0). Three blends namely B10, B20 and B30 containing respectively 10%, 20% and 30% by volume of biofuel were tested. This paper focuses on the experimental study of the performance, combustion and emission characteristics of a diesel engine using OMWW biofuel as a partial replacement of conventional diesel fuel. All experiments were performed with constant engine speed (1500 rpm). The engine load was varied from 20 to 100% of full load. It is found that B10 blend offers the best results, compared to B20 and B30, in terms of performance and pollutant emissions. Using B10 showed a lower emission levels for unburned hydrocarbons (12%), particulate matter (12%) and carbon monoxide (26%) under high load conditions, compared to that of B20. Moreover, under medium load conditions, B10 further reduced the concentration of pollutants such as particulate matter (55%) and carbon monoxide (65%) compared to that of B30. In addition, the use of B20 and B30 blends resulted in a lower thermal efficiency than that of diesel fuel. Conversely, the thermal efficiency obtained with B10 was the highest even compared to diesel fuel. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Along with an increasing demand for an alternate source of fossil fuel, rapid urbanization has increased the motor vehicle pollutant spews in a metropolis, especially in traffic congestion or cold start condition. In reference to these situations; this research is aimed at utilizing orange peel oil (OPO) as blend fuel to mineral diesel in light-duty diesel engine and asses the output characteristics for optimizing engine fuel map under idling condition. A four-factor central composite design (CCD) approach-based response surface methodology (RSM) analysis is applied to statistically relate the effect of important input variables on key engine characteristics to achieve minimum emissions without a major compromise on the power output. From the desirability report, for orange Peel Oil (20%) blended with diesel fuel (80%) (OPO20) fuel, the optimum pilot injection timing is 210 before top dead centre (bTDC), pilot mass of 24% and apt fuel injection pressure is 500 bar while maintaining 1100 rpm as idle engine speed. While tuning the OPO20 operated engine fuel map under this optimum operating condition, a notable reduction of 34% in carbon monoxide and 36.84% reduction in smoke is observed in comparison to diesel. However, the increased mean gas temperature in-turn translated into 37.65% increase in oxides of nitrogen. As a trade-off to the reduced emissions, a 15.47% decrease in the brake thermal efficiency is observed while the specific fuel consumption also increased by 29.98% in comparison to diesel operation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fuels from renewable biological resources are currently being used as an alternative or complement to petroleum-derived fossil fuels. The objective of this work was to investigate the degradation dynamics of commercially-available biodiesel blends (containing 1, 5 or 16% biodiesel, i.e. B1, B5 and B16) in soil simultaneously polluted with metals and biodiesel blends. To this purpose, soil was artificially polluted with 6,000 mg biodiesel blend per kg DW soil (B1, B5 or B16) and a mixture of metals: 1,500 mg Zn kg−1 DW soil + 500 mg Cu kg−1 DW soil + 50 mg Cd kg−1 DW soil. Artificially-polluted soils were then arranged in a phytotron under controlled conditions and monitored for 30 days. The bioremediation capacity of a bio-stabilized municipal solid waste, as organic amendment for biostimulation purposes, was evaluated. Soil health was monitored by measuring soil microbial indicators (biomass, activity and diversity parameters) and performing phytotoxicity bioassays with Cucumis sativus. The degradation of the fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) present in biodiesel was higher than that of the corresponding alkane homologues from diesel. The addition of the bio-stabilized municipal solid waste increased FAME degradation and microbial activity, and alleviated phytotoxicity. Cucumis sativus was more sensitive to pollution-induced effects than soil microbial communities. Our data showed that, after 30 days, organically-amended soils polluted with B16 experienced the greatest improvement in soil health (in the presence of the abovementioned metal mixture). It was concluded that biodiesel-containing fuel might cause a lower impact on soil health than diesel of fossil origin. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Thermodynamic properties of compressed fuels as density at liquids phase (PρT data) and two liquids-gas phases as saturated pressure, density, and temperature (PS,ρS,TS) are extremely important for engine performance as well as the transportation and storage of fuels. In this work single – and two–phase PρT data and liquid + gas phase equilibrium properties (PS,TS,ρS) of methyl octanoate (caprylate) as one of the key components of biofuels have been studied. The measurements were performed along 15 liquid and vapor isochores between (44.7 and 832.0) kg·m−3 over a temperature range from (298 to 438) K at pressures up to 17.33 MPa using a constant-volume piezometer technique. The study was concentrated in the two-phase region to accurately determine vapor-pressures and in the immediate vicinity of the phase-transition temperatures to precisely determine the phase boundary properties (PS,ρS,TS) on the liquid + gas equilibrium curve. In the low temperature range (far from the critical point) where the values of vapor-pressure are negligible small (&lt;1 kPa, approximately at temperatures below 350 K), the saturated vapor phase of methyl octanoate was considered as ideal gas with volume of VG=RT/PS and ΔVLG≈VG=RT/PS, where the saturated liquid volume can be neglected, VG&gt;&gt;VL. This approach was used to simplify the calculation of the thermodynamic properties of methyl octanoate at saturation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work assessed the impact of biodiesel impurities on CeO2 catalyst for soot combustion via soot-TPO experiments. The results showed that Na- and K-doped catalysts were assisted for soot combustion, while Ca- and P-doped catalysts had a negative effect. N2 adsorption-desorption and XRD results indicated that doping biodiesel impurities led to smaller surface area by blocking small pores. Surface chemical properties are suggested as major reasons for promoting soot combustion by means of XPS, H2-TPR, and O2-TPD. Na- and K-doped catalysts showed stronger redox ability and surface lattice oxygen mobility, poorly for Ca- and P-doped catalysts. Interestingly, a large number of surface oxygen species were observed on P-doped catalyst and it enhanced the ignition of bio soot. In the presence of NO, surface chemical properties including NOx storage/release capacity and NO oxidation ability were characterized by NO-adsorption DRIFTS, NO-TPO and NOx-desorption DRIFTS, alkali-doped catalyst with excellent NOx storage capacity that can release active oxygen species and gaseous NO2 accelerate heterogeneous soot combustion, and the poor NO conversion ability to NO2 that weakens the promotion effect of soot combustion. Particularly in the existence of P, the promotion effect of soot elimination in NO + O2 was further weakened by the reason of poor NOx storage capacity and NO oxidation ability. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The effects of neutralization, transesterification, and adsorption on the physicochemical properties of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) obtained from crude catfish oil (CO) were investigated. CO was recovered from catfish viscera and subjected to: neutralization (NCO) with 20 (g/100 g) NaOH solution, transesterification (BIO) with methyl alcohol (1:6 molar ratio, oil: alcohol) and 1 (g/100 g) (w/w) NaOH, and purification by adsorption (PBIO) with activated earth (10 g/100 g of BIO). CO, NCO, BIO, and PBIO were evaluated for FAME, free fatty acids (FFA), peroxide value (PV), cloud and flash points, free and total glycerin, rheological properties, and minerals. Catfish viscera had a lipid content of 28.5 g/100 g (wet basis), of which 20.9 g were recovered as CO (73.33% yield). Furthermore, 84.67 g of NCO, 77.53 g of BIO, and/or 60.22 g of PBIO were produced from 100 g of CO processed. NCO had significantly (P < 0.05) lower FFA, density, cloud point, flash point, and diacylglycerols content than CO. Meanwhile, PBIO had significantly (P < 0.05) lower PV and cloud points when compared to BIO. CO, NCO, BIO, and PBIO behaved as Newtonian fluids at 25 °C. BIO and PBIO adhere to the american society for testing and materials (ASTM) biodiesel standards for FAME, moisture, density, cloud point, free and total glycerin, Na, P, and S. This study demonstrated the feasibility of converting high-viscosity CO into low-viscosity PBIO with promising physicochemical attributes. PBIO has the potential to serve as a viable alternative biofuel. © 2021 AOCS

AB  - Oxygenated biofuels such as bioethanol and biodiesel are widely used as clean fuel additives in practical combustion devices to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and soot particles. Literature data showed that the effects of the oxygenates may differ under different combustion conditions. In particular, ethanol addition was seen to monotonically decrease soot formation in ethylene premixed flames. However, doping a small amount of ethanol would enhance soot formation in ethylene non-premixed flames. Although this dependence of the effects of ethanol doping on flame configuration has been observed experimentally, detailed kinetic explanation is yet to be presented. In this work, we performed a combined experimental and numerical study to explore the underlying mechanisms responsible for the reversal of the effects of ethanol addition on soot formation in partially premixed flames with increasingly higher level of partial premixing ratio. We showed experimentally that the soot synergistic effect of ethylene and ethanol as observed in non-premixed flames became weaker and eventually disappeared with the increase of the premixing ratio. These new findings suggest the important role of oxygen-related reactions in explaining the opposing effect of ethanol addition in non-premixed and premixed flames. Numerical simulations show that the presence of oxygen in partially premixed flames (PPF) enhance the formation of C1 species from ethylene; as a result, ethylene PPF exhibit low sensitivity to the additional C1 species produced from ethanol decomposition, which is the main reason for ethanol's soot enhancing effect in non-premixed flames of ethylene/ethanol mixtures. The opposing effect of ethanol addition on soot formation in non-premixed and premixed flames has finally been elucidated with kinetic information provided by our results on partially premixed flames. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A combined experimental and numerical characterization of a Compression Ignition (CI) engine is here presented under Diesel and Waste Vegetable Oil (WVO) fueling at different loads. Main objective is to prove the feasibility of preheated WVO as substitute of Diesel fuel in CI engine for cogeneration purposes without modifying the engine geometry. After a characterization of the WVO physical properties, an appropriate pre-heating system is mounted on the engine injection line in order to reduce viscosity. The in-cylinder pressure analysis reveals no significant differences under both fuelling modes, despite an increased fuel consumption measured for WVO. This last provides higher NOx, CO and CO2 emissions, with a strong reduction (50–80%) of the soot amount. The potential impact of employing WVO is then assessed through a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology with focus on the fuel production and use stages. A reduction in all the major impact categories is noticed with respect to Diesel fueling. At the same time, a 3D CFD model of the engine is developed and validated. The WVO injection process shows slower spray break-up and evaporation rates due to higher viscosity and density. Despite the higher penetration lengths and increased amount of fuel burnt closer to the cylinder walls, the soot at the exhausts remains low as a consequence of the absence of aromatic compounds and an enhanced oxidation process due to the presence of oxygen atoms in the WVO molecules. This aspect is also responsible of the increased NOx release. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Camelina sativa L. Crantz (Brassicaceae family), known as camelina, has gained new attention as a re-emerging oil seed crop. With a unique seed oil profile, with the majority of the fatty acids consisting of linolenic (C18:3), oleic (C18:1), linoleic (C18:2), and eicosenoic (C20:1), camelina oil is reported to be useful as a food oil and biofuel. However, there are still many unknown factors about the structure and genetic variability of this crop. Chromosomal localization of ribosomal DNA was performed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with 5S rDNA and 25S rDNA sequences as molecular probes on mitotic chromosomes of enzymatically digested root-tip meristematic cells. Here, we present for the first time a comparative analysis of selected genotypes (cultivars, breeding lines and mutants) of C. sativa with the use of cytogenetic techniques. The main aim of the study was to determine the intraspecific and interspecific polymorphisms in the structure of chromosomes of selected accessions using conserved 5S and 25S rDNA repetitive sequences as molecular probes. The results were compared with C. microcarpa (closely related to C. sativa) rDNA gene loci distribution. The presence of minor rDNA sites was discussed and compared with other Brassicaceae species. In addition, demonstration karyograms of C. sativa and C. microcarpa mapped with rDNA probes were prepared based on the cv. “Przybrodzka” and GE2011-02 genotype, respectively. The use of 5S and 25S rDNA probes provided an insight on the genome structure of C. sativa at the cytogenetic level and can help to understand the genome organization of this crop. The putative role of cytogenetic markers in phylogenetic analyses of camelina was discussed, as well. © 2021, Institute of Plant Genetics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Poznan.

AB  - The kinetics of the transesterification reaction has been explored theoretically. A general rate equation (GRE) was obtained for kinetics modeling of transesterification at the entire time of reaction based on a three-step mechanism. It has been shown that the GRE model converts to a Second-Order (SO) model at short initial times of reaction and it converts to Pseudo-First-Order (PFO) model at short initial times of reaction and high concentration of alcohol. Also, a modified form of the Second-Order model (MSO) was derived when the reaction is spontaneous (at ΔrG≪0 conditions or at short initial times of reaction). The accuracy of theoretical models and our assumptions was evaluated by three sets of experimental data selected at literature. It has been shown that the accuracy of PFO, SO, and MSO models followed the order of MSO &gt; SO &gt; PFO at short initial times while the GRE model is a suitable kinetics model at the entire times of reaction. Also, our research, contrary to what has been reported so far in published papers, shows that pseudo-first-order and second-order models are only accurate for kinetics modeling of the transesterification reaction at short initial times of reaction. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The continuous production of a diesel-like biofuel from palm oil was evaluated by coupling two reactions stages in series, pre-hydrogenation with a Ni/Al2O3 catalyst at 250 °C and LHSV of 2 h−1, followed by deoxygenation with a sulfided Ni–Mo/Al2O3 at 350–380 °C and LHSV of 1.6–3.3 h-1. The purpose of this process configuration was to improve the selectivity because side reactions on the double bonds, such as polymerization, ring formation and aromatization could be avoided. Both reactions were studied at 3 MPa. In the Ni catalyst, all the metal was in its reduced state and in three different types of cluster. The sulfided Ni–Mo catalyst had mainly sulfided MoSx and Ni-MoSx, but also appreciable amounts of reduced metal species, and the sulfided species were stable up to 500 °C. The pre-hydrogenation enabled the use of higher LHSV without losing conversion nor yield and this means that for a fix throughput, less deoxygenation catalyst can be used. The yield was decreased, at all experimental conditions evaluated, when pre-hydrogenation was not done, due to side reactions on the double bonds. The decarboxylation route was predominant (69.3%) followed by the decarbonylation (11.5%) and the hydrodeoxygenation routes (19.2%). The product had properties similar or superior to those of fossil diesel and biodiesel, with the exception of cold flow properties that were worse than those of fossil diesel but very similar to those of biodiesel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Consumers are becoming more aware of their role in the propagation of environmental issues, the transition from passive consumer to prosumer is emerging, and it is of interest to know the commitment factors that leads the biodiesel prosumer to act in favor of an organization which they belong in order to achieve one goal in common and contribute to local sustainable development. In this research, the prosumer is the one who participates as a member and consumer of a biodiesel cooperative. The prosumer's commitment is made up of two components: (i) nonactive or affective, identification with the organization, and (ii) active or participatory, action towards certain goals. The objectives of the investigation are to evaluate the biodiesel prosumer's commitment and know its causes and effects. The hypotheses on the causes and results of the prosumer's commitment are postulated in a structural equation model (SEM), whose theoretical basis corresponds to the double role of the prosumer: member and client of the cooperative. The SEM is evaluated from the perspective of the prosumer based on mixed methodology and partial least square (PLS). The proposed SEM explains 78% (R2 = 0.78) of the variability of the contribution of the biodiesel cooperative to local sustainable development, where this contribution is directly and significantly impacted by the two components of the commitment. This case study identifies dimensions that lead the biodiesel prosumer to commit in the cocreation and consumption of renewable fuel, which gives more opportunities for long-term survival of this initiative in a competitive market. © 2020 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Currently, developing high-performance non-noble metal catalysts for the conversion of biomass-derived compounds to valuable chemicals or biofuels remains a great challenge. Herein, surface CoFeOx-decorated bimetallic CoFe catalysts were developed via a Co-Mg-Fe layered double hydroxide precursor strategy and utilized for the transfer hydrogenolysis of 5-hydromethylfurfural (HMF) into 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) with the help of formic acid as the sustainable hydrogen donor. The as-fabricated CoFe bimetallic catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic performance with a high yield of DMF (>92%). Contrarily, monometallic Co-based catalyst delivered a much lower DMF yield. The structural characterizations and catalytic experiments demonstrated that the catalytic behavior of bimetallic CoFe catalysts was correlated with the appropriate combination of highly dispersed bimetallic metallic nanoparticles and abundant oxygen vacancies originating from surface CoFeOx species, as well as favorable surface basic sites, thereby facilitating the dehydrogenation of formic acid and improving the affinity for carbonyl reduction, which promoted the selective hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis of carbonyl or hydroxymethyl group in HMF and reaction intermediates. Furthermore, excellent structural advantages of as-fabricated CoFe catalyst, such as high alloying degree of CoFe and strong metal-support interactions, endowed it with good stability and regeneration performance. The present bimetal-defect interfacial engineering strategy may provide a potential guide for the rational design of high-performance non-noble-metal catalysts for a variety of heterogeneous catalysis processes in terms of the conversion of biomass source. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Electrocatalytic synthesis of valuable biofuels and chemicals from biomass-derived acids is a promising approach, but selectively producing deoxygenated hydrocarbons is still a great challenge. In this work, we investigated selective electrochemical decarboxylation of n-octanoic acid to produce hydrocarbons (n-tetradecane, n-heptane, and n-heptene) in a single electrolytic cell at room temperature. Pt nanoparticles with different morphologies (nanospheres, nanoflowers, and nanothorns) and further Pt nanothorns with different plane distributions on carbon fiber paper (CFP) were fabricated by a controllable electrodeposition method. The results proved that the Pt(311) plane has the best selectivity and intrinsic activity for decarboxylation products, especially for Kolbe hydrocarbons. The Pt(110) plane shows a similar intrinsic activity as the Pt(311) planes. High selectivity (75%), yield (35%), and Faraday efficiency (34%) for hydrocarbons were achieved over the Pt nanothorn (Pt-NT), which were approximately 1.6, 2.3, and 3.3 times that of Pt nanoflowers, Pt nanospheres, and Pt/C, respectively. The high electrocatalytic activity of Pt nanothorns was attributed to its high electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) and enhanced intrinsic activity derived from the high level of Pt(311) and Pt(110) planes. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Increasing the production of biofuels in some provinces of China may be affected by local water resources (WR). This study analyzed the life-cycle water footprint (WF) of second-generation and non-grain fuels in different natural and technical conditions in different provinces of China. The analysis was doing using the CROPWAT software model, comparing conversion technologies, a sensitivity analysis, uncertainty analysis, and a pressure analysis of local WR. The impact of biofuel on the WF and local water load in Northeast, Southwest, Northwest, Central, and South China were analyzed. Results show that the bio-ethanol of Bagasse and Cassava in Guangxi, Sorghum stalk in Jilin, and Paddy Rice straw and Corn cobs in Heilongjiang are the most favorable feedstocks for producing biofuel, with WFs ranging from to 152–967 m3/t. The proportions of grey WF to life-cycle WF for Sorghum straw (61.89%), Corn cob bio-ethanol (60.17%), and Rapeseed biodiesel (85.20%) in China should be reduced compared with the global average WF (less than 50%). The local WR load of Wheat straw in Henan was the highest (K = 1.13) and the local WR load of Bagasse in Guangxi was lowest (K = 0.06). Increasing the output, reducing the value fraction of the crop residue, and reducing chemical fertilizer consumption have the best effect on reducing WF. Biofuel development policies, including adopting well-designed management practices, controlling fertilizer use as much as possible, carrying out nearby bioenergy strategies, and implementing a local multi-cooperation model are proposed. These results can guide provincial decision-making to expand biofuel commercialization in China. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) has been developed as a technique for the rapid measurements of the oxidative stability of biodiesel fuels. Firstly, use of near-infrared spectroscopy for rapid determination of the oxidation level in biodiesel, a new calibration model was developed based on nine different biodiesel oxidation properties: conjugated diene value (CD), P-anisidine value (P-AV), Peroxide value (PV), Viscosity at 40 °C and 100 °C, Iodine Value (IV), Bis Allylic Position Equivalent (BAPE), Degree of Unsaturation factor, and values of the oxidative stability Index (OSI). Partial least squares regression and forward stepwise multiple linear regressions were used to quantify the spectral data with the using the second derivative of the spectra. In order to validate the calibration model, three separate biodiesel samples were used and analysed. In this work it is successfully demonstrated that NIR spectroscopy-based non-destructive technique gives fast measurements within less than 60 s of time and more accurate measurements with very low error of 1.1%. Statistical t-test showed that all the t-values of the validation samples were less than tc (t critical), giving t-value of 1.466 for linseed, 1.2556 for Algae and 0.4816 RME (Rapeseed Methyl Ester) compared with tc value of 2.365. This established that the proposed NIR method correlate well with the standard methods. The accuracy of the results for these samples for the different oxidative stability properties obtained from NIRS techniques was validated against the known value of all the oxidative properties and the percentage error was calculated and presented. © 2020

AB  - In this study, highly defected and functionalized metal-organic framework (MOF) structures are developed and exploited as catalysts for an esterification reaction for biofuel production. Two systems of multivariate UiO-66 series, namely MTV-UiO-66(COOH)2 and MTV-UiO-66(OH)2 incorporating dicarboxylate and dihydroxy groups, respectively, along with the single component structures, are thus explored for butyl butyrate production. Ratios of functionalized linkers to terephthalic acid are varied and a modulation synthesis approach is employed allowing for high levels of structural defects. The synthesized MOF structures are fully characterized using Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the results confirmed the homogeneous incorporation of the functionalized linkers in the structures. The combination of multivariate approach along with modulation synthesis yields structures with catalytic activity higher than those of highly defective fully functionalized structures and close to the homogeneous conventional catalyst used in esterification reactions. Moreover, the ratio of functionalized linkers to terephthalic acid is shown to be very important since not all MTV-UiO-66 performed better than the single-component structure which can be attributed to a combination of factors related to the density of active sites and their accessibility. The most active MTV-UiO-66(OH)2 member, incorporating 52% of functionalized linkers, a defects number of 1.9, and a surface area of 761 m2/g, yielded 92% conversion to butyl butyrate, compared to 95% for H2SO4, and its activity and stability is maintained over 4 consecutive cycles. Furthermore, by using the data of 33 different UiO-66 based catalysts for butyl butyrate production, a weighted linear regression model is suggested to predict the conversion based on the parameters that are concluded to mostly govern the catalytic activity of MOF catalysts. These parameters include the surface area, the catalytic loading, the defects number, and the level of incorporation of BDC, and the functionalized linkers. The weights calculated for each of these parameters indicate that there is a more pronounced effect of active sites density on the conversion when compared to the surface area or the catalyst loading. These conclusions help pave the way for the engineering of MOF-based catalysts in the path of bridging the gap between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis for efficient biofuel production. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Non-edible bio-oil derived from lignocellulosic biomass could be used as environmentally friendly lubricant-ester base stock for maritime and road-type transportations. However, the use of crude bio-oil with highly oxygenated compounds required further upgrading to yield ester that mimicked the characteristics of Group V base oil (polyolesters). In this study, bio-oil based polyolesters was produced via esterification using green biopolymer alginate acid catalyst (Al-Alg). The bio-oil compounds used were acetic acid (AcA), propionic acid (PrA) and levulinic acid (LA), while polyols such as neopentyl glycol (NPG), trimethylolpropane (TMP) and pentaerythritol (PE) were used. Optimization studies revealed that NPG-PrA ester gave the best ester purity of 100%, with 95% of diester selectivity under optimum conditions of 15 wt% Al-Alg, 8 h, 6:1 PrA:NPG and 140 °C. The produced polyolesters showed potential lube characteristics with viscosity index of 76, kinematic viscosity of 2.3 mm2 s−1 at 40 °C and oxidative induction time of 15 min at 100 °C. Furthermore, a reusability study of the Al-Alg catalyst indicated high NPG-PrA diester selectivity (above 90%) for 8 consecutive cycles. The physico-chemical properties of spent Al-Alg catalyst were also discussed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Pennycress can be used as a renewable biomass because its harvested seeds can be con-verted into biofuel, supplying, for example the aviation industry. Pennycress can be adopted as a winter cover crop to make extra profit in addition to summer cash crops. This study ascertains influences on row crop farmers’ interest in growing pennycress to supply a biofuels industry. The study uses data from a survey of row-crop farmers in seven US states. Effects of farm and farmer attributes on acceptance of a farmgate pennycress price are measured. Nearly 58% were interested in growing pennycress if profitable. Among those interested, 54.4% would accept the farmgate pen-nycress price offered. Positive influences on interest included farm size, education, and familiarity with pennycress, while concern about knowledge on growing pennycress, and use of no-till practices had negative influences. Farmers aged 40 to 65 were more likely to accept the price, while share of rented hectares and no debt had positive influences. More risk-averse farmers and those using no-till were less likely to accept. Results suggest that the majority of row crop farmers would be interested in growing pennycress if profitable, while the overall willingness to accept the farmgate price was when it was at $0.28/kg. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - This experimentation focuses on the diesel engine performance and emission characteristics using coconut biodiesel blends without any engine alterations. The fuel properties of diesel and biofuel blends are analyzed. The engine is capable of running without difficulty in biodiesel mode. Engine performance test interval is 200 rpm. And, emission tests have been carried out at maximum speed at 100%, 90% and 80% throttle position. Outcome of this experimentation showed that fall in brake power, while rise in specific fuel consumption has been identified for biodiesel over the entire speed range compared to sole fuel (diesel). In case of engine exhaust gas emissions, raising CO2 and diminishing HC, CO, Smoke Density and increasing of NOx emissions have been identified for biodiesel compared to diesel. Thus has been carried out at full load, keeping throttle 100% wide open with variable speeds at an, it can be concluded that BD1, BD2 and BD3 can be used in diesel engines without any engine modifications and have positive special effects both in terms of exhaust emission reductions and engine performance. This article pointed out that biofuel has potential to reduce greenhouse gas emission for more than 80%; which most of the developed countries have put their target and authorization to use biofuel. © 2021, Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society.

AB  - The fact that 60% of the Indian population is dependent on Agricultural practices for their livelihood means that there is a huge potential for the development of second-generation Biofuel. The current work involves the use of Azadirchta excelsa seeds to obtain biofuel. It is a commercial crop grown in Southern parts of India such as Karnataka. It is mainly grown to get timber for building houses and for manufacturing of match sticks. Soxhlet extraction method was used to extract oil from the seeds, with hexane being the choice of solvent and a yield of 35% was obtained. The oil was transesterified using Base (NaOH) catalyst method to produce oil methyl ester. The conversion rate of oil was found to be 50%. The physicochemical parameters of the biodiesel produced were analyzed of other basic parameters. The results lied within the range of American society of testing material (ASTM D6751) standards and Indian Standards (IS) 15607 specifications for biodiesel samples, which conclude that A.excelsa seed oil can be satisfactorily used as a feed-stock for biodiesel production. © 2021

AB  - Di-n-butyl ether (DBE), a promising lignocellulosic biofuel, has been suggested as a potential alternative fuel for compression ignition engines. In this study, the spray auto-ignition characteristics of diesel/DBE blends were experimentally measured on a constant volume combustion chamber. Time-resolved pressure traces and heat release rates in fuel spray combustion were measured at changed fuel blending fractions, ambient temperatures, and oxygen concentrations. Further, ignition delay and combustion delay that evaluates fuel spray ignition tendency were derived and compared for different test blends. Experimental results indicated that fuel spray ignition tendency is promoted with DBE addition, evidenced by the advanced pressure rise and heat release processes, and the shortened ignition and combustion delays. Peak heat release rates are fuel-dependent at high ambient oxygen concentrations since the relative fractions of the premixed and diffusive burns alter with changed DBE addition. However, as the oxygen concentration drops to 11%, fuel effects on the peak heat release rates become less noticeable. Reduced ambient oxygen concentration effectively extends fuel ignition and combustion delays, and typical two-stage pressure rises and heat releases are observed for all test blends, as the oxygen concentration drops to 11%. © 2020 by ASME

AB  - Small-scale plants that produce biodiesel have many social, economic and environmental advantages. Indeed, small plants significantly contribute to renewable energy production and rural development. Communities can use/reuse local raw materials and manage independently processes to obtain biofuels by essential, simple, flexible and cheap tools for self-supply. The review and understanding of recent plants of small biodiesel production is essential to identify limitations and critical units for improvement of the current process. Biodiesel production consists of four main stages, that are pre-treatment of oils, reaction, separation of products and biodiesel purification. Among lots of possibilities, waste cooking oils were chosen as cheap and green sources to produce biodiesel by base-catalyzed transesterification in a batch reactor. In this paper an overview on small-scale production plants is presented with the aim to put in evidence process, materials, control systems, energy consumption and economic parameters useful for the project and design of such scale of plants. Final considerations related to the use of biodiesel such as renewable energy storage (RES) in small communities are discussed too. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Microalgae are important green energy resources. With high efficiency in fixing carbon dioxide, microalgae are broadly applied for biofuel production. Integrating various cultivation parameters, we applied ultraviolet (UV) mutagenesis, one of the most common approaches, to induce genomic mutation in microalgae and thus enhance the production of lipid content, but the screening process is convoluted and labor-intensive. In this study, we aimed to develop an accessible microflu-idic platform to optimize the biofuel production of microalgae. Instead of traditional lithography, we designed hanging-drop microfluidic chips that were fabricated using a cheap computer numerical control (CNC) micro-milling technique. On each chip, we cultured in parallel Botryococcus braunii, one of the most common freshwater microalgae for biofuel production, in sets of ten separated hanging drops (~30 µL each); we monitored their growth in each individual drop for more than 14 days. To optimize the culturing conditions, using drops of varied diameter, we first identified the influence of cell density on algae growth and lipid production. After introducing UV-induced random mutations, we quantified the lipid content of the microalgae in situ; the optimized UV-C dosage was determined accordingly. In comparison with wild-type B. braunii, the results showed increased biomass growth (137%) and lipid content (149%) of the microalgae mutated with the desired UV process. Moreover, we showed a capacity to modulate the illumination on an addressed chip area. In summary, without using an external pump system, we developed a hanging-drop microfluidic system for long-term microalgae culturing, which can be easily operated using laboratory pipettes. This microfluidic system is expected to facilitate microalgae mutation breeding, and to be applied for algae cultivation optimization. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This study reports the application of metallo-stannosilicates as potential inorganic solid matrixes for enzymes immobilization and their use as a heterogenous catalysts in enzymatic transesterification reactions for the conversion of triacylglycerides into fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs). Several stannosilicates were synthesized and physicochemical characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM-EDS), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)-N2 surface area analysis and solid-state magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR 29Si and 119Sn nuclei) techniques. The experimental results for enzymes immobilization were promising, especially for a nickel ion-exchanged metallo-stannosilicate, which were able to immobilize 82 ± 6% of Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase and also kept a high enzymatic activity (42 ± 3 U mg–1). Systematic catalytic reactions for conversion of refined palm oil (Elaeis guineensis) using some of these stannosilicates enzymes complexes yielded 63.3 ± 0.7% of FAEEs. It is worth noticing that, when the transesterification reaction was performed with (a) the as-made stannosilicate without enzymes and (b) the equivalent amount of immobilized Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase in its free form, the FAEEs yield sharply decreased to &lt; 5.0% and 6.3 ± 0.3%, respectively. This result is a clear evidence of a synergistic effect among the metallo-stannosilicates and the immobilized enzymes. © 2021 Atlantis Livros Ltda.. All rights reserved.

AB  - Microbial lipids hold great promise as biofuel precursors, and research efforts to convert such lipids to renewable diesel fuels have been increasing in recent years. In contrast to the numerous literature reviews on growing, characterising and extracting lipids from oleaginous microbes, and on converting vegetable oils to hydrocarbon fuels, this review aims to provide insight into aspects that are specific to hydroprocessing microbial lipids. While standard hydrotreating catalysts generally perform well with terrestrial oils, differences in lipid speciation and the presence of co-extracted compounds, such as chlorophyll and sterols, introduce additional complexities into the process for microbial lipids. Lipid cleanup steps can be introduced to produce suitable feedstocks for catalytic upgrading. © 2021 Johnson Matthey.

AB  - Biodiesel fuels are used as an alternative fuel in internal combustion engines. In this study, the damaged vegetable oil (the vegetable oil after using in cooking) was mixing with methanol to produce biodiesel fuels and tested in a single cylinder 4- stroke engine. Gases emission and engine performance were recorded at constant speed and five load conditions. This experimental study measured NOx, CO, CO2 and O2 at the different biodiesel concentration. The emissions of gases and the performance of engine measured at five blending biofuels and five load conditions and at constant speed. The blending ratios of biodiesel with diesel fuel based by volume were set at 0% (pure fuel), 5%, 10%, 20% and 30%, throughout this work denoted as 0S, 5S, 10S, 20S and 30S. The results show that, at higher content of biodiesel fuel, biodiesel exhibited better emission CO and CO2, the reduction percent of these emission gases reach to 46% and 22% respectively. Also, the exhaust temperature gases reduction reach to 20%. Also, the obtained results found that the decrease values of break power and thermal efficiency. Furthermore, NOx increased when the content of biodiesel increases. © 2021 Taylor's University. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper explores several renewable energy sources to help Malaysia reduce its carbon footprint. Accordingly, this study employs a partial equilibrium model to examine the potential of the Malaysian agricultural sector to supply biodiesel, bioethanol, and bioelectricity on a commercial scale to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG). The model includes the fourteen agricultural commodities of Malaysia. The results show that bioethanol is economically feasible with its fossil fuel counterpart, while bioelectricity is almost economically feasible. Both bioethanol and bioelectricity have the potential to offset significant GHG emissions of fossil fuels. Furthermore, this study finds that biodiesel has little mitigation on GHG emissions and cannot compete with diesel. Biodiesel also would expand the agricultural industry, which could raise agricultural prices and hasten deforestation. Therefore, the Malaysian government should further study bioethanol and bioelectricity as two candidates to supply renewable energy and help the nation meets its GHG commitment under the Paris Agreement. This study highlights further research for cellulosic ethanol because it is still in the experimental stage. © 2021

AB  - Facing increasing pressure to decarbonize, innovation within the shipping sector has turned to low-and zero carbon solutions. In this paper we investigate how the development and implementation of biodiesel and liquefied biogas (LBG) in Norwegian coastal shipping has been influenced by the technological alignment with fossil fuels. We understand this influence to emanate from the (mis)match of biofuels with the structure of coastal shipping (e.g. infrastructure, knowledge, institutions, actors) which has been shaped by fossil fuels. This way we contribute to the development of Technological Innovation Systems (TIS) framework by discussing the effect of sectoral cross-technology externalities on the functionality of a TIS. Our core data consists of semi-structured interviews, supported by a firm survey with Norwegian shipowners. Our results show that the technological alignment provides the biodiesel and LBG TISs with several benefits, such as access to established markets and infrastructure, which suggests that Norway to some extent has good conditions for maritime biofuel markets to form. However, two major barriers for implementation of biofuels are fuel availability and cost. Considering the competition with battery-electric and hydrogen solutions, the positive externalities of the interchangeability between fossil and biofuels are insufficient to make biodiesel and LBG competitive contenders for coastal shipping. In order to upscale implementation of biofuels in the Norwegian coastal shipping sector, which is needed to reach national and international emission targets, there is a need for strengthened policy interventions. To establish market formation, subsidies for biofuels and feed-in targets would be crucial policy instruments. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - We apply an encompassing framework to assess the viability of hedging spot biodiesel price risk for four U.S. markets with a conventionally used heating oil futures contract and a soybean oil futures contract based on the logic that supply shifts (i.e., price of soybean oil as an input) drive biodiesel prices when binding blending mandates are in place. Results indicate that soybean oil futures should in fact be part of a composite hedge, and that in some instances greater hedging weight should be placed on the soybean oil futures contract than the conventionally used heating oil futures contract. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, the simultaneous effect of microwave-ultrasound (MW + US) irradiations was compared with those of microwave (MW) and ultrasound (US) applied individually for the depolymerization of Kraft lignin in a hybrid microwave-ultrasound high pressure chemical reactor. The bio-oils obtained upon depolymerization were analyzed by GC–MS, CHNS, MALDI-TOF-MS, 2D-HSQC NMR, TGA and FTIR techniques. The highest bio-oil yield of 48.2% was obtained upon depolymerization of Kraft lignin with hybrid MW + US irradiations for 1 h under autogenous pressure while only 42.1% and 25.5% bio-oil yields were obtained for MW and US irradiations, respectively. MALDI-TOF MS spectra suggested the presence of significant amount of dimers in the bio-oil obtained over hybrid MW + US process than US and MW processes. The simultaneous effect of MW and US reduced the repolymerization of reaction intermediates thus favoring relatively low residue and high bio-oil yield. 2D-HSQC NMR demonstrated considerable degradation of the representative inter-unit linkages (β-O-4 and β-5). The HHVBoie of the bio-oils obtained over US (29.28 MJ/Kg) and MW + US (29.21 MJ/Kg) irradiations were quite comparable. Although the thermal stability of the bio-oils followed the order MW &gt; MW + US &gt; US, the bio-oil obtained over hybrid MW + US was superior in both quality and quantity than obtained over MW and US irradiations. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Global demand for energy is rapidly increasing, and resources for the production of petroleum-based fuels are running out. For this, renewable fuels like biodiesel and hydrotreated vegetable oil biofuel are considered important alternatives to replace such fuels. In this study, we evaluated the in vitro genotoxicity effect on HepG2 cells of organic material extracted from particulate matter emissions of an engine fueled with conventional diesel or mixtures of diesel with 10% of biomass. The emissions were collected in two operational modes, 2410 rpm (slope simulation) and 1890 rpm (plane). Genotoxicity was evaluated through two methods, chromosomal aberration test and the alkaline comet assay. The former did not show any genotoxic effect, but the latter exhibited a statistically significant effect despite the operational mode of the engine and the concentration organic material extracted. In conclusion, regardless of the concentration of organic material extracted from particulate matter, the operational mode of the engine, or the fuel used, a significant damage of the DNA was found. In general, at the physicochemical level, a decrease in the amount of emissions of the used fuels is not directly related to a decrease in the genotoxicity potential. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Concerns about the environment have been an important topic of global debate, and the energy sector is largely responsible for environmental negative impacts. Thus, several countries have been opting to use renewable fuels, such as biodiesel, despite it, the combustibility properties of this fuel are still not ideal. To improve these characteristics, this study proposes to use natural compounds as additives in babassu biodiesel. Biodiesel was produced by the babassu oil transesterification process, and the additive mixtures were carried out by factorial design. Were analyzed the properties of density, viscosity, freezing point, cloud point, and cold filter clogging point and found that there was an improvement in all fuel properties, the most expressive in the mixture containing 0% isoamyl alcohol; 7% camphor; and 7% limonene. Results that show a positive trend to use natural compounds as antifreeze additives in biodiesel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Due to abundant availability of shale gas and biogas, methane has been considered as one of the most potential carbon sources for industrial biotechnology. Methanotrophs carrying the native methane monooxygenase are capable of using methane as a sole energy and carbon source, which provides a novel strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emission and substituting edible substrates used in bioconversion processes. With the rapid development of genetic engineering tools and biosynthesis techniques, various strategies for improving the efficiency of methane bioconversion have been achieved to produce a variety of commodity bio-based products. Herein, we summarize several important aspects related with methane utilization and metabolic engineering of methanotrophs, including the modification of methane oxidation pathways, the construction of efficient cell factories, and biosynthesis of chemicals and fuels. Finally, the prospects and challenges of the future development of methane bioconversion are also discussed. © 2021 Chin J Biotech, All rights reserved

AB  - The application of renewable jet fuel is an eco-friendly technique that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Based on existing commercial processes, this study aimed to evaluate the hydro-conversion processes for producing renewable jet fuel. Three process scenarios were compared, in which the feedstock used cooking oil (UCO) is converted to hydroprocessed renewable jet fuel (HRJ) and its byproducts. Then, the investment feasibility of the three processes was evaluated through an economic analysis and predicted by an uncertainty analysis. The results show that if the main product (HRJ) is the profit target, one-step conversion is the best choice. However, if we consider the overall economic benefits, the three-step conversion method is more suitable with an average more 11.94% chance of profiting than the one-stage under uncertain analysis, which means it is a considerably competitive approach with lower risk and only 0.31 $/L of minimum selling price of jet fuel (MJSP), because it has the advantages of a wider range application and higher value of byproducts which reduce the risk of a single factor contribution. From the sensitivity analysis, jet fuel price is the key factor which contributes 75–82% for one- and two-stage processes, but UCO price in three-stage process reach nearly 50%. In addition, due to the economic scale, scaling up the plant capacity will lead higher economic benefits. Therefore, an efficient UCO recovery system and three-stage process are the keys for the industrial development aspect through the value-chain analysis under uncertainty. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Mixtures of n-hexadecane and 2,2,4,4,6,8,8-heptamethylnonane are common diesel fuel surrogates. This paper describes a systematic investigation of the liquid-liquid phase behavior of the ternary mixtures of the normal alkane n-hexadecane and its isomer 2,2,4,4,6,8,8-heptamethylnonane (both CnH2n+2; n = 16) with ethanol as a model system of surrogate fuels. By applying the cloud point method in the temperature range of T = 240-330 K at ambient pressure (p = 1013 mbar), the complete liquid-liquid phase diagram is obtained. The binary mixtures of the alcohol with both isomeric alkanes show partial miscibility with upper critical solution points. The behavior of the ternary mixtures is examined by investigating the quasi-binary subsystems of mixtures of the alcohol with mixtures of the two isomers for various fixed mole ratios. By changing the ratio of the different isomers, the region of the phase diagram of the alcohol mixture with the n-alkane is gradually shifted toward lower temperatures when adding the branched isomer toward the phase diagram of the binary mixture of the alcohol with the isomeric compound. The general shape of the phase bodies of the pseudobinaries, predefined by the ratio of the isomeric components, shows only a slight change. For the numerical analysis of the measured phase behavior of the pseudobinary mixtures, concepts are used that are applied for binary solutions presuming Ising criticality. A master curve is obtained when applying the corresponding state principle on the binary and the pseudobinary mixtures. Superposition of the different results allows for a comprehensive description of the liquid-liquid phase behavior, and it estimates the loci of critical line and tie lines. The limits of the range of validity of the descriptions are determined by the appearance of solid phases, which are also reported here. This study is expected to establish a basis for optimizing blends of petrochemical fuels and fuels from renewable sources. © 2021 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society.

AB  - Ketohydroperoxides (KHPs) are oxygenated hydrocarbons that include carbonyl and peroxide functional groups. The decomposition pathways of KHPs are chain branching pathways in low temperature chemistry of alkanes and oxygenated biofuels, which makes KHPs critical intermediates in ignition processes in advanced combustion engines. In this work, KHP formation was investigated in the low temperature oxidation of a primary reference fuel (PRF 70), a binary mixture of 30 vol% n-heptane and 70 vol% iso-octane to represent a low octane number gasoline surrogate. Species were detected and measured in a jet-stirred reactor (JSR), coupled with time-of-flight molecular beam mass spectrometer using synchrotron vacuum-ultraviolet radiation as photon ionization source (SVUV-PI-TOF-MBMS) which provides in-situ measurement of unstable KHPs. Simultaneous KHPs production from higher reactivity n-heptane and lower reactivity iso-octane at similar temperatures was observed. Kinetic modeling was used to study the reactivity across a wide temperature range and to examine KHP formation chemistry. Specifically, signals vs. temperature profiles in experiments and mole fraction vs. temperature profiles in simulations, were compared to indicate the most possible saturated KHP isomers. Possible formation pathways for olefinic KHPs and di-olefinic KHPs are discussed. This work reports simultaneous formation of KHPs from two fuel molecules in a gasoline surrogate mixture, discusses important reaction pathways in low temperature oxidation, and explains simultaneous KHP production in n-heptane/iso-octane mixtures, i.e., low temperature oxidation of less reactive iso-octane is initiated by OH radicals produced from high reactivity n-heptane oxidation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An increasing number of on-road vehicles have increased the average duration of the engine's low-load and speed operation. This prolonged status of engine running is called idling and is the source of higher fuel consumption, increased engine wear, and spiked emissions. Also, to address the twin crisis of fossil fuel scarcity and higher engine-out emissions the present-day vehicles need suitable alternate fuels. Blending of Orange Peel Oil (OPO) with diesel is a promising solution to contain the reparations caused by idling emissions and fuel consumption. However, to ensure complete functionality of the OPO-diesel blend during idling, the combustion, vibrations, and sound characteristics need to be analysed. Hence, the present work calibrates the engine operating parameters for vibro-acoustic and combustion characteristics of a commercial vehicle diesel operating under idling conditions for pure diesel and OPO blends (10% and 20%). Vibrations, sound levels, and combustion characteristics were measured for diesel, OPO 10, and OPO 20 fuel blends. Experiments were conducted as per the Design of Experiments determined by Central Composite Design and the engine parameters were calibrated based on the optimised results using Response Surface Methodology. The results revealed that OPO20 performs better than OPO10 compared to pure diesel, as it displayed similar vibration characteristics and improved heat release rate by 8% while maintaining the same noise levels. The only deviation in vibration behaviour is at the engine mount which reported of 77% average increase along all three axes, while vibration in all other test points varied within a range of 5%. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The limitation of fossil fuel sources and negative environmental impact persuade scientists around the world to find a solution. One possible solution is by using renewable fuel to replace fossil fuel with an inexpensive, fast, and effective production process. The objective of this study is to investigate the biodiesel production from crude Reutealis trisperma oil using the conventional and the ultrasonic bath stirrer method through the esterification and transesterification process. The result shows that the most effective reaction time with an optimum condition for the esterification and transesterification of Reutealis trisperma oil is at 2 h 30 min by using the ultrasonic bath stirrer method. The optimum conditions at a temperature of 55◦ C for the esterification and at 60◦ C for transesterification with 2% (v/v) of sulphuric acid with catalyst concentration of 0.5 wt.% were a methanol-to-oil ratio of 60%, and agitation speed of 1000 rpm. This optimum condition gives the highest yield of 95.29% for the Reutealis trisperma biodiesel. The results showed that the ultrasonic bath stirrer method had more effect on the reaction time needed than using the conventional method and reduced half of the conventional method reaction time. Finally, the properties of Reutealis trisperma biodiesel fulfilled the ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 biodiesel standards with density, 892 kg/m3; pour point, −2◦ C; cloud point, −1◦ C; flash point, 206.5◦ C; calorific value, 40.098 MJ/kg; and acid value, 0.26 mg KOH/g. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - In recent years, biodiesel has been demonstrated to offer a suitable level of reliability and attracted the attention of many researchers. Accordingly, various studies have been carried out to account for the biodiesel production and application, producing valuable reports and findings. In this research study, the effects of biodiesel on engine noise were studied on the basis of a time-frequency analysis. To do so, the acquired acoustic signal was initially filtered and denoised. Then the signal was transferred to the time-frequency SPL domain using short-time Fourier transform. In the A weighted signal, the SPL of all treatments were compared using an innovative visual technique. In this novel approach, the values of area percentages of the obtained SPL in the time-frequency domain were used to compare the propagated noise due to variables. The method revealed a consistent trend for all fuel blends at all engine rotational speeds. The analysis results showed that B10 (10% methyl/ethyl ester and 90% diesel fuel) and B30 had the lowest and highest A-Weighted SPL, respectively. Additionally, it was found that the engine had a maximum sensitivity for all fuel blends at an engine rotation speed of 1600 RPM. Moreover, Z-weighted (linear) signal processing was used to investigate what happens in a complete thermodynamic cycle at 1600 RPM. The developed time- frequency methodology successfully exposed all of the important acoustic events of the engine. The results of this study showed that the most effective acoustic events in engine noise were combustion, piston slap, and outlet valve closing. Furthermore, higher percentages of biodiesel blends resulted in longer combustion duration. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Today one of the most interesting ways to produce biodiesel is based on the use of oleaginous microorganisms, which can accumulate microbial oil with a composition similar to vegetable oils. In this paper, we present a thermo-chemical numerical model of the yeast biodiesel production process, considering cardoon stalks as raw material. The simulation is performed subdividing the process into the following sections: steam explosion pre-treatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, lipid production, lipid extraction, and alkali-catalyzed transesterification. Numerical results show that 406.4 t of biodiesel can be produced starting from 10,000 t of lignocellulosic biomass. An economic analysis indicates a biodiesel production cost of 12.8 USD/kg, thus suggesting the need to increase the capacity plant and the lipid yield to make the project economically attractive. In this regard, a sensitivity analysis is also performed considering an ideal lipid yield of 22% and 100,000 t of lignocellulosic biomass. The biodiesel production costs related to these new scenarios are 7.88 and 5.91 USD/kg, respectively. The large capacity plant combined with a great lipid yield in the fermentation stage shows a biodiesel production cost of 3.63 USD/kg making the product competitive on the current market of biofuels by microbial oil. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The problem of microbial growth in fuels, especially biofuels, is a very important issue. Water is a necessity for microbial growth to occur. Unfortunately, it is very hard to exclude all water from fuel systems during daily operations, especially when biodiesel is added to the fuel mix. The aim of this work was to investigate the impact of ionizing radiation on selected properties of fatty acids methyl esters in order to evaluate the possibility of using irradiation techniques to sterilize biodiesel and its blends. Ionizing radiation influences the chemical composition of biodiesel samples containing especially unsaturated bonds. Irradiation was performed in a specially designed flow system. The tested parameters were compared with the normative values from the ISO 14214 standard. Density, kinematic viscosity, flash point, water content and cold filter plugging point as a macroscopic parameters do not change despite their irradiation with ionizing radiation. Change was observed in microscopic parameters as oxidation stability and esters content. During irradiation, Rapeseed Methyl Ester (RME) samples formed oxidation products, which lower the oxidative stability. It was observed that, for esters content, requirements of the standard could be met in the case of using very small doses. In the case of RME samples saturated with water, the changes in the ester concentration were smaller, but the resulting products decreased the oxidation stability. Sterilization fatty acids methyl esters (FAME) was observed with the use of e beam radiation is to apply very low doses (up to 2 kGy) in a flow system without adding water. Sterilization FAME saturated by water requires the use of higher doses of radiation, which adversely affects the oxidative stability. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Global solid biofuel stove emissions strongly impact air quality, climate change, and human health. However, investigations of the impacts of global solid biofuel stove emissions on human health associated with PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm) and ozone (O3) are limited. Here, we quantify the impacts of global solid biofuel stove emissions on ambient PM2.5 and O3 air quality and the associated human health effects for the year 2010, using the Community Atmosphere Model coupled with Chemistry version 5.3. Annual mean surface PM2.5 concentrations from global solid biofuel stove emissions averaged over 2006–2010 are up to 23.1 μg m−3, with large impacts found over China, India, sub-Saharan Africa, and eastern and central Europe. For surface O3 impacts, we find that global solid biofuel stove emissions lead to increases in surface O3 concentrations by up to 5.7 ppbv for China, India, and sub-Saharan Africa, and negligible impacts or reductions of up to 0.5 ppbv for the US, Europe, and parts of South America. Global solid biofuel stove emissions for the year 2010 contribute to 382,000 [95% confidence interval (95CI): 349,000–409,000] annual premature deaths associated with PM2.5 and O3 exposure, with the corresponding years of life lost as 8.10 million years (95CI: 7.38–8.70 million years). Our study highlights air quality and human health benefits of mitigating emissions from the global solid biofuel stove sector, especially over populous regions of low-income and middle-income countries, through promoting clean household energy programs for the residential energy supply. © 2021.

AB  - Biogas is a significant renewable fuel derived by sources of biological origin. One of today’s research issues is the effect of biofuels on engine efficiency. The experiments on the engine are complicated, time consuming and expensive. Furthermore, the evaluation cannot be carried out beyond the permissible limit. The purpose of this research is to build an artificial neural network successfully for dual fuel diesel engine with a view to overcoming experimental difficulties. Authors used engine load, bio-gas flow rate and n-butanol concentration as input parameters to forecast target variables in this analysis, i.e., smoke, brake thermal efficiency (BTE), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC), nitrous-oxide (NOx ). Estimated values and results of experiments were compared. The error analysis showed that the built model has quite accurately predicted the experimental results. This has been described by the value of Coefficient of determination (R2 ), which varies between 0.8493 and 0.9863 with the value of normalized mean square error (NMSE) between 0.0071 and 0.1182. The potency of the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (NSCE) ranges from 0.821 to 0.8898 for BTE, HC, NOx and Smoke. This research has effectively emulated the on-board efficiency, emission, and combustion features of a dual-fuel biogas diesel engine taking the Swish activation mechanism in artificial neural network (ANN) model. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Yearly, large amounts of waste cooking oil are produced, which are discharged to urban sewage system. However, majority of them is recyclable and can be re-used as biodiesel fuel. When using biodiesel fuels, one way to improve the engine performance is to use nano additives. This study investigates the biodiesel fuel with different ratios of Al2O3-SiO2nanocomposite additive (Al0%- Si100%, Al25%-Si75%, Al50%-Si50%, Al75%-Si25%and Al100%-Si0%) at full load and four different nanocomposite concentrations (30, 60, 90 and 120 ppm). The Hybrid ANN-ABC modelling was conducted for two cases: a) finding and applying the most effective properties as network inputs; and b) total properties as inputs showed that the most effective properties have higher performance. The fuels B5Al60Si60 and B5Al9Si21 showed the highest brake power; the fuels B5Al0Si60 and B5Al120Si0 showed the lowest brake power, indicating that the interactions of nanoparticles in the composite mode had positive effects on brake power. The performance improvement using nano-composite additive was more than that of the nanoparticles individually. © 2021 Sciendo. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, seed productivity and oil content of three safflower genotypes (IMAMT 1750, IMAMT 946 and IMAMT 894) cultivated in the Brazilian semi-arid region were evaluated to identify which genotype has the best in-field performance. The acidity and saponification index were evaluated, as well as the efficiency of lipid extraction through thermal analysis, aiming to estimate the species' potential for biofuel production in semi-arid regions. Field cultivation under semi-arid conditions lasted for ~75 days and no herbivory were observed on the plants. The IMAMT 894 genotype presented higher seed yield than the other genotypes, IMAMT 1750 presented 34% oil, and IMAMT 946 and IMAMT 894 presented 32% oil with efficient extraction in the Soxhlet system and high oil content and quality; higher than traditionally used crops such as soybean and cotton. The IMAMT 894 genotype showed higher seed productivity, but all three genotypes presented good oil yield and quality for biodiesel production. Oil extraction in the Soxhlet system was efficient since the thermogravimetric analysis showed no oil in the residual biomass after oil extraction. © 2021 AOCS

AB  - The increasing use of renewable biofuels in the transportation sector has driven attention on the incompatibility issues between biofuels and the polymeric materials used in the vehicle fuel system. Here, the ageing effects on a polyoxymethylene copolymer exposed to four types of fuels; petroleum diesel, biodiesel, a commercial mixture of these, and hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO) at demanding high-temperature conditions, were investigated and compared with its performance in air. The degree of material degradation during ageing was highest in the presence of the non-polar fuels (HVO/petroleum diesel). The samples aged in different fuels underwent the same increase in crystallinity due to annealing. Surface powdering was observed on the sample aged in the fuel mixture. The negative effects from a combination of plasticization and swelling, induced by the sorbed fuel, oxidation and surface cracks dominated the changes in mechanical properties, leading to reduced stiffness, strength and extensibility. The results indicate that care should be taken when choosing this polymer in contact with, especially, non-polar fuels at severe conditions. © 2021

AB  - The dominance of private vehicles in the Indonesian transport modal mix has led to an enormous energy demand from oil and transport-related externalities. In 2018, to increase the sustainability of the automotive industry, the Indonesian government established an industrial roadmap with strong links to the national energy policy and CO2 emission reduction targets. The present manuscript proposes a model that could enable a quantitative projection of oil demand, CO2 emissions and assess the impact of proposed policy initiatives under the Activity, Mode Share, Intensity, and Fuel Choice (ASIF) framework. The results showed that improvements in vehicle fuel economy and the adoption of alternative fuels―such as bioethanol, biodiesel, and electricity―could reduce oil and CO2 emissions by up to 30.8% and 33.2%, respectively, as compared to the business as usual (BAU) case by 2030. The most significant contribution was derived by adopting policies related to biofuel blending: bioethanol (E−10) and biodiesel (B-50) reduced oil emissions by up to 5.44% and 10.30%, respectively. The electrified vehicle policy and improvements related to the new vehicle fuel economy contributed a combined 10.38% reduction. Meanwhile, the mandatory use of CNG made a contribution of only 0.98%. The end-of-life vehicle (ELV) retirement policy was also evaluated, with the results showing that it could contribute up to 3.49%. The findings suggest that the roadmap should be restructured to include a specific biofuel blend ratio mandate and new vehicle fuel economy targets. Additionally, a step-by-step implementation timeline needs to be established to enable a sufficient transition period during which the industry sector can adjust. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Ethanol produced from renewable biomass, such as lignocellulosic feedstock, is one of the most promising future biofuels. In this paper, rapeseed straw was tested as an abundant and cost-effective renewable resource material for the production of cellulosic glucose. Pre-treatment of this material is an important step to improve the efficiency of subsequent cellulose hydrolysis. In this study, we used two pre-treatment methods – hydrothermochemical and ultrasound. Studies have shown that, in the initial hydrothermal pre-treatment of rapeseed straw, Al2(SO4)3 may be used as an efficient catalyst, at least in procedures for obtaining glucose. An increase in the amount of this catalyst was accompanied by higher yields of both furfural and glucose. Additional pre-treatment of lignocellulosic residue with ultrasound resulted in considerable improvements in the results from further enzymatic hydrolysis. The application of two enzymes at the hydrolysis stage also increased the amount of glucose obtained. It was shown that the additional use of ultrasound increased the glucose amount by 21–29 % after enzymatic hydrolysis with two types of enzymes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this research, for the first time a mixture of diesel-biodiesel-water-bionanoparticles was prepared to simultaneously optimize the fuel consumption, reduce pollutant emission, and enhance the performance of diesel engines. To this end, graphene quantum dots as biodegradable nanoparticles were synthesized through the hydrothermal method. In this respective, the synthesized quantum dot nanoparticles were added at the concentrations of 20, 60, and 100 ppm along with 1, 5, and 10 vol% distilled water to the B15 fuel (the diesel fuel containing 15 vol% biodiesel). The results obtained from the engine experiments exhibited that when water and quantum dots were added simultaneously to the B15 fuel, the engine power was increased and the brake specific fuel consumption was reduced. In addition, the emissions of pollutants including HC, NOx and soot were decreased. However, the soot emission was slightly increased by adding the nanoparticles. For the sample containing 5% water and 60 ppm graphene quantum dot nanoparticles, the engine power was improved by 13.6% and the brake specific fuel consumption was reduced by 7.8% compared to those of the B15 pure fuel. Furthermore, emissions of pollutants including NOx, HC, and soot were decreased by 3.8, 29.2, and 33.7%, respectively, compared with the B15 pure fuel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Triacylglycerols (TAGs) are starting materials for the production of biolipid-based fuels such as biodiesel and biojet fuel. While various microorganisms can produce TAGs from renewable resources, the cultivation of TAG-producing microorganisms under sterilization conditions to avoid microbial contamination and application of solvent to extract TAGs from the TAG-filled microorganisms are costly. To overcome these challenges, this study reports the feasibility of a non-sterile cultivation of an oleaginous bacterium Rhodococcus opacus PD631SpAHB under saline conditions, followed by the use of a solvent-free, phage-lysis-protein-based bioextraction approach for TAGs release. The engineered strain PD631SpAHB was developed by introducing a recombinant plasmid carrying a phage lytic gene cassette (pAHB) into Rhodococcus opacus PD631 via transformation, followed by adaptive evolution under saline conditions. This newly developed strain is a salt-tolerant strain with the inducible plasmid pAHB to enable TAGs release into the supernatant upon induction. Cell lysis of PD631SpAHB was confirmed by the decrease of the optical density of cell suspension, by the loss of cell membrane integrity, and by the detection of TAGs in the culture medium. Up to 38% of the total TAGs accumulated in PD631SpAHB was released into supernatant after the expression of the lytic genes. PD631SpAHB strain is a promising candidate to produce TAGs from non-sterile growth medium and release of its TAGs without solvent extraction - a new approach to reduce the overall cost of biolipid-based biofuel production. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - ϕ-sensitivity is the change in ignition delay time (IDT) with respect to the fuel-to-air equivalence ratio (ϕ). High ϕ-sensitivity is a desirable fuel property for applications in advanced compression ignition and multi-mode engine designs. Understanding how ϕ-sensitivity depends on chemical structure is essential for selecting promising biofuels from the ever-growing list of proposed candidates. In this study, we investigate the effect of chemical structure on ϕ-sensitivity with experiment, simulation, and theory. Experimental Advanced Fuel Ignition Delay Analyzer (AFIDA) measurements for 2,4-dimethylpentane and diisopropyl ether provide evidence that branching and functional groups strongly impact ϕ-sensitivity. Further insights into this dependence are obtained with 0-D kinetic simulations with existing mechanisms for n-pentane, diethyl ether, 3-pentanone, n-heptane, 2-methylhexane, 2,4-dimethylpentane, and 2,2,3-trimethylbutane. Quantum mechanical (QM) G4 calculations of low-temperature reactions help explain the observed experimental and simulation trends. Specifically, these QM calculations provide theoretical estimates of the ketohydroperoxide (KHP) dissociation rates, the HO2 formation rates from peroxy radical (ROO), and the “cross-over” temperatures, i.e., the temperature at which ROO dissociation is favored compared to hydroperoxyl radical (QOOH) formation. Each of these reaction rates is compared to the n-alkane reference point to determine the impact of branching and different functional groups. Although kinetic mechanisms typically assume that KHP dissociation rates are invariant of chemical environment, our QM results suggest that this rate can span a range of roughly two orders of magnitude. We also discuss the importance of including the peroxy-hydroperoxy (OO-OOH) hydrogen transfer reaction for branched ethers. Finally, the insights gained assist in proposing a highly ϕ-sensitive compound, namely, isopropyl propyl ether. © 2020

AB  - Ceiba pentandra, non-edible oil (acid value of 21 mg KOH/g estimated using ASTM D664 methodology) is employed as a source for producing biodiesel using lipase immobilized on mesoporous material as a catalyst. Optimum conditions for maximum yield (96.4%) were the temperature of 33 °C, methanol to oil molar ratio of about 13.3:1 with a water content of 14.5%. From the reusability studies, it can be observed that greater than 85% conversion could be obtained up to 10 cycles, thereby proving the significant efficacy of the catalyst. Density, flash point, cloud point, calorific value, and cetane number of the produced biodiesels were 885 kg/m3, 152 °C, −3 °C, 38.44 kJ/kg and 57.2, respectively meeting the ASTM standards specified for biodiesel. The performance and emissions characteristics of 20% biodiesel (CIB20) and petroleum diesel were studied in a VCR under varying speeds in a full load condition. Blended biofuel showed a 13% lower mean brake power (BP) and 25% higher mean specific fuel consumption (SFC) compared to diesel fuel. Though NOx emission of the blended diesel was 31% higher than that of petroleum diesel, Hydrocarbon, CO2, and CO emissions were 8.4%, 13.7%, and 5.08% lower than that of diesel fuel, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Accurate knowledge of the components in the purification of biodiesel is important in achieving consistency in quality for the separation and purification process. In this paper, ternary phase diagrams were used to study the phase separation and purification of tropical almond biodiesel at temperatures of 20 °C, 30 °C and 40 °C. The biodiesel was produced using alkaline transesterification of the seed oil. The biodiesel was characterized using ASTM and EN standard methods. A modified cloud point titration procedure under constant temperature was used to determine the tie lines and binodal compositions. The phase mixture compositions were determined using gas chromatographic method. Distribution coefficient and selectivity analysis were performed and data accuracy, consistency and reliability were done using a first-order linear polynomial model. The result revealed free fatty acid values for the oil and the biodiesel as 0.63 and 0.23 respectively. The data quality and reliability showed a high coefficient of determination of 0.9998, adjusted coefficient of determination of 0.9887, a standard deviation of 0.0327, and a correlation coefficient of 0.8349 at the investigated temperatures. Methanol was prevalent in the glycerol phase. Ternary phase diagrams provided the visual means of estimating the distribution of the components. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Branched alkanes represent an important class of compounds in conventional fuels and some bio-derived fuels. This study is dedicated to the investigation of the low-temperature oxidation chemistry of 2,6-dimethylheptane using a combination of experimental and computational methods. All the reactants, transition states, and products in the first oxidation stage, which are crucial to the initiation reactions in the low-temperature reaction chain, were optimized through the B3LYP/CBSB7 level of theory and a kinetic mechanism that included the new reaction pathways was assembled. Ignition delay time measurements were carried out in a rapid compression machine and the results were compared with modeling predictions. The kinetic mechanism is able to capture both the first and total ignition delay times with a root-mean-square deviation of 39.6%. In addition, sensitivity analysis is performed to quantify the impact of newly developed chemistry of 2,6-dimethylheptane on ignition delay time. Rate parameters found in this study may be applicable to other branched alkanes with similar molecular structure. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - As two renewable oxygenated biofuels, 2,5-dimethylfuran and 2-methylfuran (DMF and MF) have been considered to be two of the most potential fuels in the future due to the development of the second-generation biosynthetic technologies. The atmosphere pyrolysis experiments with 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% replacement of ethylene by DMF/MF at 1173 and 1273 K were conducted. Collected soot samples were characterized by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to acquire their internal structure and oxidation reactivity. Results showed that soot mass was positively related with DMF addition ratios and the reaction temperature. Soot production was also enhanced when the MF addition ratio gradually increased from 0% to 75%. The influences of DMF addition can promote soot formation more obviously than MF. Temperatures showed a more significant influence on soot morphology than fuel types and DMF/MF addition ratios. For a fixed addition ratio of DMF/MF, soot showed liquid-like substances at 1173 K. At 1273 K, approximately round particles formed and linked together in chains. Moreover, at 1273 K, the aggregates obtained by adding MF contained more single particles, longer carbon chains, and larger projection area compared with the aggregates by adding same MF. For nanostructures, as the addition ratios of DMF/MF increased, as well as the reaction temperature improved, the fringe length of the carbon layer increased, the average fringe tortuosity decreased, and the stacking arrangement of soot became more orderly, the soot oxidation reactivity was lower. Under a same addition ratio and reaction temperature, soot obtained by adding DMF possessed slightly longer fringe length, smaller fringe tortuosity and lower oxidation reactivity than those of the soot obtained by adding MF. High correlation between fringe parameters and soot oxidation reactivity was discovered. The more ordered soot nanostructure, the longer fringe length, and the smaller fringe tortuosity could make the oxidation reactivity of soot get lower. © 2020, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In this paper, we examine the winning bids of the biodiesel auctions conducted by the National Regulatory Agency for Oil, Gas, and Biofuels (ANP) in Brazil from 2012 to 2019. The public policy to develop the Brazilian biodiesel market had on the auction a fundamental pillar, providing stability for both suppliers and demanders. During the study period, the auction design had a stable framework of rules, enabling conditions for understanding competitors' behavior by studying their bids. Initially, we present an overview of the state of the art on the biodiesel program in Brazil and highlight the scarcity of published studies on biodiesel auctions. In sequence, we classify the auction according to the economic theory, showing that it fits the multiunit, sequential, first-price English auction design, and we review the specific literature for this auction model. Then, we analyze the database structure and investigate the presence of information asymmetries among bidders, using cumulative probability comparison as well as the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the t-statistic test for means. Results offer strong evidence in favor of information symmetry. Later, we check the hypothesis of common values on the data, applying a parametric test to verify the presence of the winner's curse. Results corroborate the existence of the winner's curse and the common values paradigm, discarding the application of the independent private-values paradigm to the data. Finally, we comment on the possibility of further studies on the topic. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Second-generation biofuels prove to be a distinctive and renewable source of sustainable energy and cleaner environment. The current study focuses on the exploration and identification of four nonedible sources, that is, Brassica oleracea L., Carthamus oxyacantha M.Bieb., Carthamus tinctorius L., and Beaumontia grandiflora Wall., utilizing light microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for studying the detailed micromorphological features of these seeds. LM revealed that size ranges from 3 to 20 mm. furthermore, a great variety of color is observed from pitch black to greenish gray and yellowish white to off white. Seeds ultrastructure study with the help of SEM revealed a great variety in shape, size, color, sculpturing and periclinal wall shape, and so on. Followed by the production of fatty acid methyl esters from a novel source, that is, seeds oil of Brassica oleracea L. (seed oil content 42.20%, FFA content 0.329 mg KOH/g) using triple metal impregnated montmorillonite clay catalyst (Cu-Mg-Zn-Mmt). Catalyst was characterized using SEM–EDX, FT-IR. Maximum yield of Brassica oleracea L. biodiesel (87%) was obtained at the conditions; 1:9 of oil to methanol ratio, 0.5 g of catalyst, 5 hr reaction time, and 90°C of temperature. Synthesized biodiesel was characterized by FT-IR, GC–MS, and NMR. Fuel properties of the Brassica oleracea L. FAMES were determined and found in accordance with ASTM standards. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - The performance of engine parameters is more influenced with fuel injection strategies namely start of main injection timing (SoMI). An experimental analysis was performed to find the optimum SoMI timing based on performance, emission, and combustion characteristics. Base fuel of diesel and neem biodiesel was used as test fuels. The neem biodiesel was prepared by esterification and transesterification process. It is found from literature that neem biodiesel blend NB20 with diesel gives optimum performance and emission characteristics; therefore, NB20 blend was used for experiments. A variable geometry turbocharger (VGT) compression ignition (CI) engine was used to conduct the experiments. Engine performance parameters were estimated and compared with a base fuel of diesel and with NB20 blends. In this experimentation, fuel injection pressure (FIP) of 800 bar and engine speed of 1700 rpm were considered. SoMI timing was varied from 2° to 10° bTDC with an increment of 2° bTDC timing. Cylinder pressure (CP) and heat release rate (HRR) were estimated and found that are higher for diesel fuel compared to NB20 blend at different SoMI timings. The addition of neem biodiesel NB20 blend to diesel fuel decreases the exhaust emissions except NOx emissions. The BSFC was considerably reduced and BTE was improved almost equivalent to the diesel fuel for NB20. From the results, it is concluded that 10° bTDC SoMI timing provides 13% improvement in BTE, 21% decrement in BSFC, and 7.5% reduction in CO2 emissions. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The exhaust emissions from the compression ignition engines are harmful to both human beings and the environment. After-treatment devices placed in the exhaust are designed to reduce these emissions. These devices have significant conversion efficiency but have various drawbacks such as the cost and availability of the precious catalyst for catalytic converters. In this work, an emission reduction setup was developed that can reduce NO, HC, CO and smoke simultaneously. The emission reduction setup is based on the concept of an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) and plasma generation by corona discharge technique. Both diesel and waste cooking oil biodiesel (WCO) were separately used for the test. The results show that HC emissions at full load with ESP system reduced from 0.71 to 0.27 g/kWh for diesel and for WCO it reduced from 0.81 to 0.31 g/kWh. Similarly, the CO emissions reduced from 1.50 to 0.6 g/kWh for diesel and from 1.95 to 0.92 g/kWh for WCO. The smoke emission and NO emission were also reduced by 30.86 and 29.3% for diesel and WCO and 17 and 18% for diesel and WCO, respectively. However, the carbon dioxide emissions were found to increase as the HC and CO generated were also converted to CO2. The study shows that the emission reduction setup can effectively reduce the emissions without any effect on the engine performance. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The need to develop new, alternative, and bio-origin fuels for use in internal combustion engines has motivated the realization of this research, which aims to characterize the combustion process synthesis gas, represented by H2-CO blends, which are its main constituents. Syngas can be considered a biofuel because it is a mixture of carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and other hydrocarbons, and it is formed by partial combustion of biomass. Experimental tests have been developed in two constant volume combustion bombs with spherical and cylindrical geometries to analyze the combustion process and the influence of the blend composition on the burning velocity. In the first one, the pressure registered during the combustion has been used to obtain the mass burning rate, temperatures, and burning velocities. The cylindrical bomb has two optical accesses through which the combustion process can be visualized and recorded with the Schlieren technique, and it has been used to characterize the morphology of the flame, the evolution of the flame front, or the laminar burning velocities, among other parameters of interest in the combustion process. For initial conditions of 0.1 MPa and 300 K, blends with different compositions and equivalence ratios have been studied. The introduction of hydrogen enhances combustion velocity and pressure, introducing also instabilities visible on flame front images, similar effects to those produced by increasing the equivalence ratio. Regarding the morphology of the flames, note that the tend to wrinkle and the cellularity increases as the hydrogen content of the mixture increases and the equivalence ratio decreases. The dependence of the numerical values of burning velocity has been expressed as a correlation on pressure and temperature. Finally, comparing the results of the burning velocities obtained in the spherical bomb and in the cylindrical bomb with those of different authors of the bibliography has checked the consistency and validity of them. Results of syngas blends are essential for the validation, optimization, and development of kinetic models for combustion development. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - As a typical second-generation diesel biofuel, HRD-76 has received extensive attention. The components of 2, 6, 10-trimethyl dodecane and n-hexadecane were selected and formulated by directly matching functional group information from the nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR)spectroscopy analysis. Then, the chemical reaction mechanism was developed and validated. At last, the simplicity and accuracy were demonstrated by comparing the calculations against experimental data and predictions of other surrogate model for ignition delay times under several initial conditions. The development of surrogate fuel will lay the foundation for deeply understanding the combustion mechanism of HRD-76, and creating an opportunity to study the reaction flow process by simulations. © 2021, Editorial Office of the Journal of Combustion Science and Technology.

AB  - This research work is mainly focused on the extraction of biofuel from Martynia annua seed through a slow pyrolysis process and its utilization as an alternative fuel for the diesel engine. The various properties of biofuel were investigated and the suitability of blending with diesel was also investigated. The pyrolysis process was carried out using a fixed bed batch type reactor unit with an electrical heater after the sample has undergone a pre-treatment process. The pyrolysis process was carried out at 650 °C with a particle size of 250 μm and 3 h of reaction time. The physicochemical properties of pyrolysis oil produced were determined and reported. The produced pyrolysis oil was tested in a diesel engine at different proportions with diesel. From the experimental work, it was found that blend MAPO20 recorded the lowest BSEC at all loads among other blends and diesel. Blend MAPO20 produced the highest BTE of 30.77% which is 2.92% higher than diesel and blend MAPO40 produced BTE at par with diesel. Martynia annua seed pyrolysis oil can replace the petrodiesel up to 40% in an unmodified diesel engine without any major variation in performance and emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, a two-stage liquefaction-hydrogenation approach was devised to produce low-oxygenated bio-fuel from lignocellulose. At the first stage, lignocellulose was liquefied in CO/H2O/EtOH system without catalyst at 250 °C and 12 h to produce bio-crude (BC). Around 55 wt% of bio-crude and approximately 1 wt% lignocellulose solid residue (LSR) could be obtained after liquefaction. It indicated that a low-LSR liquefaction of lignocellulose with acceptably high yield of bio-crude could be achieved under low temperature, as long as long reaction time served. It also suggested that water–gas shift reaction improved BC yield and suppressed LSR formation. At the second stage, the deoxygenation of the bio-crude was then employed in MeOH/CuZnAl-2 system at 330 °C and 6 h with the aid from n-C6H14 and Ni/HZSM-5 to produce the low-oxygenated bio-fuel (LOBF). Notably, without coke formation, the overall yield of the LOBF reached 36.73 wt% with 7.80 wt% of oxygen content, while the HHV of the LOBF reached 40.92 MJ/kg. It was found that MeOH played a role as hydrogen donor for hydrogenation to directly decrease oxygen content and carbon source for alkylation to indirectly decrease oxygen content. Moreover, the n-C6H14 added to methanol contributed to deep deoxygenation of bio-crude, although it had no ability of supplying hydrogen. GC × GC-TOF-MS analysis indicated that the dominant products of the LOBF were hydrocarbons and polymethylphenols. MALDI-TOF-MS analysis showed that there were no big fragments in the LOBF. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The cultivation of oil crops for biofuel production has often been accused of not being environmentally sustainable due to the high inputs needed. To explore the effect of reduced input on pro-ductive and qualitative traits of camelina (Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz), a trial was carried out over a two-year period. This study analysed two different levels of input: a low input treatment (shal-low non-inversion tillage and low fertilisation rate) and a high input treatment (deeper tillage and high fertilisation rate). Camelina was positively, even though to a limited extent, affected by high input treatment as highlighted by the increase in seed yield (from 1.8 to 2.0 t ha–1), crop residues (from 4.8 to 5.2 t ha–1), seed protein content (from 26.5 to 28.9%), seed oil content (from 41.5 to 43.4%) and oil yield (from 0.75 to 0.88 t ha–1). So, from a sustainable point of view, we must consider negligible the effect of high input and satisfactory the performances of camelina in the low input regime. Low input management resulted in satisfactory yields in terms of both quantity and quality, results which were not very different from high input, indicating promising potential for conservation agriculture practices in camelina in a semi-arid envi-ronment. © the Author(s), 2021 Licensee.

AB  - Pyrolysis oil (PO) is an inexpensive biofuel produced via the fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass. However, PO is unstable and has low energy density, making it unsuitable as a fuel in conventional engines without upgrading. Supercritical methanol depolymerization and hydrodeoxygenation were used to convert PO to a mixture of alkanes and alcohols in a continuous packed-bed reaction using the CuMgAlOx catalyst. The PO was pretreated at low temperature to convert acids, aldehydes, and ketones. The pretreated PO was converted continuously for 11 h until the packed bed plugged from coke formation. The catalyst deactivated over time from the deposition of high molecular weight pyrolytic lignin (PL) species. Oxygenates and anhydrosugars in the sugar-rich aqueous fraction of PO were converted to C2-C6 alcohols, esters, and ethers through a mixed hydrodeoxygenation and Guerbet coupling reaction pathway. PL was converted to a mixture of oxygenated aromatics including naphthenes and cyclohexanols. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biobutanol is a renewable, less polluting, and potentially viable alternative fuel to conventional gasoline. Biobutanol can be produced from same sources as bioethanol, and it has many advantages over the widespread bioethanol. This paper systematically analyzes biobutanol fuel as an alternative to bioethanol in alcohol-gasoline mixtures and the physicochemical properties. Based on the conducted analyses, it was found that biobutanol mixtures have a more suitable behavior of vapor pressure without the occurrence of azeotrope, do not form a separate phase in lower temperature, it has higher energy density, but slightly reduce the octane number and a have higher viscosity. However, in general, biobutanol has many advantageous properties that could allow its use in gasoline engines instead of the commonly used bioethanol. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Dimethyl carbonate (DMC) is an interesting blending component for diesel fuel (D) owing to the high oxygen content (53 wt.%) and the absence of C-C bonds in its structure. Moreover, DMC can be produced from CO2 and methanol, which provides a renewable way to reduce anthropogenic CO2. This research has been addressed to assess the use of DMC as a solvent of sunflower oil (SO) and castor oil (CO), with the purpose of obtaining biofuels that can replace fossil diesel as much as possible. The blending of DMC with straight vegetable oils (SVOs) reduces their high viscosity, allowing their usage as drop-in biofuels without chemical treatments. Based on viscosity requirements of European Standard EN 590, the optimal DMC/SVO double blends have been tested as direct biofuels by themselves or mixed with fossil diesel in D/DMC/SVO triple blends. Relevant physico-chemical properties of fuels have been analyzed. Engine parameters such as power output, brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and soot emissions have been studied to determine the effect of new biofuels on efficiency of a diesel engine. An outstanding engine efficiency is shown by the studied D/DMC/SVO triple blends, either with SO or CO as an SVO. The low calorific value of DMC is the main reason for reduction in power and BSFC, as the amount of diesel in the triple blends is reduced. Experimental results demonstrate that the use of these biofuels allows the replacement of up to 40% of fossil diesel, without compromising the power and BSFC of the engine, and accomplishing optimal cold flow properties and a marked drop in exhaust emissions. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the effect of the port injection of ammonia on performance, knock and NOx emission across a range of engine speeds in a gasoline/ethanol dual-fuel engine. An experimentally validated numerical model of a naturally aspirated spark-ignition (SI) engine was developed in AVL BOOST for the purpose of this investigation. The vibe two zone combustion model, which is widely used for the mathematical modeling of spark-ignition engines is employed for the numerical analysis of the combustion process. A significant reduction of ~50% in NOx emissions was observed across the engine speed range. However, the port injection of ammonia imposed some negative impacts on engine equivalent BSFC, CO and HC emissions, increasing these parameters by 3%, 30% and 21%, respectively, at the 10% ammonia injection ratio. Additionally, the minimum octane number of primary fuel required to prevent knock was reduced by up to 3.6% by adding ammonia between 5 and 10%. All in all, the injection of ammonia inside a bio-fueled engine could make it robust and produce less NOx, while having some undesirable effects on BSFC, CO and HC emissions. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Biomass fast pyrolysis is a thermochemical conversion process to produce biofuels. However, the aqueous portion of pyrolysis liquid is usually considered a low-value product. This aqueous liquid can be used as an all-natural food flavoring referred to as liquid smoke in the food industry. This study proposed a small-scale fast pyrolysis process to coproduce liquid smoke, bio-oil, and biochar. The pyrolysis process was designed and simulated based on experimental results. Two production scenarios achieved with a fixed plant or a mobile plant were evaluated in the aspects of economics and environmental impacts. The economical estimation revealed that the fixed plant scenario performed better because of a lower production cost. The sensitivity analysis of the net present value indicated that the liquid smoke price and sale scale were strong impactors. Both scenarios showed a good economic performance in comparison with the biofuel production because of the value-added product, liquid smoke. The environmental impact analysis revealed that a fast pyrolysis was more environmental friendly in comparison with the conventional smoldering process. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Acinetobacter species are gram-negative, non-fermenting bacteria with coccobacilli morphology. The bacteria are found ubiquitously and have the ability to occupy niches which include environmental sites, animals, and humans. The original purpose of this study was to determine if painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) living in the wild in Western Wisconsin were colonized with carbapenem-resistant bacteria. Fecal samples from ten turtles were examined for carbapenem-resistant bacteria. None of the isolates were found to be carbapenem resistant by antimicrobial susceptibility testing. However, all the isolates were resistant to other β-lactams and chloramphenicol classes of antimicrobials. One isolate, Acinetobacter oleivorans strain PT8, was selected for additional characterization, including whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Strain PT8 is capable of degrading biodiesel, forming biofilms, and has a putative type 6 gene cluster. Finally, the taxonomic position of the available whole-genome sequences of 25 A. oleivorans genomes from purified isolates was determined. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.

AB  - A range of energy fuels (ethanol, char, oil/wax and gas) was produced from fibre waste contaminated with plastic through the application of a fermentation-pyrolysis route. The fibre component was first converted to ethanol by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF), achieving an ethanol concentration of 39.8 g/L. The residue, enriched in lignin and plastics, was subjected to fast pyrolysis at temperatures between 350 and 550 °C. A wax product with a higher heating value (HHV) higher than 28 MJ/kg was obtained for temperatures higher than 450 °C, while values lower than 15 MJ/kg were observed for the oils produced from the untreated waste stream. Pyrolysis at 550 °C produced a wax with an HHV as high as 32.1 MJ/kg, where 51.8% of the energy content of the fermentation residue was transferred. The attractive energy contents of the pyrolysis products were enabled by oxygen removal from the feedstock during fermentation to ethanol. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Sewage sludge is a promising biomass alternative for the production of liquid biofuels. In this study, bio-oil derived from the fast pyrolysis of domestic sewage sludge was upgraded in a micro Robinson–Mahoneyreactor at 4 MPa and 260 °C, and in the presence of hybridized Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst and ethanol. Fourier transform infrared and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses were used to identify the functional groups and chemical components of raw and upgraded sewage sludge bio-oil. Results showed that catalytic upgrading reduced the relative content of acids, aldehydes, phenols, ketones, and nitrogenated compounds in the pyrolytic bio-oil. Thus, the main components of the upgraded bio-oil product included esters (48.59%), alkanes (10.12%), aromatics (9.38%), and alkenes (5.08%). Water and nitriles in the raw pyrolytic bio-oil together with in-situ-produced carbon oxides helped in the esterification of raw bio-oil. Reaction mechanisms such as nitrile hydrolysis, hydrogenation, and esterification were proposed to elucidate the conversion of the non-acidic pyrolytic bio-oil into ester-dominating upgraded bio-oil. Overall, upgrading sewage sludge pyrolytic oil is crucial to produce high-quality diesel-range biofuel. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - World biofuel production and trade have grown exponentially in the last decade. Nevertheless, the interaction between the markets for oilseeds (food/feed/bioenergy) and liquid vegetable oil-based biofuels is overwhelmingly complex and thus not well understood. In this study, we developed a spatially explicit agent-based model to provide insights into the effect of farmers' behaviour on trade flows and biodiesel production and to shed light on the influence of import tariffs for both palm oil and biodiesel on system behaviour. This new approach enables us to assess different types of rational economic behaviour for the adoption of crops by farmers. Results show that model outcomes can vary substantially based on the assumptions made concerning the behaviour of farmers. Moreover, we found that biodiesel trade and production are more sensitive to a change in the EU-28's biodiesel import tariff than to a change in the EU-28's palm oil import tariff. Overall, our results show that social processes, actors' heterogeneity, and institutions play an important role in the behaviour of the system. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - We selected a typical developed city in east China, Nanjing, to evaluate the effect of recent national and local policies of air pollution control on emissions and air quality at city scale. Using a bottom-up methodology, the annual emissions of SO2, NOX, CO, NH3, primary fine particle matters (PM2.5), black carbon, and organic carbon were estimated to decline 70%, 22%, 49%, 72%, 64%, 65%, and 86%, respectively, while a slight increase was found for the non-methane volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during 2012–2016. The inter-annual change in NOX emissions was consistent with that in tropospheric NO2 column from satellite observation. Using air quality modeling (AQM), the city-scale emission inventory was further evaluated through comparisons between the simulated and observed concentrations of selected species. For SO2, NO2 and PM2.5, the normalized mean bias (NMB) and normalized mean errors (NMEs) for most cases were within 20% and 50% respectively, implying the reliability of the emission inventory. Regarding chemistry species, the modeling performance was better for sulfate and black carbon than nitrate and ammonium. From 2012 to 2016, the average of monthly PM2.5 concentrations for January, April, July, and October in Nanjing was found to decline 28% and 25% with AQM and ground observation, respectively, implying the benefit of emission control on aerosol pollution. Extra simulations with fixed emissions or meteorology conditions for 2012 and 2016 were conducted to understand the effects of emission control and meteorology variation on the reduced aerosol pollution. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Co-hydroprocessing of straight-run gasoil (SRGO) – rapeseed oil (RSO) mixture over stacked bed sulfide catalytic system (Mo/Al2O3 + NiMo/Al2O3-SAPO-11) was investigated at temperature 350–380 °C, pressure 4.0–7.0 MPa, H2/feed – 1000 Nm3/m3 and liquid hour space velocity 1.0–1.5 h−1. Mo/Al2O3 catalyst was used in the first layer to provide selective conversion of RSO preferably through “direct hydrodeoxygenation” route, excluding COx formation. The influence of temperature and pressure on the product quality and on the conversion of n-octadecane (n-C18H38) produced in hydrodeoxygenation of RSO were studied. The co-processing of 30%RSO/70%SRGO mixture at 350 °C, 5.0 MPa, 1000 Nm3/m3 and 1.5 h−1 gives the product with the acceptable density, sulfur and aromatics contents, but increased cloud point (-1°C). It was shown that a temperature increase from 350 °C to 380 °C resulted in a decrease of cloud point for 12° due to higher n-C18H38 conversion at 380 °C. On the contrary, a pressure increase from 4.0 to 7.0 MPa led to a decrease of n-C18H38 conversion over sulfide Mo/Al2O3 + NiMo/Al2O3-SAPO-11 catalysts. This observation could be explained by higher concentration of NH3 and H2S, by-products of SRGO hydrotreatment, in liquid phase at higher pressure. To prove this hypothesis the effects of NH3 and H2S were investigated on co-processing of 30 wt% RSO in hydrotreated SRGO. It was found that the presence of NH3 was the main reason of inhibiting effect on hydrocracking/ hydroisomerization reactions in co-processing of RSO-SRGO mixtures. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present study, valorization of food and lignocellulosic wastes into biodiesel and 2-phenylethanol using Metchinikowia pulcherrima isolated from rotten food wastes was evaluated. At the optimum pH of 5.5, food waste hydrolysate (FWH) showed 74.1% higher dry weight than the corresponding synthetic medium. Rice straw (RS) and softwood sawdust (WWA) were used as additional carbon sources to increase the C:N ratio of FWH. WWA enhanced the biomass production by 23.3% and 55.9% over the corresponding RS and FWH, respectively; while RS enhanced lipid accumulation. Due to enhancement of growth, 75 g WWA showed the maximum recorded lipid productivity of 2.49 g L−1 d−1. Interestingly, both hexoses and pentoses were effectively metabolized. Regarding fatty acid profile of M. pulcherrima, RS- and WWA-enriched growth media showed higher saturated fatty acids proportions (56.9% and 98.3%, respectively, over that of FWH), with better biodiesel characteristics. FWH showed the heights significant production of 2-phenylethanol up to 56.7 mg L−1 after 96 hours. However, FWH enriched with WWA showed the highest gross energy output of 33.98 GJ m−3 y−1. Thus, the present study suggested an integrated approach of M. pulcherrima cultivation on FWH enriched with WWA for efficient biofuel production through waste recycling. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - This study represented the catalytic pyrolysis of waste cooking oil (WCO) to produce biofuel via continuous reaction by using a pelleted Thai dolomite catalyst. The effect of calcination temperatures on catalyst synthesis was also examined in varying from 600 to 900°C for 2 h. Calcined Thai dolomite (CTD) samples were characterized by X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF), thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential-thermal analysis (DTA), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), N2 adsorption-desorption apparatus, and scanning electron microscope (SEM). In the catalytic pyrolysis process, the CTD catalysts were taken place in a packed bed pyrolysis reactor under atmospheric pressure for biofuel production in different reaction temperatures (450 to 550°C), and WHSV was about 0.5 h-1. The results were found that the effect of calcination temperature significantly altered the physicochemical properties of catalyst as well as the catalytic performance. The specific surface area and pore volume decreased with increasing the calcination temperatures. Besides, CaCO3 was transformed entirely into CaO at 900°C. For the catalytic pyrolysis process, the results were found that the highest pyrolytic yield was obtained at 500°C of reaction temperature using catalyst calcined at 700°C. Additionally, the results also expressed that the calcined temperature was significant in the quality of biofuel products. Moreover, the biofuel products can be separated into biogasoline, biokerosene, and biodiesel. The kinetic viscosity and heating value were satisfied following the standard values except for the acid value of all biofuel products. However, the acid value decreased when the CDT calcined at the highest temperature due to the obvious presenting of the CaO phase. © 2021, Paulus Editora. All rights reserved.

AB  - In a dual-fuel (DF) combustion process, the ignition of the main fuel plays a crucial role on engine performance and emissions. In the present work, a pilot fuel is used to ignite a gaseous methane-air mixture. Three diesel-like pilot fuels are used comparing especially the cetane number (CN) and the aromatic content (AC). The experiments are conducted in a single-cylinder heavy-duty research engine keeping the total-fuel energy constant. Lean conditions are applied for the port-fuel injected methane-air mixture (∅CH4 = 0.52). The methane provides 97% of the total energy while 3% of the energy comes from a pilot fuel. The experiments are performed for two pilot-fuel injection pressures and two engine speeds. The results of the present work suggest that DF combustion consists of three overlapping combustion stages: (I) ignition of the pilot fuel, (II) burning of the main fuel in the vicinity of the pilot fuel, and (III) combustion of the remaining main fuel. It was observed that cetane number directly affects the peak heat-release rate (HRRpeak) during Stage I, whereas aromatic content influences HRRpeak during Stages II and III. A fuel with high cetane number and aromatic content provides high DF combustion efficiency, low methane slip, THC and CO emissions at the expense of high NOx emissions. An increase in the aromatic content is responsible for the increased NOx emissions. Based on the average performance trends of the pilot fuels, they can be rated as [high CN, high AC] &gt; [Low CN, high AC] &gt; [High CN, AC free]. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - In this research, Ni-based catalysts with different supports (HBeta and HZSM-5) were prepared via the impregnation method and subsequently tested for the catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of crude pyrolysis oil (CPO) using supercritical methanol (MeOH). The Ni/HBeta showed a better catalytic performance than Ni/HZSM-5, resulting in a 43.81% deoxygenation degree of CPO. In addition, the ether extraction of CPO was carried out to remove its heavy fraction and improve the efficiency of the upgrading process. A high-quality refined oil was achieved after using the combined physicochemical treatments of ether extraction and supercritical catalytic HDO. The upgrading efficiency was evaluated in terms of the degree of deoxygenation, carbon residue value, water content, higher heating value, and distribution of products. The effect of the type of supercritical solvent on the catalytic HDO performance of Ni/HZSM-5 was evaluated by replacing MeOH with ethanol (EtOH). The results showed that when MeOH was substituted with EtOH, the yields of the gaseous and solid products were significantly reduced, while the yield of liquid products was considerably increased. Meanwhile, the content of coke deposited on the catalysts was analyzed using thermogravimetric analysis, and the coke compositions were evaluated using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. While the minimum catalytic coke content was obtained using Ni/HBeta in the supercritical HDO of CPO, the minimum coke content was observed using Ni/HZSM-5 in the upgrading of ether-extracted pyrolysis oil (EEPO). The FTIR results revealed that the coke deposited on the catalysts was mainly formed through condensation, rearrangement, and hydrogen transfer mechanisms. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The use of fossil fuels represents a large part of the world's energy availability. The burning of these fuels is related to several global problems. They are nonrenewable sources of energy, and therefore, there is a growing demand for new renewable fuels with less environmental impact, such as biofuels. Although there are some problems related to biofuels, such as low oxidation stability and less energy availability, additives can be used to preserve their properties. To this end, a comparative study was carried out between two chalcones that presented good values of calorific power. This study contains structural analysis, theoretical calculations, and energy analysis, in order to understand the structural differences, as well as the supramolecular arrangement and physical-chemical properties. The evaluated results can contribute to the characterization of these chalcones as potential additives and support future studies. © 2021 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - The introduction of biodiesel to the energy production of Brazil occurred mainly because of a legislative incentive that delimits minimum contents of this biofuel to be added to conventional diesel in the whole country. Despite the growth prospects for this sector, there are several difficulties related to the use of biodiesel in combustion engines. Hydroprocessed diesel or green diesel is a viable alternative of renewable biofuel to complement the conventional diesel production; it presents several technical and economic advantages over the biodiesel produced through the transesterification process. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to gather technical information about green diesel, compare it to biodiesel, and analyze the potential of introducing this biofuel to the energy production in Brazil as a substitute or a complementary alternative to conventional diesel. Green diesel stands out technically, mainly when produced from residual raw materials. Considering green diesel production only from fatty waste, it is estimated to serve approximately 55% of the biodiesel demand in Brazil, today produced mostly from crude soybean oil. In addition, the production of this biofuel may occur in existing plants of oil processing through minor adaptations, which ensures reduced installation costs, production, and logistics, especially when considering the current installed capacity in the country. The biggest deadlock related to large-scale production of green diesel in oil refineries in Brazil is the lack of specific legislation that regulates and defines parameters and conditions for the marketing of biofuel. ©

AB  - The development of new bio-based diesel substitutes can improve their compatibility with diesel engines. Nevertheless, for actual implementation, their environmental and economic performance needs to be studied. This study quantified the eco-efficiency of three bio-based diesels, viz., fatty acid methyl ester (FAME), partially hydrogenated FAME (H-FAME), and bio-hydrogenated diesel (BHD), to address the perspective of producers as well as policymakers for implementing the advanced diesel alternatives. The eco-efficiency was assessed as a ratio of life cycle costing as the economic indicator and three different environmental damages—human health, ecosystem quality, and resource availability. The eco-efficiency of FAME was the most favorable among all the potential substitutes with regard to human health and ecosystem quality, but the least favorable for resource availability impact. Even though BHD was beneficial in terms of life cycle costing, it was the least preferable when considering human health and ecosystem quality, though it performed the best for resource availability. H-FAME was also promising, in line with FAME. It is suggested that the technologies for BHD production should be improved, especially the catalyst used, which contributed greatly to environmental impacts and costs. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Micro-reactor (MR) technology is known as an alternative technique for producing materials in a more sustainable way. The advantages of micro-reactors and membrane separation which are combined in membrane micro-reactors (MMR) listed as improved heat and mass transfer, high surface area to volume ratio, enhanced catalytic efficiency with no equilibrium limitation, flexibility in reactor design, a short distance of molecular diffusion as well as high operational safety. The restriction of low production capacity of micro-reactors can be easily solved by using parallel micro-channels in a reactor chip. This mini-review represents firstly the definition of micro-reactors as well as the advantages and disadvantages of membrane micro-reactors. Furthermore, the theoretical basics of membrane micro-reactors and their fabrication methods are presented. At last, the application of catalytic membrane micro-reactors in different processes is given especially in biofuel production. The achieved results of previous researches for hydrogen and other fuels production show better performance of catalytic MMRs in terms of reaction conversion and coke deposition compared with convectional reactors at the same reaction conditions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Biofuels from vegetable oils or animal fats are considered to be more sustainable than petroleum-derived diesel fuel. In this study, we have assessed the effect of hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO) exhaust on levels of DNA damage in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as primary outcome, and oxidative stress and inflammation as mediators of genotoxicity. In a randomized cross-over study, healthy humans were exposed to filtered air, inorganic salt particles, exhausts from combustion of HVO in engines with aftertreatment [i.e. emission with nitrogen oxides and low amounts of particulate matter less than 2.5 µm (approximately 1 µg/m3)], or without aftertreatment (i.e. emission with nitrogen oxides and 93 ± 13 µg/m3 of PM2.5). The subjects were exposed for 3 h and blood samples were collected before, within 1 h after the exposure and 24 h after. None of the exposures caused generation of DNA strand breaks and oxidatively damaged DNA, or affected gene expression of factors related to DNA repair (Ogg1), antioxidant defense (Hmox1) or pro-inflammatory cytokines (Ccl2, Il8 and Tnfa) in PBMCs. The results from this study indicate that short-term HVO exhaust exposure is not associated with genotoxic hazard in humans. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In this study, natural source Parangtritis beach sand was extracted into mesoporous silica (MS). Synthesis of mesoporous silica (MS) was carried out at sodium silicate: CTAB ratio of 1:0.5 (w/w). Monometallic catalyst was used to improve the performance of the catalyst. The monometallic used was Mo metal, which was synthesized using the wet impregnation method. Catalysts were characterized using FTIR, XRD, Surface Area Analyzer (SAA), SEM–EDX, and TEM. MS has pore diameters and surface area of 2.62 nm and 897.3 m2/g, respectively. Mo/MS has pore diameters, surface area, and Mo metal concentration of 2.46 nm, 593 m2/g, and 4.75%, respectively. Catalytic activity and selectivity were evaluated in hydrocracking of waste palm cooking oil at 500, 550, and 600 °C, and catalyst: waste palm cooking oil ratio of 1:100, 1:200, and 1:300. The best catalyst will be tested for reusability 3 times through the hydrocracking process. Mo/MS produces better liquid products and hydrocarbon compounds than MS. The results of the conversion of liquid products analyzed using GCMS. The yield of liquid products obtained in the hydrocracking of waste palm cooking oil using Mo/MS with the optimum temperature and the weight ratio of catalyst: feed at 550 °C and 1: 300 was 66.99 wt.% with consists of hydrocarbon compound as 62.79 wt.%. The yield of liquid products obtained in the hydrocracking waste palm cooking oil using the used Mo/MS catalyst in the last run was 80.26 wt.% with consist of hydrocarbon compound as 74.13 wt.%.

AB  - 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), which can be derived from lignocellulosic biomass, is an important platform molecule that can be used to produce valuable biofuels and polymeric materials. Electrochemical reduction of HMF is of great interest as it uses water as the hydrogen source and achieves desired reduction reactions at room temperature and ambient pressure. Hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis are two important reactions for reductive HMF conversion. Therefore, elucidating key characteristics of electrocatalysts that govern the selectivity for hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis is critical in rationally developing efficient and selective electrocatalysts. In this study, combined experimental and computational investigations are used to demonstrate how the adsorption energy of HMF on metal surfaces and the resulting changes in the intramolecular bond lengths of adsorbed HMF directly impact the reduction pathways of HMF. These results make it possible to rationally understand a general trend in the behaviors observed when using various metal electrodes for HMF reduction. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) can convert methoxyphenols in lignin-derived bio-oil to phenols, a precursor of biofuels. In this work, Mo2C/C catalysts were prepared with lignin-derived biochar as a carbon source for the HDO reaction of guaiacol. The carburization degree of catalyst precursors was tuned by varying the carburization temperature and activation method, thus affecting the activity of the catalyst. Higher carburization temperatures promoted the formation of active Mo2C species at the expense of inactive MoOx and MoSx species. In addition to the high carburization temperature (800 °C), biochar also needed to be activated by H3PO4, HNO3, or a two-step process to obtain Mo2C species. The use of hydrocarbon solvents could reduce the competitive adsorption of the solvent over reactants while inhibiting the side reactions involving solvents, such as alkylation and etherification. Optimized 12.5Mo2C/C-H3PO4 (800) offered a high guaiacol conversion of 98.7% and a phenol yield of 66.8% under the optimum conditions. The yield of methanol was as high as 39.5%, indicating that the demethoxylation reaction was dominant. The catalytic system also exhibited high activity for the HDO of other lignin-derived methoxyphenols to produce phenols. ©

AB  - Binary blends of ethanol-diesel, n-butanol-diesel, ethanol-biodiesel, and n-butanol-biodiesel have been analyzed with terahertz time-domain spectroscopy in a full range of concentrations and at room temperature. The real and imaginary parts of the complex dielectric constant of the blends were obtained from the spectra and fitted to the Debye model at low volume concentrations (up to 7.5% for ethanol in diesel and up to 20% for butanol in diesel, ethanol in biodiesel, and butanol in biodiesel blends), considering the number of relaxation processes recommended in the literature for each pure component (single for diesel, double for biodiesel, and triple for alcohols). The results indicate that the faster relaxation time in low alcohol mixtures is longer than in pure alcohols. This relaxation time increases as the alcohol content increases. The excess of the real and of imaginary parts of the dielectric constant were individually determined. The analysis of such excess and of its different contributions (volume, contrast, and interactions) suggests that the intermolecular interactions between the different components of the blends dominate the relaxation dynamics in each pseudo-binary system. Ethanol was found to move blends further away from ideal behavior than n-butanol. In fact, these latter blends showed the most ideal behavior, suggesting that the length of the alcohol carbon chain plays an important role. This information allows a possible link between the nonlinear behavior of the physicochemical properties of the blends (e.g., viscosity and surface tension) and the molecular interactions between their constituent molecules. This relation could have direct application for monitoring the fuel composition and quality in the vehicle control systems. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The use of biofuels, namely alcohols and biodiesel, leads to lower efficiency and higher nitric oxide (NO) emissions compared with the use of diesel. The objective of this study was to reduce the emissions and enhance the performance from neat coconut oil biodiesel. To begin, the diethyl ether (oxygenated additive, OA) was blended with transesterified coconut oil biodiesel (CBD100). The OA was varied in CBD at 5% and 10% on a volume basis. The results revealed that the addition of the OA to CBD resulted in no phase separation in all working conditions. Further, adding 10% OA to CBD resulted in lower carbon monoxide (1.7%), smoke (2.1%), NO (2.7%), and hydrocarbon (1.9%) emissions than neat CBD. In addition, efficiency increased (1.2%) and fuel consumption lowered (1.3%) by blending the OA with CBD at all loads. © 2021, Canadian Science Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - Microbial lipids with fatty acid compositional profiles similar to vegetable oils are of great potential for the production of biofuels and oleochemicals. However, the costs of microbial lipids remain prohibitively high for broader applications. Microalgae known as the third-generation biomass resources may be explored to reduce the feedstock costs of lipid production. Here, hydrolysates of the microalga Arthrospira platensis were converted into lipids by the oleaginous yeast Cryptococcus curvatus ATCC 20509. Results indicated that hydrothermal pretreatment at 120 °C followed by enzymatic hydrolysis led to recovery of up to 97% total reducing sugar from microalgal biomass. While the as-prepared hydrolysates were ineffective for lipid production due to its nitrogen-rich nature, a high lipid content of 64.5% and a lipid yield of 0.233 g/g were obtained upon phosphate removal with calcium hydroxide. The lipid samples were found similar to palm oils in terms of fatty acid compositional profiles. This work demonstrated that A. platensis biomass can be readily converted into hydrolysates for high-yield lipid production, suggesting an alternative feedstock to cellulosic residues for microbial lipid technology and biorefinery. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The large-scale diversion of crops into mandates-driven biofuels since early 2000s, has raised concerns about impacts of biofuel policies on food prices. This study examines crude oil-corn-livestock dynamic linkages from January 1987 until December 2019 in Ontario, Canada. A significant structural break is identified in March 2011 as biofuel policy impacts become fully implemented and splits the three-decade period into pre- and post-break sub-periods. A nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) approach is employed since it allows prices to be tied by asymmetric relationships both in the short- and long-run. The NARDL model bounds test results indicate that crude oil and corn prices have a long-run connection with livestock prices in both sub-periods. In the post-break period, corn price has an asymmetric effect on cattle price in the long-run, with negative shocks in the corn price leading to a greater intensity on the cattle price than positive shocks. The presence of short-run asymmetry is evident in the impacts of crude oil price on both cattle and hog prices. However, the above asymmetric effect is insignificant in the pre-break period. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Based on Brazilian isolated communities’ situation about absence energy distribution, mainly in the Amazon, northeastern semi-arid and isolated regions of the Savana, some alternatives should be developed to produce electric power for energy supply. Looking for the capacities and sources of these communities, the oilseed production capacity is the most promised. So, a easy to handle pilot plant for cracking oils and fats was developed to produce biofuels. This study aimed to analyse the mass and energy balances of the pilot plant to check its viability for sustainable energy supply. For this, three different cracking temperatures (663 K, 678 K and 693 K) were studied, and reaction data was collected. The physicochemical properties are similar to those of petroleum diesel, indicating that thermal cracking fuel may be a viable alternative to this fossil fuel in diesel cycle engines. The best temperature for the cracking reaction was 678 K, due to the physicochemical parameters of the biofuel produced being similar to those of fossil diesel. So, according to energy production system, the cracking temperatures 678 and 693 K are recommended. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The need for sustainable wastewater treatment and search for cheap feedstock for renewable energy production have driven investigators to evaluate the potential of producing biofuels from waste materials such as sewage sludge. The current work is aimed at assessing the potential for producing hydrocarbons from the lipid fraction of activated sludge via a catalytic hydrothermal decarboxylation reaction under varying residence time. Impacts of platinum on carbon (Pt/C) and palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalysts were evaluated at 290 °C and residence time of 0.5, 1, 3 and 4 h. The analyses of the lipids and hydrocarbons were done using high-temperature gas chromatography. The results show that at the optimum conditions of 1 h, 290 °C, 20 mg of catalyst, 100 mg of lipid extract and 15 mL of water, the maximum yield of hydrocarbon was 23.2% of pentadecane obtained using Pt/C. This shows that the dominant hydrocarbon is pentadecane and that Pt/C exhibited greater catalytic effect than did Pd/C. The hydrocarbons might be used directly as renewable diesel and as such will contribute to the mitigation of climate change since emission of greenhouse gases will be reduced, and the use of activated sludge as the feedstock is expected to help minimize the cost of production and to ensure sustainable wastewater treatment. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Due to environmental concerns and cost issues, coal is currently being phased out from usage in electricity production. Regardless, there remains a massive stockpile of coal reserves along with a large industrial complex and a robust distribution/processing infrastructure. As such, coal should be considered for usage in other energy areas. Since coal is simply a solid hydrocarbon, it can be converted over for usage as a transportation fuel. The Fischer-Tropsch process that underlies this conversion is well established with some countries like South Africa currently using it at large scales. Unfortunately, this conversion process has a large carbon footprint, even when using carbon capture technology. However, the blending of coal-based fuels with biodiesel has been found to be more carbon neutral than standard diesel or biodiesel alone. Additionally, coal can be used as an alternate to methane for hydrogen production. Given carbon capture technologies and the existing coal infrastructure, these two uses of coal provide opportunities for a sustainable and economical use of coal as a transportation fuel. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - The use of produced water becomes an option in the irrigation of non-food crops with potential for biofuel production. However, its effects on different stages of plant development and mainly on seed germination should be known. The study was conducted to evaluate the performance of sunflower seedlings subjected to different types of produced water. An experimental design in a factorial scheme was adopted to evaluate 3 cultivars (Catissol 01, Embrapa 122 and IAC Iaramã) and 6 types of water (distilled water-control, public-supply water, water resulting from the water and oil separation process-WOS, filtration in sand filter-SAF, filtration in sand + charcoal filter-SCF, and filtration in sand + osmosis filter-SOF). In addition, the substrate was moistened with polyethylene glycol (PEG) solutions, simulating the osmotic potentials of the evaluated waters, and a sensitivity test was conducted with lettuce seeds under conditions similar to those adopted for sunflower. The cv. Catissol showed higher percentages of germination and vigor of seedlings, regardless of the water used. There was a trend of reduction in germination and vigor of seedlings with the use of produced water treated with the WOS, SAF and SCF systems. All water potentials simulated by PEG solutions reduced the germination and vigor of lettuce seeds, and the effect was more pronounced for the WOS system. SOF was the only one capable of making the produced water non-toxic to sunflower seeds and lettuce seedlings. © 2021, Federal University of Lavras. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present paper aims to show the difference between fresh feed oil and waste cooking oil and their effect on Engine performance, Exhaust gases, and Combustion Engine. This study has used waste cooking oil (sheep tallow) (WCO) as well as a new species of algae (Mastocarpus papillatus). The results indicate that the torque, power, brake specific consumption, Exhaust gas temperature, and NOx emission of fresh feed give much closer results to diesel fuel, and their difference for 5% biofuel with WCO is around 2–3%, 2–6%, 6–7%, 1–3%, and 2–9%. The CO, soot, and HC emission of fresh feed nave much better results to diesel fuel, and their difference for 20% biofuel with WCO is around 5–25%, 6–12%, and 11–19%. Compared to waste oil, the peak pressure for fresh feed was lower; therefore, being compared to waste fuel, the fresh feed shows better results for emission and performance in the engine. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Introduction of biofuels to the fuel matrix poses new questions and challenges. This study presents the behavior of microbial growth on physicochemical properties in different kinds of biodiesel/diesel mixtures that are produced from raw materials. A variety of fatty acid methyl ester samples were produced from raw materials such as sunflower oil, soybean oil, pomace oil, castor oil, palm oil and used frying oil. After these samples were produced they were mixed with conventional automotive diesel at concentrations of 10 and 20% v/v in respect with biodiesel. Also similar blends were prepared with the above produced methyl esters differentiating in which the antioxidant TBHQ had been added previously in concentration 0.1%. The outcomes indicated that in mixtures of methyl esters with an augmented content of saturated fatty acids such as palm methyl esters and monounsaturated fatty acids (i.e. pomace methyl esters) there was appearance of microbial growth in the fuel phase shown more quickly while the mixtures with TBHQ showed reduction in microbial load. Furthermore, in samples with a large augmentation in the number of acidity, the microbial load detected was negligible or zero. Samples with a zero or decreased microbial activity indicated lower pH values in the water phase. © 2021, Associação Brasileira de Engenharia Química.

AB  - Developing an effective cleaner process technology for maize-cob biomass wastes is of utmost importance. This work involved the comparison of products yield (bio-oil, biogas, and biochar) from the fast, slow, and flash pyrolysis of maize-cob biomass wastes using a fixed-bed reactor; evaluation of the individual and combined influences of pyrolysis temperature, biomass particle size, and residence time on the yield of product, and the determination of the optimum pyrolysis conditions/products yield of fast pyrolyzed maize-cob. The fast pyrolysis was performed according to the Box-Behnken Design of Experiment with three variables and three levels of the response surface methodology. The bio-oil fuel properties were determined utilizing ASTM methods and chemically characterized using CHNS elemental analyzer, GC/MS, and FTIR. The performance of the three pyrolysis techniques in terms of their product yield is in the following order: Flash pyrolysis > Fast pyrolysis > Slow pyrolysis (for bio-oil); Slow pyrolysis > Fast pyrolysis > Flash pyrolysis (for biochar and biogas). An optimum bio-oil yield of 43.13% with a high heating value (HHV) of 30.59 MJ/kg, biochar yield of 37.18% with HHV of 20.41 MJ/kg, and biogas yield of 26.05% (HHV = 13.19 MJ/kg) was respectively obtained at an optimum temperature of 567.72, 463.71, and 593.17 °C; biomass particle size of 0.51, 3.83, and 2.58 mm; and residence time of 10.01, 15.28, and 18.92 min. The determined physicochemical characterized properties of the maize-cob-derived-bio-oil revealed that the bio-oil can potentially be valued as a biofuel and as a more promising feedstock for value-added chemical production. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Processed oil (HTO) is paraffin-based biofuels derived from many edibles and non-edible sources. HTVO shall be employed in engines as blended fuel with diesel or as neat fuel without or with any major modifications. However, the production of edible resources competes with food production. Hence, alternative non-edible and waste oil will be in high demand over the upcoming years to felicitate the significant replacement of fossil fuels. In this study, catalytic processing of non-edible and waste seed oil derived from custard seeds (HTCSO) was employed to produce fuels as a substitute for the transesterification process. The application of processed treatment will significantly increase in the transport sector in the coming years. This study investigates the extensive study on HTCSO on engine performance and emission patterns of a 4-stroke (Kirloskar AV1), 5.5 kW diesel engine. Ignition patterns were computed at different conditions by altering HTCSO percentage (25 and 50% volume) compared with diesel. Twenty-five and 50% volume of HTCSO blended with 75 and 50% of petrodiesel is referred to as HTCSO25D75 and HTCSO50D50, respectively. HTCSO/diesel blends show that the thermal brake efficiency (BTE), in general, was found to be increased, and brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) decreased with increased volume fraction of HTCSO in the blends. NOx CO, HC, and smoke opacity were found lower for all HTCSO blends than diesel at all load conditions. It shall be decided from the experimental research that HTCSO is a potential alternative to diesel fuel. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The rapid diminish of petroleum resources, escalating environmental pollutants, and ever-growing petroleum prices have emerged as a unique focal point on renewable sources like biofuel. The transesterification method was used to acquire soybean methyl ester (SME) from extracted soybean oil. Then, the biodiesel blends on volume bases such as B10 (10% SME with 90% neat diesel), B20 (20% SME with 80% neat diesel), and B30 (30% SME with 70% neat diesel) were prepared. Primarily, experimentation with neat diesel and biodiesel blends on Kirloskar made diesel engines with a standard CR 18. It is found that B20 is shown lower emissions such as HC, CO, and relatively higher brake thermal efficiency (BTE) than the other samples. Further, retarded and advanced the compression ratios (CR) as 17 and 19, respectively. Based on the obtained results observed, the 7.11% enhanced BTE for B20 at CR19 to the neat diesel. B20 at CR19 exhibits the diminution emissions such as CO and HC about 6% and 21% than the B20 at standard CR. At B20 with CR19 showed a drastic reduction in smoke opacity, which is around 38.8% lesser than the diesel fuel operation. The overall observation recommends blend B20 at CR19 to attain the hopeful outcome from compression ignition engines. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - This study investigated experimentally pyrolysis of rubberwood sawdust (RWS), sewage sludge (SS), and their blends (25:75, 50:50, and 75:25 by weight) in an agitated bed pyrolysis reactor. The yields and characteristics of liquid product and biochar were determined for pyrolysis at 450, 500, and 550 °C and were affected both by temperature and feedstock type. The liquid and biochar yields were in the ranges 27.30–52.42 and 21.43–49.66 (wt%). Pyrolysis of RWS at 550 °C provided the highest liquid yield, while SS gave a high biochar yield. Co-pyrolysis of SS with RWS improved yield and quality of liquid and biochar products. The liquid product had 57.54–70.70 wt% of water and a low hydrocarbon content. The higher heating value (HHV) of water-free liquid product was 14.73–22.45 MJ/kg. The major compounds of liquid product included acetic acid, 2-propanone, 1-hydroxy, and phenols according to GC-MS. The biochar from RWS had a high carbon content (83.37 wt%) and a high HHV (33.57 MJ/kg), while SS biochar was mainly ash (67.62 wt%) with low carbon content. The SS biochar also had high contents of Si, Ca, Fe, K, and Mg as determined by XRF. Co-pyrolysis of SS with RWS improved the biochar by increasing its carbon content and reducing ash and inorganic elements. The surface of RWS biochar was more porous, while SS biochar had the larger specific surface according to SEM and BET. Based on these results, co-pyrolysis of 75:25 feedstock mix is recommended for further studies on applications of liquid product and biochar. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Dual fueling is a successful model in the engine combustion area which perks up the performance and emission fronts. The combined effect of using biodiesel and gas dual fueling shall address the problem associated with emissions and depletion of fossil fuels. Fuel derived from Annona squamosa seeds is a creditable biofuel, which is resulted from waste seeds. This paper characterizes the gaseous exhaust emission and performance model of a dual-fueled, direct injection diesel engine fueled with ethane as gaseous fuel and Annona squamosa biodiesel as the base and liquid fuel. Ethane is supplied with air in the intake manifold at different flow rates (five lpm and ten lpm). Ethane supply at ten lpm lowered HC emissions by seven ppm, CO by 0.4% and smoke emission by 0.2 BSU for biodiesel. In addition, ethane supply to biodiesel lowered the BSFC by 13 kg/kW-h and enhanced the efficiency by 0.4%. Hence, dual-fueling ethane is an effective technique for improving the usage of biofuels in diesel engine applications. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Disposal of biomass waste in winery industry is an additional burden to the breweries. This biomass when converted to useful source of fuel energy to compression ignition engines serves the dual effect of waste reduction as well as cheaper energy source. Grapeseed biodiesel has been rarely studied in the recent literatures. The aim of this research is to analyze the effects of grapeseed (GS) biodiesel and higher order alcohol on the combustion and emission parameters of a diesel engine. Alcoholic blends such as butanol and octanol at 20% by volume were added to 80% of GS biodiesel and engine tests were conducted. NOx emissions were higher for GS_B20 blend. Later tests were conducted to understand and analyze the combined effect of varying EGR rates (10%, 20%, and 30%) and injection timing (21°bTDC, 23 °bTDC, and 25°bTDC) on engine parameters for GS_B20 blend at all load conditions. GS_B20 injected at 21° bTDC (retarded) and 30% EGR presents the least cylinder pressure and HRR of 63.8 J/°CA and 53.75 J/°CA. Biomass waste converted GS biodiesel with 20% butanol could be considered as a suitable fuel for diesel engine with few engine modifications. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - n-Butanol is used in a wide range of applications and recently, the use of n-butanol as a fuel, which can be employed pure or blended with gasoline or diesel, has been proposed. So, in an attempt to deepen in the one-step catalytic process to produce n-butanol from ethanol, bifunctional catalysts in different chemical/spatial environment as MgAl- and CaFeMg-multioxide catalysts were developed, prepared and characterized. Both mixed oxides were obtained by thermal decomposition of the synthesized hydrotalcites considering the partial substitution of Mg2+ and Al3+ by Ca2+ and Fe3+, namely MgAl-Ox and Ca20Fe20MgAl-Ox. The nature of acid and basic properties of the samples were analyzed employing NH3 and CO2 as probe molecules, and TPD analysis were performed to quantify the relative contribution of acidic/basic sites. Ca20Fe20MgAl-Ox sample presented an improved basicity with minimal acidity reduction. The performances of the activated catalysts were measured in a fixed-bed reactor under transient and continuous operation modes by DRIFT-MS studies and under transient pulse experiments. It was verified that both catalysts, but specially Ca20Fe20MgAl-Ox, promote the synthesis of C4-compounds from ethanol due to the modulated acid and basic sites capable of modify the ethanol adsorption in the form of ethoxy-species and a combined higher basicity with centers to catalyze the hydrogenation using the ethanol as the hydrogen donor. Ca20Fe20MgAl-Ox reached ethanol conversion values of 36% at 280 °C and 71% at 400 °C with a higher selectivity to n-butanol and other C4-compounds. Two parallel routes at differentiated temperatures: direct acetaldehyde self-condensation and the intermediary crotyl alcohol transfer hydrogenation, were evidenced and prevailing in n-butanol formation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Rice straw is an important feedstock for second-generation biorefineries, the majority being conventional white rice. This research investigated the potential of the straw of black rice Chakhao Poireiton, a rice variety of increasing importance, for biorefining. Pre-treatment of black rice straw was carried out in a pressurised microwave reactor and free sugar release was measured following digestion with Cellic® CTec3. This was compared to white rice straw. Pre-treatment (100 − 200° C for 5 min) did not drastically impact the sugar composition but brought about an enhanced release of glucose after enzymatic hydrolysis from 25 to 50% (black rice) and from 26 to 55% (white rice). For xylose digestibility, the increase was around seven-fold for black rice (8 to 57%) and five-fold for white rice (13 to 64%). This improvement in digestibility of the straw samples could have come from modification in the lignocellulose structural features making the polysaccharides more susceptible to hydrolysis. Black rice could be a suitable feedstock for a combined biorefinery–food and nutraceuticals from grain (much higher than white rice) and the straw for fermentable sugars comparable to white rice straw for biofuels. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Although Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) is one of the promising renewable energy technologies, several technical and economic challenges should be addressed. One of the major issues associated with Concentrated Solar Power technologies is the reliability limitation of the plant in the stand-alone configuration. Therefore, Concentrated Solar Power systems can be integrated with either thermal energy storage (TES) or a fossil-fuelled power assist FFPA). However, initial and maintenance costs and emission production are the main challenges for the developing countries. Integrating biofuel/biogas with CSP increases the renewability while solar irradiation is in absent. The paper main objective is to perform a feasibility study of integrating a biofuel based gas turbine power units in a Concentrated Solar Power plant for electricity and water cogeneration. The study includes the thermodynamics analysis and assessment of three biofuels, namely, Jatropha oil, castor oil, and palm oil. In addition, a cost lifecycle, sensitivity, and Monte Carlo analyses were performed. The results showed that Castor oil had a better performance in terms of efficiency and carbon dioxide emissions with a maximum daily freshwater production of 181,000 m3/day. The proposed integration resulted in a levelized cost of water that is lower than the water tariff in the UAE by $1.39/m3 with a payback period of 5 years. © 2021, International Centre for Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems SDEWES.

AB  - This study is aimed at synthesizing amyl alcohol from Scenedesmus quadricauda third-generation microalgae biomass which is cultivated sustainably using reactor combinations and Ehrlich biosynthetic pathway. Systematic experimentation was carried out on a compression ignition engine at maximum throttle pedal position condition to assess the potential of amyl alcohol-diesel mixture combinations and to assess its environmental impact at different loads. Optimum mixture proportion of amyl alcohol-diesel blends were identified statistically using multivariate principal component and desirability analysis based on the experimental data acquired from the engine testbed. From the study, it was inferred that a dry biomass yield rate of 4.2 g/L was achieved when the light intensity was maintained at ~51-56 μmol/m2/s in the in-situ raceway pond while cultivating Scenedesmus quadricauda. Experimentation showed that the fuel consumption reduced by 72.4% for AA20D80 at low-high load conditions. Improved combustion characteristics are achieved at higher concentrations of amyl alcohol operating at medium-high loads. The lowest smoke and NOX emission of 52.85 mg/m3 and 104 ppm was observed for AA40D60 at no-load condition. Statistical analysis revealed that the optimal amyl alcohol-diesel mixture combinations to be AA20D80 with combined desirability of 0.497. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - An alternative methodology was developed to monitor the biokerosene content of palm kernel in blend with kerosene using medium infrared spectroscopy associated with partial least squares (PLS). The efficiency of this methodology was analyzed based on the parameters of accuracy and figures of merit. The values of root-mean-square error of cross-validation (RMSECV), root-mean-square error of calibration (RMSEC) and root-mean-square error of prediction (RMSEP) were in agreement because the RMSEP was higher than RMSECV and RMSEC. In addition, the RMSEP value is considered acceptable according to the Brazilian standard ABNT NBR 15568 because it is less than 1%. The figures of merit were performed in agreement with the requirements established in the standard ASTM E1655-05. The linearity of the model was assessed based on the analysis of the model fit through the correlation of the actual and predicted values of the calibration and prediction sets, where a high correlation between the values was evidenced, with a correlation coefficient (R) exceeding 0.99. The good results of the application of MIR spectroscopy combined with multivariate regression by PLS suggest that this analytical methodology is feasible, efficient and suitable for use by inspection agencies to control the biokerosene content of palm kernel in mixture with diesel. © 2021 DKK Comunicacao.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biofuels are the most promising sustainable fuels for supplementing shrinking fossil resources. In this work, acid-modified vermiculite (AVM)-supported Pd–Ni bimetallic catalyst (Pd–Ni/AVM) was investigated for the hydrodeoxygenation of bio-oil and its model compounds to assess its reactivity. Pd–Ni/AVM was found to efficiently hydrodeoxygenate the investigated model compound (phenol). The phenol conversion reached 94% at 0.5% of Ni loading and temperatures beyond 513 K. Using these parameters, the phenolic hydroxyl group was removed, and the C = C bonds were saturated. This catalyst was also efficient in the hydrodeoxygenation of bio-oil. H2-TPR experiments elucidated the synergistic effects between the active component and the carrier, which were considered the main reason for the catalytic activity. Strong influences of the Ni loading and temperature on the hydrogenation of phenol were also observed when the Pd loading was fixed at 1 wt%.

AB  - Abstract: WOx-promoted TiO2–ZrO2 solid acid catalyst was prepared and applied in the catalytic acetalization and ketalization of glycerol with carbonyl compounds to produce biofuel additives. The presence of WOx promoter and TiO2 remarkably improved the catalytic activity of ZrO2. Approximately, 100% glycerol conversion was evidenced with non-bulky aliphatic aldehydes and ketones like, propanol and cyclohexanone. The physical characterization of WOx-promoted TiO2–ZrO2, revealed a higher formation of tetragonal crystalline phase of ZrO2, over monoclinic. The total surface acidity and the ratio of Brønsted to Lewis acidic site concentrations were determined by NH3-TPD and pyridine-chemisorbed FTIR spectroscopy, respectively. A considerably higher concentration of Lewis acidic sites, ~ 213.29 μmol/gm, was evidenced on the WOx-promoted TiO2–ZrO2 catalyst surface. Catalytic activity study revealed a direct correlation between the surface Lewis acidic site concentration and the activity of catalyst. This significant observation indicated the key role of Lewis acidic sites in this catalytic process. The WOx-promoted TiO2–ZrO2 catalyst was also considerably stable and showed good performance in the acetalization/ketalization of glycerol with other substituted carbonyl compounds. Graphic Abstract: The WOx-promoted TiO2–ZrO2 solid acid catalyst exhibits superior catalytic performance for acetalization and ketalization of glycerol with carbonyl compounds to produce biofuel additives.

AB  - These days, biomass-based low viscous renewable biofuel is very much popular for internal combustion engine applications due to its unique features compared to other form of biofuels. In this present work, a comparative analysis has been carried out to investigate the suitability of waste biomass-based low viscous biofuel through long-term durability study. A 256 h of long-term endurance test as per Indian Standard: 10,000, Part IX-1980 standard has been conducted using 10% and 20% by volume of waste biomass-based biofuel in two different phases, and the tested results are compared with the results of conventional diesel fuel. During this long-term endurance study, the variations in performance, emissions and behaviours are observed before and after the 256 h of operation in both the phases. The long-term endurance test has degraded the engine components which has reflected in engine performance. The carbon deposit would play a vital role in lowering the engine performance. It has been evident that lubricant oil degradation is deteriorates the engine performance. Furthermore, the durability study has also reflected that the diesel engine emissions are extremely higher after the endurance test when compared to fresh engine. On the other hand, the carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbon emissions are lower in waste biomass-based biofuel operation except oxides of nitrogen emissions. This is due to the clean burning ability of biofuel which has shown remarkable combustion behaviour compared to diesel fuel. The long-term tribological test has shown that the kinematic viscosity and flash point of lubricating oil are reduced during endurance study and this has reflected more severe for diesel fuel when compared to waste biomass-based biofuel. The ash content for 20% of lemon peel oil is 19% higher than diesel fuel and 10% of lemon peel oil blend. Higher rate of oxidation has resulted in significant reduction in total base number of lubricating oil which reveals that the low viscous biofuel has higher lube oil degradation. It is also evident that wear of engine components is deteriorated the life of the engine along with lubricant oil degradation. Piston rings wear is more in the lubricant collected from 20% of lemon peel oil blend as compared other fuels. Finally, it has been concluded that the low viscous biofuel has poor resistance on diesel engine wear and this could be rectified before its application.

AB  - The European (and global) energy sector is in a process of profound transformation, making it essential for changes to take place that influence energy producers, operators, and regulators, as well as consumers themselves, as they are the ones who interact in the energy market. The RED II Directive changes the paradigm of the use of biomass in the heat and electricity sectors, by introducing sustainability criteria with mandatory minimum greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions and by establishing energy efficiency criteria. For the transport sector, the extension of the introduction of renewables to all forms of transport (aviation, maritime, rail and road short and long distance), between 2021-2030, the strengthening of energy efficiency and the strong need to reduce GHG emissions, are central to achieving the national targets for renewables in transport, representing the main structural changes in the European decarbonisation policy in that sector. It is necessary to add that biomass is potentially the only source of renewable energy that makes it possible to obtain negative GHG emission values, considering the entire life cycle including CO2 capture and storage. Hence, this work aims to analyse the relevance of biomass for CHP and in particular, the use of biomass for biofuels that contribute to achieving carbon neutrality in 2050. The following thematic sub-areas are addressed in this work: i) the new environmental criteria for the use of biomass for electricity in the EU in light of now renewable energy directive; ii) current and emerging biofuel production technologies and their respective decarbonization potential; iii) the relevance or not of the development of new infrastructures for distribution renewable fuels, alternatives to the existing ones (biomethane, hydrogen, ethanol); iv) the identification of the necessary measures for biomass in the period 2020-2030. © 2021 RIC Pro-Akademia – CC BY.

AB  - In this study, the physicochemical properties of linseed and linseed biofuel were studied and their effect on the flow properties of Nigerian waxy crude oil at different volume fractions was investigated. The Nigerian wax crude oil was characterized for its specific gravity, API gravity, wax content, pour point and cloud point. The properties of the linseed oil and linseed biodiesel investigated include: density, specific gravity, viscosity, pour point, cloud point and flash point. Upon esterification of the free fatty acid (FFA) contained in the linseed oil reduced from 3.5 to 0.75 and the viscosity of the seed oil reduces from 2169 to 362 mm2/s. The linseed oil and its biodiesel exhibited similar trend of reduced viscosity at higher shear rate, however, linseed biodiesel demonstrated the lowest viscosities, cloud points and pour points owing to reduced fatty contents. The effect of the linseed oil and its biodiesel on the pour point and cloud point of the waxy crude oil was determined; and the performance compared to that of xylene. A rapid drop in the pour point and cloud point was observed with the wax crude pre-heated with 0.1 v/v linseed oil, its biodiesel and xylene. © 2021 Chinese Petroleum Society

AB  - As a hard-to-decarbonize sector, the shipping industry is experiencing demands to accelerate the transition from fossil fuels to alternative low-carbon fuels, to significantly reduce the negative impacts on the environment. Biofuels are regarded as one of the solutions for decarbonization in the marine sector. This paper introduces a lignin-derived drop-in biofuel, 2-methoxy-4-propylphenol (2M4PP), from non-edible feedstocks and investigates engine performance using its 10% (by volume) blend with standard diesel fuel (DF) at variable engine speeds and loads. Results show insignificant difference between the in-cylinder pressures of the proposed blend and DF. The diesel-2M4PP blend emits less carbon monoxide (CO) and nitric oxide (NOx) than DF at all speeds by up to 39.6% and 10.7% respectively, although its brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) is higher. A Ricardo wave model, which is validated with engine experimental data at 2400 rpm speed and full load, is investigated by adjusting injection pressure, injection timing, injection duration and nozzle diameter. The optimal parameters, i.e., 214 bar injection pressure, 6° injection timing, 41.4° injection duration, and 0.37 mm injector orifice, lead to the best engine performance with improved brake power, reduced NOx emissions, and limited influence on BSFC and hydrocarbon emissions compared to DF. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - The production of biodiesel has increased globally during the last decade to overcome the problems of increasing prices of petro-diesel and the depletion of fossil fuels. The present study aimed to utilize agro-waste sugarcane bagasse (SCB) to synthesize a heterogeneous acid catalyst for biodiesel production using waste cooking oil. Waste sugarcane bagasse was converted into biochar through partial carbonization and activated via sulfonation by using acid solutions of different concentration i.e., 1M, 3M, 5M and concentrated sulfuric acid at a sulfonation temperature of 180 °C for 5 h. The prepared catalysts were characterized by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) technique, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen and Sulfur (CHNS) analyzer. The prepared catalyst exhibited an excellent surface area of 20.78 m2 g–1 and a total acid density of 3.94 mmol g–1. The biodiesel production process was optimized by varying reaction temperature from (40–70 °C), methanol to oil molar ratio (5:1–20:1), catalyst loading (1–7 wt.%) and reaction time (5–25 min) by using a microwave reactor. The maximum conversion of 95.45% and yield of 92.12% was obtained under optimum conditions: catalyst loading 5 wt%, methanol-to-oil molar ratio (15:1), temperature (60 °C) after 15 min. The results of the experiments were validated by using response surface methodology, which validated the predicted model. The kinetic study of experiments showed that the use of sulfonated catalysts lowered the activation energy (10.5 kJ mol–1) and reactants attained an equilibrium point after a short interval under microwave heating. Reusability of catalyst up to seven cycles with 77.34% yield of biodiesel using low-grade feedstock showed that the catalyst is stable and can be used for sustainable biodiesel production. The utilization of wastes for catalyst synthesis and for biodiesel production can help to minimize the overall production cost of biodiesel. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - The use of residual biomass streams for production of liquid fuels will help in achieving the goal of renewable transportation fuels and sustainable society. Hence, efficient, and reliable processes offering a flexible product distribution proven at commercial scale are required. This study explores the technical feasibility of producing gasoline and diesel range hydrocarbons from thermochemical processing of biomass via the production of light olefins (C2-C4) and their subsequent oligomerization through mathematical modelling and simulation using MATLAB software. Different biomass processing scenarios were considered, including a standalone biomass gasification plant and integrated biomass pyrolysis- char gasification (O2- or air-blown) process. Process analysis indicated that the integrated plant offers 10-11% higher carbon efficiency. The processing step with the highest carbon penalty for all the cases is the syngas composition tailoring via water-gas shift reaction. Copyright © 2021, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - CO2-neutral fuels are a way to cleaner and more sustainable mobility. Utilization of bio-syngas via Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis represents an interesting route for the production of tailormade biofuels. Recent developments in FT catalyst research led to olefin-enriched products, enabling the synthesis of alcohol-enriched fuels by reductive hydroformylation of the C=C bond. Several alcohols have already proven to be suitable fuel additives with favorable combustion behavior. Here, a hydroformylation-hydrogenation sequence of FT-olefin-paraffin mixtures was investigated as a potential route to alcohols. A liquid-liquid biphasic system with a rhodium/3,3’,3’’-phosphanetriyltris(benzenesulfonic acid) trisodium salt (TPPTS) catalyst system was chosen for effective catalyst recycling. After optimizing reaction conditions with a model substrate consisting of 1-octene and n-heptane the conversion of an actual olefin-containing C5-C10 FT product fraction to alcohols in continuously operated processes for 37 h was achieved with a total turnover number of 23679. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - The use of residual oils as raw materials to produce fatty esters in the biodiesel industry is of great interest, as it may improve both the economic and environmental aspects of a process. The use of these residual materials in biofuel production can aggregate value to something that would otherwise be solely disposed of and, as they have lower costs related to the refined oil, its use could reduce operating costs in the industry. However, these resources usually present high free fatty acid (FFA) content. Therefore, considering the traditional biodiesel production process, these fatty acids must be removed before entering the transesterification reactor due to soap formation, which reduces the reaction yield. As a result, to remove these FFA, one of the most common procedures is through the inclusion of a previous step, the esterification reaction. In both esterification and transesterification, short-chain alcohols are generally used to promote FFA and triglycerides conversion into long-chain esters. Concerning the influence associated with the choice of different alcohols, there is a wide variety of process analyses presented in the literature focusing on using only one type of alcohol, usually methanol or ethanol, in both reactions. Nevertheless, the study of a biodiesel production process evaluating the possibility of using the two alcohols at distinct parts in the process is a significant gap to be filled. In this study, an in-depth analysis of the esterification and transesterification reaction kinetics using methanol and ethanol was carried out as a possible optimization variable. In addition, the process simulation concerning the use of different alcohols for each reaction was performed. Several conditions were tested in both reactors before the final alcohol selection, and the use of methanol in the esterification and ethanol in the transesterification reaction presented the most promising results, indicating that a hybrid process concerning alcohol use may bring significant advantages to the process. To validate this theory, a complete process and economic analysis were carried out, evaluating not only the results obtained from the reaction but also the purification steps. Another essential aspect considered in the project is the fatty acid content in the oil, which may vary according to storage conditions and prior use. Thus, the impact due to this fluctuation in the economic aspects was verified. With the simulated base project, different optimizations were made to reduce the entire process's equipment and operational costs. An energy analysis was also developed with the inclusion of energy-saving heat exchangers, which reduced utility costs. Finally, an economic evaluation of the final process was obtained to assess the main variables affecting the project and its payback time. It is essential to say that the kinetic study was based on the content present in the literature, and the simulation was performed on the software Aspen Plus® V10, including the energy and economic analyses. Considering the importance of optimizing the industrial process for biodiesel production and improving its economic aspects, the main target of this study is to demonstrate how the use of different alcohols for the esterification and transesterification reactions may enrich these previously reported vital aspects.

AB  - Hydraulic oil degrades expediently during operating at elevated temperatures, and due to oil degradation, malfunction of all hydraulic components starts that hampers the hydraulic functioning of the machine. An inefficient component of the hydraulic system converts useful energy into heat. Overheating starts when the rate of heat energy escaping from the system overcomes the rate of heat dissipation. Viscosity, total acidic number (TAN), rheology, and FTIR analyses were carried out on the oil samples collected chronically, and the reasons for degradation and sludge formation were evaluated; the results showed that thermal cracking resistance capacity of the oil was low due to the imbalance percentage of additives in the base oil. Sludge impaired the system efficiency and prejudicially creates repercussions on power consumption. Sludge can be recycled for biofuel and to avoid imbalance in the ecosystem. The test result is plotted in a 3D view graph using the MATLAB R 2019 software for a better explanation. Variation in the behaviour of the hydraulic fluid with respect to time, temperature, shear stress, and shear rate was studied, and the result is validated with correlation and regression analyses. © 2021 MohdAhteshamHussain Siddiqui et al.

AB  - A systematic comparison of the use of trioxane and depolymerized paraformaldehyde as formaldehyde precursors for the acetalization of methanol to dimethoxymethane was performed, using the acidic ion exchange resin, Amberlyst 15, as catalyst. Experiments were carried out under isothermal conditions in batch and continuous fixed-bed reactors. The influence of the main operating parameters, temperature (80–120 °C), space time (2.7–6.2 kg h m−3), and feed concentration (12–22 wt% of trioxane/formaldehyde, 2.5 wt% of water on methanol) on reaction rate and product selectivity were evaluated. When using trioxane as reactant, dimethoxymethane is the main reaction product, with more than 90% selectivity. The catalyst was found to be stable during all the experiments (more than 30 h on stream). However, water caused a reversible inhibitory effect on reaction rate, which can be accounted for by using a competitive adsorption model. A mechanistic kinetic model was proposed and validated using the experimental results. When trioxane is used as reactant, its decomposition to formaldehyde was found to be the rate-limiting step of the reaction mechanism (activation energy 73.1 kJ mol−1). This was confirmed with additional experiments, in which trioxane was replaced by depolymerized formaldehyde. In this case, reaction rate considerably increased. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Biodiesel is widely recognized as an environmentally friendly biofuel. The key to the industrial production of biodiesel is the cost of components, especially that of the feedstock. In this study, a green pulsed ultrasound-assisted synthesis method for biodiesel production is reported. The biodiesel was prepared from waste cooking oil by transesterification in the presence of KOH, a homogeneous catalyst, under pulsed high-intensity ultrasonic treatment. The effects of various experimental parameters such as catalyst type, catalyst dosage, molar ratio of oil to methanol, temperature, ultrasonic power, and ultrasonic pulse mode were investigated. The results demonstrated that KOH had high catalytic performance compared to a heterogeneous K3PO4 catalyst for the transesterification of waste cooking oil. The yield of biodiesel reached up to 91.5% in 120 min of reaction time under the most optimal reaction conditions. The reaction conditions included a catalyst dose of 3% KOH, oil to methanol molar ratio of 1:6, temperature of 55°C, ultrasonic intensity of 260 W, and pulse mode of 9 s on/1 s off. Kinetic studies were conducted to obtain the rate constants at various reaction temperatures. The kinetic rate constant was observed to increase with increasing temperatures, and the activation energy for the ultrasonic method was calculated to be 35.9 kJ/mol. Hence, this green method shows great potential for applications in biodiesel production. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The rapid increase in human population and industrialization have caused severe environmental impacts, such as the depletion of energy and water resources, increase in carbon emissions, and contamination of water bodies. Thus, innovative ways to reduce these issues are essential and also a challenge. In this regard, the circular bioeconomy model has attracted attention, since it aims the sustainable production, utilization of renewable resources, and conversion into value-added products. Microalgal biotechnology represents a promising approach to this concept. These microorganisms can convert nutrients from solid, liquid, and gaseous wastes into biomass with potential as a feedstock for obtaining bioproducts. The simultaneous or sequential extraction of these products in a microalgae-based biorefinery could be an alternative to improve the economic feasibility of the process. Hence, this review article highlights the application of microalgae to carry out waste treatment and produce biofuels and biofertilizers within the circular bioeconomy concept. The challenges and opportunities are also briefly addressed.

AB  - Lignocellulose-bearing sediments are legacies of the previously unregulated wastewater discharge from the pulp and paper industry, causing large quantities of toxic organic waste on the Baltic Sea floor and on the bottom of rivers and lakes. Several km2 are covered with deposits of lignocellulosic residues, typically heavily contaminated with complex mixtures of organic and inorganic pollutants, posing a serious threat to human and ecological health. The high toxicity and the large volume of the polluted material are challenges for remediation endeavours. The lignocellulosic material is also a considerable bioresource with a high energy density, and due to its quantity, it could appeal to commercialization as feedstock for various marketable goods. This study sets out to explore the potential of using this polluted material as a resource for industrial production at the same time as it is detoxified. Information about modern production methods for lignocellulosic material that can be adapted to a polluted feedstock is reviewed. Biochemical methods such as composting, anaerobic digestion, as well as, thermochemical methods, for instance, HTC, HTL, pyrolysis, gasification and torrefaction have been assessed. Potential products from lignocellulose-bearing sediment material include biochar, liquid and gaseous biofuels, growing substrate. The use of a contaminated feedstock may make the process more expensive, but the suggested methods should be seen as an alternative to remediation methods that only involve costs. Several experiments were highlighted that support the conception that combined remediation and generation of marketable goods may be an appropriate way to address polluted lignocellulose-bearing sediments.

AB  - This article reports the deliverables of the experimental study on the production of a completely renewable biofuel from Manilkara zapota fruit and seed oil. It was attempted to synthesis ethyl ester from Manilkara zapota seed oil using bioethanol synthesized from decayed Manilkara zapota fruit. Bioethanol was produced through fermentation of decayed Manilkara zapota fruit, waste skin, and pulp with Saccharomyces cerevisiae and then distilled at 72°C. The bioethanol yield was noted as 10.45% (v/w). The 95.09% pure bioethanol and 4.9% water molecules were present in the distilled sample. Mechanically extracted raw Manilkara zapota seed oil was used for ethyl ester conversion. The molar ratio of bioethanol to oil, the quantity of KOH, and process temperature were investigated for the maximum yield of Manilkara zapota ethyl ester. A 9:1 molar ratio of bioethanol to oil, 1.5% (w/w) KOH, and 70°C process temperature were identified as enhanced ethanolysis process parameters. The maximum yield of ethyl ester was identified as 93.1%. Physicochemical characteristics of Manilkara zapota oil, bioethanol, and ethyl ester were measured as per the corresponding ASTM standards. It was found that both Manilkara Zapota ethyl ester and bioethanol synthesized from decayed Manilkara zapota fruit could be promising substitutes for fossil diesel and gasoline. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Researchers have studied how biofuels are supplied through the oil supply chain to achieve promising results. An optimization model for the gas-oil and biodiesel supply chains suggesting the optimization of both supply chains simultaneously was developed. The proposed model deals with the connection points of two supply chains and determines the two chains’ connection points by considering two economic and environmental objective functions. The model could be used to make decisions on issues,e.g., location, allocation, production planning, inventory management, and capacity expansion. The proposed programming model’s performance has been studied through a real case study in Iran and the sensitivity analyses were carried out. The e-constraint method was used to solve the multiobjective model. The proposed model is expected to be effective in the future management of countries’ fuel sources, particularly to be used as an alternative to fossil fuels."

AB  - Upgradation of pyrolysis oil is a key process to achieve high-quality biofuel. In this study, the effects of different Ar pressures and H2/Ar ratios in the presence and absence of catalysts on deoxygenation of pyrolysis oil were investigated by autoclaving. When the initial pressure of the reaction is 6MPa and without catalyst addition, the content of carboxylic acid decreases from 51.52 to 41.54%, whereas with the addition of catalyst (10 % Ni/C), the deoxygenation and hydrocarbon content in the product were significantly improved. Hence, 6 MPa was found to be optimum and above which failed to induce such useful changes but can lead to lower high heating value (HHV). However, the presence of hydrogen affects the content of alkanes and olefins in the product. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Production of biogas using bioresources of agricultural origin plays an important role in Europe’s energy transition to sustainability. However, many substrates have been denounced in the last years as a result of differences of opinion on its impact on the environment, while finding new resources for renewable energy is a global issue. The aim of the study is to use a carbon balance method to evaluate the real impact on the atmosphere by carrying out a carbon balance to objectively quantify naturally or anthropogenically added or removed carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This study uses Latvian data to determine the environmental impact of biogas production depending on the choice of substrate, in this case from specially grown maize silage. GHG emissions from specially grown maize use and cultivation (including the use of diesel fuel, crop residue and nitrogen fertilizer incorporation, photosynthesis), biogas production leaks, as well as digestate emissions (including digestate emissions and also saved nitrogen emissions by the use of digestate) are taken into account when compiling the carbon balance of maize. The results showed that biogas production from specially grown maize can save 1.86 kgCO2eq emissions per 1 m3 of produced biogas. © 2021, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool. All rights reserved.

AB  - Currently in Brazil the minimum content of biodiesel in mixtures is 11% and, according to Brazilian laws, the goal is to reach 15% in volume in diesel fuel available for final consumers by 2023. Therefore, studies about different matrices of biodiesel and distinct mixtures are essential. The present work had two goals, the first one was to analyse physico-chemical properties of 16 biofuels produced from soybean and cotton oils, using S10 diesel, in mixtures B8, B10, B20 and B30. The second goal was to verify the vantages and disadvantages of biodiesel production through prior mixing of the oils, before and after the transesterification process. All biofuels produced presented results of specific mass values at 20 °C and kinematic viscosity at 40 °C within the limits established by ANP Resolution no 30/2016 and International Resolutions. The soybean B20 biofuel showed the best overall results, with the second highest production yield of 65.36%, the fifth lowest kinematic viscosity with 3.48 mm s-1. The mixture of soybean and cotton oils before the transesterification process presented the highest production yield when compared with the production from a single oil or biodiesel mixtures. The results found proved to be satisfactory and corroborate to continue with the increase of biodiesel in the mixture with diesel to B15 until 2023 and support the possibility of planning for a gradual increase of this mixture in the following years. © 2021, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool.

AB  - The development of green energy is important to mitigate global warming. Jatropha (Jatropha curcas L.) is a promising candidate for the production of alternative biofuel, which could reduce the burden on the Earth’s resources. Jatropha seeds contain a large quantity of lipids that can be used to produce biofuel, and the rest of the plant has many other uses. Currently, techniques for plant genetic transformation are extensively employed to study, create, and improve the specific characteristics of the target plant. Successful transformation involves the alteration of plants and their genetic materials. The aim of this study was to generate Jatropha plants that can support biofuel production by increasing their seed size using genes found via the rice FOX-hunting system. The present study improved previous protocols, enabling the production of transgenic Jatropha in two steps: the first step involved using auxins and dark incubation to promote root formation in excised shoots and the second step involved delaying the timing of antibiotic selection in the cultivation medium. Transgenic plants were subjected to PCR analysis; the transferred gene expression was confirmed via RT-PCR and the ploidy level was investigated. The results suggest that the genes associated with larger seed size in Arabidopsis thaliana, which were found using the rice FOX-hunting system, produce larger seeds in Jatropha. © 2021 Japanese Society for Plant Biotechnology.

AB  - The present experimental work is carried out to analyse the performance, combustion, and exhaust emission characteristics of variable compression ratio (VCR) diesel engine using blended biofuel (B20) with nanoadditives. Transesterified biodiesel was prepared from waste cooking oil (WCO). The cerium oxide nanoparticles (CERIA) were produced and categorized by precipitation technique, SEM and XRD analysis. These nanoadditives mixed with biofuel blend by magnetic stirrer and then by ultrasonication. The test procedure was carried out under the following fuel blends: 20% of biodiesel added to 80% diesel (B20), 15ppm, 30ppm, 45ppm, 60ppm and 75ppm cerium oxide nanoparticles added with B20 blend (diesel, B20, B20+CERIA15, B20+CERIA30, B20+CERIA45, B20+CERIA60, B20+CERIA75). The engine was operated at fixed compression ratio 20:1 and constant speed at various load conditions 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, and results were compared to diesel at 100% load. The improvement in B20 fuel characteristics was observed by adding cerium oxide nanoparticles. The outcomes indicate better improvement in the blended sample of B20+CERIA45 ppm with brake thermal efficiency increased by 3.62% and specific fuel consumption decreased by 3.3% than the neat diesel. Presence of added particles gives better atomization which prompts total burning in the combustion chamber and builds up the amplified pressure data. The emission of CO and HC outflow dimnishes by the addition of CERIA nanoparticles in blended biofuel. Additionally, there is a reduction in NOx by expanding the CERIA dosage in the fuel mixer. This occurs due to CERIA particles presented in a fuel blend behaving as an oxygen buffer and engaging the O2 for decreasing the NOx formation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Green diesel is a second-generation biofuel developed in response to the increasing demand for liquid fuel and the predicted decrease in the availability of fossil fuels, especially diesel as the main liquid fuel used in transportation vehicles. Green diesel can be produced via deoxygenation from various feedstocks, such as vegetable oils, animal fats, fatty acids, and waste cooking oils. Normally, the deoxygenation reaction in green diesel production occurs in a multiphase system. There are three main pathways in the liquid phase of the reaction: decarboxylation, decarbonylation, and hydrodeoxygenation, from which liquid alkane hydrocarbons can be derived, and these are known as green diesel. This review paper discusses several deoxygenation pathways in a multiphase-reaction process to produce green diesel. Nickel metal is a non-noble metal catalyst which has been confirmed from many studies for use in deoxygenation with good performance. The performance of the nickel catalyst depends on different factors including the type of catalyst support and promoter, reaction temperature, reaction pressure, and reaction time. Finally, recent progress and future trends in green diesel production are discussed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Main objective of research is to study the combustion, emission and performance of an available BS IV (Bharath Stage) diesel engine. Research replaced the original neat diesel which was used as fuel with the diesel blended with alcohols. The emission parameters observed were the proportion of CO, CO2, NOx and HC in the exhaust gas and was compared with that of pure diesel. A drop can be observed in the brake specific fuel consumption when compared to that of diesel. The levels of NOx also showed only some minor variations, however the blended fuels proved to have lower NOx emission than diesel. Only the ratio of unburnt hydrocarbons was high when compared with diesel for all the loads. The rate of decrease for the blended fuel was more than that of diesel. The change was negligible in the proportion of CO2 emission. It can be seen that the percentage of CO emission was maximum at initial loads and exponentially decreased with increase in load. The rates of decrease of brake thermal efficiency for the diesel-alcohol blends were more than the diesel. It was observed that there was a drop in brake power, brake fuel consumption and mechanical efficiency. © 2021, Scibulcom Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The need for sustainability necessitates intensive research on using renewable resources to produce biofuels and biochemicals. The esterification of commercial levulinic acid (LA) into ethyl levulinate (EL) was first optimized using methanesulfonic acid (MsOH) and response surface methodology (RSM). The optimum condition for the esterification of commercial LA into EL was 5.25 h, 90 °C and 2.75 g of MsOH loading. The EL yield and selectivity obtained were 92.2% and 94%, respectively, at a LA conversion of 98%. The effect of various catalysts which are less corrosive and environmentally friendly, namely MsOH and ionic liquids (ILs), was investigated under fixed conditions to determine the best catalyst for the production of EL from LA. The alkyl levulinate ester selectivity from LA conversion was also studied by using linear and branched chain alcohols. The alkyl levulinate ester, ethyl levulinate, was produced from depithed sugarcane bagasse (DSB)-derived LA using a less corrosive homogenous catalyst (methanesulfonic acid). The reaction conditions of 5.25 h, 90 °C and 2.75 g of MsOH loading were used to produce EL from DSB-derived LA with an EL yield of 75%. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This paper aims to reduce the fuel demand for diesel engines through biofuel generation from the waste cooking oil and introducing eco-friendly catalysts from bull bones. The prepared catalyst was characterised to ensure its property before use. The bubble wash method was employed in the waste cooking oil. The transterification process was employed in the production of biofuel. The produced biofuel was characterised to ensure its fuel properties requirement for diesel engine. The primary screening of biodiesel was conducted to optimise the Waste Cooking Oil (WCO) blend with diesel. That is the 20, 40, 60, and 80% mixes with diesel oil and pure WCO (that is B20, B40, B60, B80 and B100) were tested and B20 was initially optimised. The eight kinds of fuels and blends prepared like diesel, B20, B20 with 5% DEE, B20 with 10% DEE, B20 with 5% ethanol, 10% ethanol, B20 with 5% methanol, B20 with 10% methanol were tested in the diesel engine with compression ratios of 15:1 and 18:1 at 5 different load conditions between 0 and 100%. The factorial design and ANOVA tools were used to optimise the experimental data statistically. The compression ratio was optimised and then the optimised fuel and compression ratio was used for further optimisation with negligible emissions like velocity, crank angle and computational fluid dynamics. © 2021, Scibulcom Ltd..

AB  - Emissions emanating from gas turbine are important and critical in terms of environmental impact. In general, oxides of nitrogen, total unburned hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and soot particles are the most significant emissions from gas-turbine combustion systems. In order to reduce these emissions, fuels derived from bio-origin are being increasingly used for gas-turbine combustion. Since aviation accounts for more than 5% of anthropogenic emissions, and also due to increasing pressure from governments across the globe for emission reduction, it is important to investigate pathways to reduce aviation-generated emissions. We, therefore, propose the use of Jatropha-based bio-derived synthetic paraffinic kerosene (SPK) blended with aviation turbine fuel (ATF)-Jet A1, and experimentally investigate the emission characteristics within a laboratory-scale gas-turbine combustor from proposed fuel blends. The investigation is done for two different operating conditions: operating condition 1 (OC1) and operating condition 2 (OC2). The influence of emission characteristics of the two biofuel blends, namely BF-II and BF-IV, are analyzed and compared with that of neat ATF-Jet A1. A substantial reduction of 33.5% in THC, 20% in CO, 42% in soot and increase of 40% in NOx and 28.7% in CO2 emissions are evident for BF-II fuel in comparison to ATF with OC1. However, at OC2, these emission reductions are less with increased NOx emissions of 50.2% in comparison to that of ATF. In addition, for the fuel BF-IV, there have been reductions of 57.2% THC, 33.3% CO, 67.1% soot and increase of 49.4% NOx and 43.9% CO2 emissions as compared with ATF at OC1. Also THC, CO, soot, and CO2 emissions are reduced considerably with increased NOx emissions for BF-IV fuel at OC2. © 2021 Nand Jee Kanu, Suresh Guluwadi, Vivek Pandey and S Suyambazhahan.

AB  - The use of renewable fuels has emerged as an important method for reducing fossil-fuel consumption. Different pathway technologies can lead to different fuel products. The feasibility of many such pathways has been analyzed with mixed results but new technologies are being developed continuously. This study uses stochastic analysis to determine the feasibility of producing biofuels from carinata oil using catalytic hydrothermolysis (CH) technology. We perform the analysis with and without government incentive programs. We also address uncertainties in input costs and government incentives. The study analyzes a pioneer greenfield plant. The results show that the mean net present value (NPV) without government incentives is −$924.4 million. Ninety percent of the simulated NPV is between −$1040 million and −$810 million, which indicates a 100% probability of loss. The mean breakeven price of jet fuel is $4.72 gal–1. With government incentives including Renewable Identification Number (RIN) and Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), the mean NPV is $62.3, and the probability of loss is reduced to 21%, which makes the process much more financially feasible. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - Advanced biofuels possess superior characteristics to serve for gasoline substitutes. In this study, a whole cell biocatalysis system was employed for production of short-chain alcohols from corresponding fatty acids. To do so, Escherichia coli strain was equipped with a biocatalytic pathway consisting of endogenous atoDA and Clostridium acetobutylicum adhE2. The strain was further reprogrammed to improve its biocatalytic activity by direction the glycolytic flux to acetyl-CoA and recycling acetate. The production of 1-propanol and n-pentanol were exemplified with the engineered strain. By substrate (glucose and propionate) feeding, the strain enabled production of 5.4 g/L 1-propanol with productivity reaching 0.15 g/L/h. In addition, the strain with a heavy inoculum was implemented for the n-pentanol production from n-pentanoic acid. The production titer and productivity finally attained 4.3 g/L and 0.86 g/L/h, respectively. Overall, the result indicates that this developed system is useful and effective for biocatalytic production of short-chain alcohols. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - An economical way to reduce oil consumption and environmental problems in fuel production is the production of biodiesel from by-products and waste materials. By-products from the vegetable oil refining industry such as soap stock, acid oil, and fatty acid distillates are suitable for biodiesel production. In this study, biodiesel production was made using deodorizer distillate, which is the last step of the sunflower oil refining stage. Sunflower oil deodorizer distillate (SODD) obtained from oil facilities in Thrace region, and it was examined whether the fuel characteristics of the produced biodiesel comply with EN 14214 and ASTM D6751 standards. Biodiesel production from SODD was based on acidic catalysis method. H2SO4 was used as catalyst and methanol as alcohol. Catalyst amount, methanol to SODD ratio, reaction temperature and reaction time parameters were studied and optimum conditions were determined. As a result of the studies, the highest biodiesel yield was obtained in 1 wt% H2SO4, 12:1 methanol to SODD ratio, 65 °C reaction temperature, and 9-h reaction time. Biodiesel achieved 98.98% methyl ester concentration and 94.32% biodiesel yield. In addition, comparison of fuel properties of synthesized biodiesel with ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 showed well-matched values. Our study thus recommends SODD as a non-edible potential feedstock for biofuel production and industrial purposes.

AB  - Palm fatty acid distillate PFAD is an example of potential low-cost palm biofuel second generation feedstock, most used as a source of fatty acid for non-food applications in industry. Catalytic application of Oxone® salt was used in the present study for the esterification reaction of PFAD for biodiesel production for the first time. After optimizing the conversion rate, was possible to observe that, among the process variables studied [Oxone® concentration (%), temperature (°C) and reaction time (h)], Oxone® concentration was the only significant variable for the fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) generation response variable. A > 90% conversion rate was reached with 15% Oxone® at 42 °C, using a PFAD:ethanol molar ratio of 1:5 at 12 h reaction time. The reaction system has a series of advantages, such as mild conditions, simple operation, green and high conversion. As alternative for make the biodiesel production as sustainable as possible.

AB  - According to India’s National Biofuel Policy, only non-edible oilseed crops can be used for the biofuel feedstock. In this context, Camelina sativa is one such plant that fulfils all the criteria defined by the Biofuel policies of India. So, the present investigation was aimed to examine C. sativa seed oil capabilities as a biodiesel feedstock. Oil was deacidified via adsorption method apply-ing Silica Gel as an adsorbent. The highest efficacy was obtained when 1:9 (Silica gel: oil) ratio was applied and the acid value was reduced from 6.45 to 2.78 mg KOH/g. Furthermore, oil was transesterified using methanol in the ratio of 1:6 (oil: methanol molar ratio) and 0.8 % (w/w of oil) of KOH as a catalyst at 70 °C. The produced biodiesel was analyzed in terms of fuel-specific parameters and results were compared with American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards. The results were very much satisfactory and under the limits specified by the ASTM standards. The results revealed that oil to biodiesel conver-sion was 92.28 % with an acid value of 0.37 mg KOH/g. The measured Iodine value was 152 gI2/100g indicated the high unsat-uration. Still, Camelina biodiesel showed oxidation stability of 6 h., which was a decent value compared to this much unsatura-tion. The sulphur content was also higher (24 ppm) than the specified limit (15 ppm). Besides, the fuel-specific parameters like sulphur content and iodine value were under the ASTM limits. © Author (s).

AB  - Microalgae are considered promising feedstocks for biofuel and bio-product generation. The algal carbohydrates can be hydrolyzed into sugars before their fermentation into ethanol. In this study, nutrient limitation strategy was employed to evaluate the biochemical composition of Chlorella sorokiniana. Limiting nitrate (1.0 g/L KNO3) in the culture medium increased the total carbohydrate and starch content of microalga by 50.28 and 34.06%, respectively. However, this significantly lowered their yield due to low microalgal biomass production. Cultivation of C. sorokiniana cells with 4.0 g/L KNO3 as nitrogen source for 8 days was optimum for bioethanol production as the highest total carbohydrate yield of 422.44 mg/L was obtained under these conditions. Nitrate limitation (1.0 g/L KNO3) favored the increased production of high-value carotenoids in C. sorokiniana that could further contribute to improving the economics of the bioethanol production process. Feasibility studies for ethanol production from C. sorokiniana revealed that a maximum of 13.86 mg/mL of reducing sugars was extracted in the hydrolysate by treating the microalgal biomass with 2.8% sulfuric acid at 121 °C for 30 min. Fermentation of acid hydrolysate produced ethanol at a concentration of 2.91 mg/mL in 96 h with 41.16% of theoretical yield. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Microalgae research has attracted interest worldwide and in order to advance algal biotechnology in Brazil, government has been funding several projects. In the last 10 years, two main funds were provided by the National Council of Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) agency to researchers in Brazil, who study the potential uses of microalgae for biomass, bioproducts and biofuels production. These funded projects addressed aspects of algal strain identification, development of algal cultivation techniques, designing photobioreactors and raceway ponds, modeling harvesting and dewatering process, maximizing biomass and oil productivities, characterizing chemical composition with different extractions systems and determining physiochemical properties of biodiesel. This review presents the state of art of algal research conducted by Brazilian institutions. Special attention is given to the recent progress on microalgal cultivation, high-value products extracted from microalgae and potential biofuels production. This review may serve as a policy instrument for planning next steps for algal research in Brazil as well as for attracting attention from international researchers who work with microalgae and would like to pursue a future partnership on algal research with Brazilian research institutions. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Broad assessment is being directed everywhere by the researchers on the world to identify the alternative sources for eco-friendly fuel. In the present investigation, biodiesel was integrated from the waste avocado seeds. Since the seed is a bio-squander that has the fundamental supplements and unsaturated fats, there is a need to use this waste and convert them into a valuable item. The biodiesel production process includes two-step processes. The first step is extraction of oil from the seed by using ethanol as a solvent. The viable extraction was obtained with the optimum conditions were found to be at 80°C, with the solvent to feed the proportion of 7:2, 3 hours of extraction time. Kinetic models were developed for the extraction processes with an R2 value of 0.959 and 0.989. The second step is producing biodiesel from the extracted oil by transesterification process. Operating conditions used for the trans-esterification reaction were observed to be 60°C, KOH to oil weight proportion of 1% and oil to methanol mole proportion 1:6. The biodiesel properties were estimated and contrasted and benchmarks which demonstrated that the biodiesel could be utilized as an elective vitality asset in diesel engines. This research work comprises two principle goals. Initially, a numerical model was obtained to anticipate the best states of extraction of lipids from a dried avocado seed. Second, utilizing the lipid separated from the seed, the biodiesel must be produced. GCMS examined the acquired biodiesel, and the diesel properties were investigated. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The novelty of this study discusses on the influence of neat lemongrass oil (LGO) on fuel analysis, performance and emission analysis, naturally aspirated diesel engine. The critical parameters include iodine value, flash point, kinematic viscosity, saponification and cetane numbers, calorific value, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) studies were investigated. The oxygenated elements, such as naphthalene, caryophyllene, pentadecanoic acid, dihydropyridine, d-limonene are observed using GC-MS analysis. The higher hydrocarbon (HC) chain length indicates a rise in energy density and boiling point with a reduction of volatility. Using FT-IR analysis, C–H stretching vibrations are found at a frequency of 1672 cm−1. The C≐C stretching vibrations at 1740 cm−1 reveals the availability of the alkenes/fingerprint phase. Experiments were conducted at four different volumetric blend ratios of LGO-diesel blends at typical injection parameters under different loading conditions. Brake thermal efficiency (BTE) decreased for all the test combinations of LGO than diesel. BTE is observed as 30.79% at diesel, 30.06% at LGO25, 28.71% at LGO50, 27.77% at LGO75%, and 27.23% at LGO100. The cylinder pressure and heat release rate increased proportionately with the LGO fuel mixture. Carbon monoxide, HC, and smoke emissions are reduced by LGO mixtures than diesel at the full load of the engine. It was noted that greater blends of LGO and diesel resulted in increased nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions and engine tribological characteristics. The NOx is increased by 21.2% at LGO25, 24.3% at LGO50, 26.5% at LGO75 and 30.8% at LGO100 when compared with diesel. Without any chemical processing, Cymbopogon flexuosus oil can be blended directly with diesel fuel. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - Using information from an experimental planting of non-toxic Jatropha curcas (NTJC) with minimal water and fertilization resources on rural marginal soil the objective of this article is to determine the sustainability of this raw material for producing biodiesel and the possibilities for improving it through life-cycle assessment (LCA). Three production scenarios were studied: minimal resources (MR), which focuses on the obtaining of biodiesel; minimal resources and utilization of sub-products (MRUS), which includes the utilization of the residual products in order to produce food and solid biofuels, as well as biodiesel; and utilization of biofertilizers, flood irrigation, and sub-products (UBIS), which incorporates the use of bio-fertilizers and irrigation in the production system. This study includes the selection of six sustainability indicators, as well as indicators by means of LCA methodology Finally, a sustainability index (SI) for each scenario was determined on the basis of an index of environmental sustainability of energy products (IESEP). Our results indicated that the MR scenario yielded the lowest SI 0.673, while the MRUS scenario had the highest SI 0.956. It concludes that sustainability is greater when it utilizes minimal water and fertilization resources during the raw material production stage, and the residual products are used for food and energy products made possible by the non-toxic properties of Jatropha curcas. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The continued burning of fossil fuels since the beginning of the last century led to higher emissions of greenhouse gases and thus leads to global warming. Microalgae are one of the most important sources of green hydrocarbons because this type of algae has a high percentage of lipids and has rapid growth, consumes the carbon dioxide in large quantities. Besides, the cultivation of these types of algae does not require arable land. This review aims to explain the suitability of microalgae as a biofuel source depending on the fat content, morphology, and other parameters and their effect on the conversion processes of microalgae oil into biofuels by different zeolite catalytic reactions. It also discusses in detail the major chemical processes that convert microalgae oil to chemical products. This review sheds light on one of the most important groups of microalgae (Chlorella vulgaris microalgae). This review includes a historical overview and a comprehensive description of the structure needed to develop this type of algae. The most important methods of production, their advantages and disadvantages are also deliberated in this work. Copyright © 2021 by Authors, Published by BCREC Group.

AB  - Biodiesels possess enhanced emission characteristics in comparison with neat diesel; therefore, biodiesel can be considered as a substitute for diesel and if blended with diesel, gives enhanced performance characteristics. In this study, tests on the performance of engine were carried out at a different number of nozzle holes (HN), the weight percentage of blends, and loads with the main focus to identify the optimal process parameter which minimizes Brake Specific Energy Consumption (BSEC), maximize Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTE), and minimize emission parameters like smoke, Carbon monoxide (CO), Hydrocarbon (HC), and Nitrogen oxides (NOx). The design of the experiment was based on the RSM Design of experiments. Using the RSM desirability function, process parameters are optimized for better performance. The influence of process parameters on responses is investigated using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Blending ratio has the maximum percentage contribution of 47.64% and 61.04% for BSEC and NOx, the load has the maximum percentage contribution of 39.69% and 65.12% for BTE and smoke, respectively, HN has a maximum percentage contribution of 80.6% and 56.41% for CO and HC, respectively. The optimal parameters of six holes in the fuel injector, 20% of biofuel with 80% of diesel, and 65% of load are identified. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The increasing demand for energy and the fact that petroleum, which is the most used energy source, has a limited reserve, have led researchers to search for new and renewable energy sources. In this context, biofuels such as biodiesel and bio alcohols have been studied and used in internal combustion engines for a long time. However, with the developments in technology, the production and use of such alternative fuels in different engine technologies is still a subject of research. In this regard, isopropanol-butanol-ethanol (IBE) has received an increasing attention over standard alcohols and its potential as a substitute for other alcohol fuels in internal combustion engines has been researched recently. Therefore, the purpose of the experimental study is to investigate the effect of biodiesel addition at rates of 20% and 40% by volume in a blend of IBE (30% v/v) with petroleum-based diesel (70% v/v) on the combustion and emission characteristics of a single-cylinder common-rail direct injection engine at constant engine speed of 2400 rpm and 60% load conditions. Experimental results showed that all blended fuels presented a potential to reduce smoke opacity by 27% − 41%, CO emissions by 44% − 66% and unburnt HC emissions (up to 31.8%) but increase NOx emissions by 5% − 24.6% compared to diesel. However, adding biodiesel caused to a slight increase in smoke opacity and CO emissions while decrease in unburned HC and NOx emissions compared to the blend of IBE and diesel. Combustion analysis also showed that the use of blended fuels led to the increase of peak cylinder pressure (by 7%) and the significant improvement in the rate of heat release was observed, which further increased with the addition of biodiesel to blend of IBE and diesel. It was concluded that ternary blends was performed better than the blend of IBE and diesel while biodiesel addition was found to be beneficial in terms of reduction of unburnt HC and NOx emissions along with improved performance. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Synthesizing ring structure aviation fuels from biomass-derived platform molecules is challenging, especially for bridged ring structure aviation fuels which are typically achieved from fossil-derived chemicals. Herein, we report the synthesis of a series of ring structure biofuels in two steps by a combination of a solvent-free Michael-cyclization reaction and a hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reaction from lignocellulose-derived 5,5-dimethyl-1,3-cyclohexanedione. These biofuels are obtained with high overall yields up to 90%, which exhibit high densities of 0.81 g cm−3-0.88 g cm−3 and high volumetric neat heat of combustion (VNHOC) values of 36.0 MJ L−1-38.6 MJ L−1. More importantly, bridged-ring structure hydrocarbons can also be achieved in two steps by a combination of a Robinson annulation reaction and an HDO reaction to afford the final products at high overall yields up to 90%. The bridged-ring structure products have comparable high densities and high VNHOC values to the best artificial fuel JP-10 (0.94 g cm−3 and 39.6 MJ L−1). The results demonstrate a promising way for the synthesis of high-density aviation fuels with different fuel properties at high yields. © 2021 Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences

AB  - The high content of silica is present in beach sand and this silica can be synthesized into mesoporous silica (MS) using the sonochemistry assisted with dodecyl-amine (DDA) as a surfactant template. The preparation began by adding sodium silicate dropwise to DDA solution under the rotation speed of 120 rpm. The mixture was then added with H2SO4 and sonicated at 37 kHz at a temperature of 35 °C for 20 min. The product was then filtered, washed, and dried at 50 °C then calcined at 600 °C for 5 h. After it was calcined, the sample was characterized by using FTIR, Surface Area Analyzer, XRD, SEM, and TEM as well as the acidity using pyridine vapour adsorption. The synthesized MS was then used as a catalyst in hydrocracking waste cooking oil in a semi-batch stainless steel reactor system at 450 °C for 2 h, under 20 ml/min H2 flow rate. The hydrocracking product of the liquid fraction was analyzed using GC-MS. The results showed that the best performance of the MS1 was produced by using the DDA concentration of 0.1 M. It had optimum acidity at 1.7 mmol/g specific surface area of 233 m2/g, with the total pore volume of 0.4 cc/g, and average pore diameter of 7.70 nm. The best MS1 catalyst produced liquid fraction with a yield of 31.13 wt.% which consisted of 11.10% diesel oil and 5.04% gasoline. © 2021, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Waste treatment is an important part of the future global energy portfolio. Challenges associated with implementing energy recovery technology at waste treatment sites include interwoven technical, economic, and policy considerations. This work focuses on the tradeoff of input waste energy content to output electrical power, i.e. efficiency for waste-to-energy systems. Also presented is an approach for conversion technology selection based on characteristics of the waste stream, energy content of biogas generated from anaerobic waste treatment, and commercial applicability of five major prime movers across a large gradient of power output including: gas turbines, steam turbines, microturbines, reciprocating internal combustion engines, and solid oxide fuel cells. An efficiency model developed from fundamental thermodynamic principles is used to estimate the amount of power available from a waste treatment site, using data from a comprehensive data set of prime mover characteristics. A case study is presented, illustrating prime mover selection for three types of waste systems in Minnesota, United States: wastewater treatment plants, landfill sites and dairy farms. The results show that gas and steam turbines are recommended for large-scale systems with millions of gallons per day of wastewater generation, up to 60% of waste treatment sites. For small-scale systems applicable to distributed waste treatment and wastewater treatment facilities processing less than 10,000 gallons of water per day, fuel cells are recommended solely based on their high efficiency. Given the potential growth of decentralized waste-to-energy, the scarcity of highly efficient, affordable and fuel flexible power generation options necessitates further innovation in small-scale prime mover technologies. Implications: Energy recovery from waste has not reached its potential due to several decision-influencing factors and technical challenges. Here an efficiency model is presented that theoretically validates efficiency curves for prime movers often shown in previous literature, but without physical verification. The developed regime model has significant practical utility as it concisely estimates power generation potential of a given waste treatment site. This work decouples decision factors by providing a practical template to better identify applicability of a prime mover to waste processing scenarios. In addition, the applicability analysis highlights areas in need of innovation, technology, and policy to address the changing landscape of waste treatment scale and potential opportunity to recover energy from small-scale distributed treatment facilities. © 2021 A&WMA.

AB  - In Brazil, since most of the fleet consists of flexible-fuel vehicles, the ethanol-to-gasoline price ratio affect demand. In this study, we address the asymmetric behavior of demand estimating a dynamic panel with threshold effect. Based on municipal data from 2007 to 2017, we estimate a threshold close to 71% for ethanol and 66% for gasoline. The estimated elasticities differ from one regime to another, depending on the ethanol-to-gasoline price ratio. Our findings therefore contribute to an understanding of how price ratio affects the demand for both fuels, supporting the design of public policies aimed at a transition to biofuels. © 2021.

AB  - The ongoing depletion of fossil resources, the energetic autonomy of countries, soaring prices for petroleum and climate change have stimulated research and development on renewable energy as biofuels. In this work, a bibliometric analysis of the Web of Science database was carried out to identify the research related to sugar beet to biofuels. The equation logistic was used to quantitatively describe the growth of the publication of sugar beet in the biofuels field. The results show that the publications of sugar beet for biofuel have a rate of growth of 0-1898 year−1. Germany and the USA were the countries with high influence for research in the field of sugar beet for biofuels. The journal Zuckerindustrie was the referent to publications in the field of study. From 2003 to 2019, the exponential growth of publications was found, this profile of growth can be attributed to the development of renewable energy and the relevance of global warming, security energetic and laws that promoted clean energy. This work shows that the logistic equation can be used to predict the evolution of publications in the field of study. © 2021, Econjournals. All rights reserved.

AB  - Today, a growing interest to use Acetone-Butanol-Ethanol (ABE) as a biofuel has emerged. Fuel properties play important roles to determine engine’s performance, combustion, and emission behaviors. Yet, the determination of fuel properties is expensive and time-consuming. Previous studies on ABE did not provide information on how to predict its fuel properties. This study developed an Elman and Cascade neural networks (ENN and CNN) and compared their results with adaptive neuro inference system (ANFIS) to predict ABE’s key fuel properties. Three properties, i.e., calorific value, density, and kinematic viscosity were used as the target outputs, while ABE, acetone, butanol, and ethanol ratio were selected as the input parameters. The ENN and CNN models were trained using 10 different training algorithms, while the ANFIS model was examined using eight unique membership functions. To evaluate the prediction accuracy of each model, six different parameters were employed. Results showed that, compared to ENN and CNN, the ANFIS model gave the best performance accuracy with the least errors to predict the key fuel properties of ABE-diesel blends. For calorific value, density, and kinematic viscosity prediction, the best results of the ANFIS model were given by triangular, Pi curve, and trapezoidal membership functions, respectively. Therefore, ANFIS gave the best model of all the investigated models in this study. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Biofuels are one of the most sought-after renewable energy sources to overcome the current energy crisis in the world. Diesel blended with esters derived from oils has shown appreciable results for its use in compression ignition engines. In this work, B20 (20% biodiesel + 80% diesel by volume) fuel blend comprising 80% diesel and 20% biofuel extracted from waste cooking oil is used as a fuel. Two different metallic oxide nanoparticles (NPs), namely, cerium oxide (CeO2) and aluminium oxide (Al2O3) each having size of 30 nm, are dispersed in B20 biodiesel blend and used to investigate their combined influence on engine combustion. Experiments are conducted to study the engine exhaust emissions of a single cylinder four-stroke diesel engine running at constant speed of 1,500 rpm with varying engine loads. Experiments are carried out with B20 fuel and adding mixtures of CeO2 and Al2O3 nanoparticles in 50–30, 40–40 and 30–50 ppm, respectively, to B20 biodiesel blend. Responses recorded are the emissions of CO, HC, CO2, NOx and smoke. The results reveal that, on adding the nanoparticles, the engine observed a smooth combustion with reduction in the exhaust emissions compared to neat B20 biodiesel operation. B20 blend with 50 ppm of CeO2 and 30 ppm of Al2O3 nanoparticles showed lower exhaust emissions compared to other fuel blends. For the best fuel blend, CO, HC, NOx and smoke are reduced by 57.3%, 22.3%, 24.3% and 7.36%, respectively, compared to neat B20 operation. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - This study analyzed the fuel properties of the bio-oil obtained from pyrolysis of Tectona grandis at different temperatures (400, 500, 600, and 700oC) in a fixed bed reactor. The feedstock was characterized using proximate and ultimate analyses. The elemental composition of the bio-oils as well as their fuel properties, including the pH value, density, viscosity, higher heating value (HHV), moisture and ash content, flash point, pour point, and carbon residue, were determined. The percentage ranges of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen in the bio-oils were 75.80 76.50, 8.93 8.98, 4.24 4.46, 0.11 0.21, and 10.50 10.88 wt.%, respectively. The pH values of the derived bio-oils (2.7 3.3) were lower than those of diesel (5.5 8.0) while their densities at 40oC (1.10 1.15 g/cm3) were comparable to those of fuel oil (0.9101 g/cm3), furnace oil (0.92 g/cm3), and heavy fuel oil (0.9888 g/cm3), measured at 30oC, with their viscosities (29 34 mPas) higher than those of gasoline (< 0.3 mPas) and diesel (3 4 mPas). The HHVs of the bio-oils (36.47 36.76 MJ/kg) were lower than those of gasoline (44 46 MJ/kg) and diesel (42 46 MJ/kg). The flash points of the bio-oils at 500, 600, and 700oC (50, 55, and 48oC, respectively) were lower than that of diesel (58.5oC). With some upgrading, bio-oil from Tectona grandis pyrolysis can be a substitute for conventional liquid fuels. © 2021 Begell House Inc.. All rights reserved.

AB  - Microalgae are increasingly being preferred as sustainable biomass feedstock for biofuels production due to their high growth rate and lipid yield. However, optimal production requires the use of economical native microalgal species which are well adapted to local climatic and ecological conditions. Therefore, this study’s main objective was to isolate and select local microalgal species for prospective biofuels production. Serial dilution and streak plate techniques were used to isolate four species: Chlorella, Scenedesmus, Oscillatoria and Microcystis from Manyame River, Zimbabwe. The isolates were evaluated for their biomass and lipid productivity under artificial lighting (8:16 h light/dark cycle) and a temperature of 25 ± 3°C. Lipid quantification was done gravimetrically, using hexane as an extraction solvent. Each isolate’s performance was compared against that of an imported Chlorella vulgaris strain. Amongst the isolates, Chlorella sp. exhibited a highly competitive growth rate of 0.26 d−1 and lipid yield of 37.16% dry cell weight. In comparison, the imported C. vulgaris had a growth rate of 0.226 d−1 and lipid yield of 35.74% dry cell weight. Although findings suggest that the native Chlorella sp. is the ideal candidate, growth enhancement and genetic engineering techniques may be used to further improve its biomass and lipid yield. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Early studies have shown that biofuels in powder form burn like a gas. In addition, they are less pollutants and renewable source. In this study, powder biofuel is investigated as a direct solid fuel in internal combustion engine. The biofuel is applied in a cylindrical shape and micron-size, with length between 75–5800 μm and diameter 30–1380 μm. Several mathematical models were investigated including different stages of biomass powder combustion in the engine. The mathematical models include drying, shrinkage, and volatilization processes. The modelling tools also investigated the movement of the fuel powder in the cylinder upon injection, how it is distributed, and its performance before combustion. The proposed models are simulated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools and validated against experiments. The results showed that all models can represent the biomass powder combustion reasonably. However, some models are least expensive in calculations and time. Results also displayed that the powder are traced in different groups based on sizes and flow responses and that takes about 0.2 s. The biomass powder gasification is completed at temperature 1050 K and extra temperature has no meaning. © 2021 THE AUTHOR

AB  - Among alternative transport fuels, biodiesel is an eco-friendly substitute for petrodiesel. The quality of biodiesel is dependent on the composition of feedstock oils used for its preparation. The mathematical/statistical tools are used to determine the biodiesel properties, and their outputs are further compared with experimental results for their consistency and reliability. To reduce the cost, efforts and resources, the current study aims to evaluate the predicting ability of the standalone software BiodieselAnalyzer. In the present study, properties of 45 biodiesels are predicted using BiodieselAnalyzer software and the obtained results are compared with earlier published literature. The % absolute relative deviation was found as 4.47% and 5.31% for density and higher heating value, respectively, but the highest deviation was found for kinematic viscosity (70.19%), oxidation stability (131.19%), cloud point (118.57%) and cold filter plugging point (234.17%). The results indicate that the software shows a good performance in predicting the density and higher heating value; however, the software shows poor reliability in predicting kinematic viscosity, oxidation stability, cloud point and cold filter plugging point. This inconsistency might be due to the non-inclusion of factors such as minor oil components, natural antioxidant in oil, oil extraction process, storage conditions of oil, impurities in oil, production processes, oil and biodiesel clean-up process. Based on this work, it is recommended to improve/develop the software in terms of accuracy and precision for predicting the biodiesel properties or adopt experimentation to determine biofuel properties. © 2021, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.

AB  - In the automotive sector, price of petroleum products and its increasing demand needs a substitute to meet the energy requirements. Due to fuel lean operation, direct injection diesel engines are commonly used, when compared to spark ignition engine. For DI diesel engine, commercial fuel (diesel) is the major fuel source. However, the demand of petroleum based fuel increases one side and on other side there is rapid depletion of fossil fuels. Extensive research are being made to pursuit for an alternate fuel to avoid fossil fuel dependence. Biofuels are manufactured from both edible (sunflower, palm & peanut oil) and non-edible (jatropha oil, mahua oil, pongamia oil) feedstocks. The motivation of this work is to investigate the performance of biofuel from mahua seed oil and waste plastic oil on diesel engine. The advantage of non -edible biofuels compared to edible biofuels is that it doesn’t compete with the foodstuff and freely available in forest. Energy recovery from waste plastics reduces the pollution and encouraging technique for waste management. The amount of hydrocarbon is rich in plastics which produce high calorific oil which can be used as a fuel with some additives. The literature study concludes that plastic oil derived from waste plastic as an alternate liquid fuel for diesel engine is probable. © 2021, International Journal of Renewable Energy Research.

AB  - Currently, the world is facing an energy crisis due to an increase in the global energy demand and this has led to an increased dependence on fossil fuels for energy generation and transportation. The steady rise in the world population which is more than seven billion currently is met with an increase in fossil fuel consumption thereby increasing the threat of fossil depletion and an apparent energy deficit. Fossil fuel emissions pose a threat to the environment and the general human population due to risks posed by greenhouse gases they produce. Biodiesel is recognized as a suitable alternative to fossil fuels due to its biodegradable, renewable and environmentally friendly nature. Biodiesel sources are classified into first, second and third generation based on their origin and type of feedstocks used. There are fourth-generation feedstocks which are biologically man-made resources that are currently at the embryotic stage of research. This paper reviews the sustainability of using Jatropha curcas seeds and microalgae for the production of biodiesel. It highlights an evaluation of the oil yield, composition and performance of the biodiesel derived from both sources whilst assessing the viability of individual feedstocks in biodiesel production. Additionally, different methods of biodiesel production are also assessed. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In this study, the characteristics of bio-oil samples produced through slow pyrolysis of two different macroalgae, i.e. Azolla filiculoides and Ulva fasciata, at optimized conditions were determined and compared. METHODS: For this purpose, the effects of temperature (300-500 °C), carrier gas flow rate (0.2-0.8 L/min), and heating rate (10-20 °C/min) on the final bio-oil production were optimized using response surface methodology established by a central composite design. FINDINGS: The highest bio-oil yield from U. fasciata (34.29%) was obtained at the temperature of 500 °C, nitrogen flow rate of 0.2 L/min, and heating rate of 10 °C/min. As for A. filiculoides feedstock, the highest bio-oil yield (30.83%) was achieved at the temperature of 461 °C, nitrogen flow rate of 0.5 L/min, and heating rate of 20 °C/min. Both bio-oil samples contained saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons. However, the average hydrocarbon chain length was relatively shorter in U. fasciata bio-oil (C4-C16) than in bio-oil from A. filiculoides (C6-C24). Although both bio-oils had almost identical heating values, the U. fasciata bio-oil showed more appropriate properties, i.e. lower viscosity and density. Furthermore, the energy recovery from U. fasciata pyrolysis was calculated as 56.6% which was almost 1.5 times higher than the energy recovery from A. filiculoides pyrolysis. CONCLUSION: The results indicated that U. fasciata bio-oil, with its superior characteristics, could be proposed as a promising candidate for application in diesel-based automotive industries. ©2021 GJESM.

AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the potential of Venturi in the synthesis of biodiesel from residual edible oil in a methyl route. For this purpose, an experimental apparatus consisting of a 5.2 L tank and a Venturi device designed to produce the cavitation phenomenon was constructed in laboratory scale. Biodiesel production was evaluated at three different Venturi inlet pressures: 4.4; 2.9; and 1.4 bar. Methyl esters contents were determined by gas chromatography. Biodiesel synthesis time with the Venturi device was 23.2 seconds (or 4.5 seconds per liter of biodiesel produced), which is equivalent to a single cycle of the system at maximum pressure (4.4 bar). In this condition, the yield of the ester contents was greater than 98%. There is no other case of synthesis as fast as that found in this work. The biodiesel characterization showed that the parameters kinematic viscosity, acidity index, cold clogging point, and specific mass are within the limits established by National Agency of Petroleum Natural Gas and Biofuels (Agência Nacional de Petróleo). The use of Venturi, as a cavitation device, was shown to be more efficient in biodiesel synthesis than other devices, such as orifice plates. © 2021 Associação Brasileira de Engenharia Sanitária e Ambiental.

AB  - Biodiesel is a renewable, clean-burning diesel replacement that can be used in existing diesel engines without modification. Biodiesel is among the nation’s first domestically developed and economically usable advanced biofuels. Throughout the field of biodiesel including FAME/FAGE diesel variants, the concentrations of close to around 20% conform to every requirement out from the existing fuel content guidelines. Larger blending ratios are essential for hydrotreated vegetable oil blends to lubricity enhancers. Of organic biobutanol blends, the suggested blending ratio is restricted to 10% or less to prevent high water content and low cetane content. Here, the presented survey intends to make a review of 65 papers that concerns with biodiesel blends. Accordingly, systematic analyses of the adopted techniques are carried out and presented briefly. In addition, the performances and related maximum achievements of each contribution are also portrayed in this survey. Moreover, the chronological assessment and various blends of biodiesel in the considered papers are reviewed in this work. Finally, the survey portrays numerous research problems and weaknesses that may be helpful for researchers to introduce prospective studies on biodiesel blends. © 2021, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.

AB  - In today’s world, energy security emerged as a decisive challenge among developing economies of the world, India is one such country. Importing the colossal amount of oil to fulfill daily oil demand, uncertainty in the fuel prices, and continuous degradation of air quality thwarts the nation’s economy. To make it less severe, biofuels are observed to be promising alternatives that can overcome the issues of oil import and emission drawbacks. Biofuels seem to be an alternative to conventional fuels due to the advantage of having reduced emissions and better air quality. This paper presents an experimental investigation of biofuels Ethanol and n-Butanol in a Multipoint Fuel Injection (MPFI) Gasoline Engine. It involves the testing of different biofuel blends in a four-cylinder petrol engine to obtain the best biofuel proportion in terms of performance and emission. The analysis of the results shows that the use of biofuel blend in gasoline significantly improves the performance of an engine for ethanol blend of E5 and E10 and the n-butanol blend of B10. Further, there is a considerable decrease in emission parameters for the E5 and B10 blend of biofuel compared with all other tested blends. © 2021, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - The synthesis and characterization of Ni/mesoporous silica (Ni/MS) catalysts from Lapindo mud with various met-Al loading for the hydrocracking of waste cooking oil into biofuel has been conducted. The MS was synthesized by the hydrothermal method using CTAB as a template. The nickel-metal of 4, 6, and 8 wt% was loaded into the MS using salt precursors of Ni(NO3)2.6H2O via wet impregnation, produced the Ni(4)/MS, Ni(6)/MS, and Ni(8)/MS cat-Alysts, respectively. The materials produced were then characterized by X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRD), Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), and Surface Area Analyzer (SAA), and Absorption Atomic Spectropho-Tometry (AAS). The catalytic activity test was carried out for hydrocracking of waste cooking oil and the resulted liquid product was analyzed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). The results showed that the specific surface area of Ni(4)/MS, Ni(6)/MS, and Ni(8)/MS catalysts are 63.08, 91.45, and 120.45 m2/g, respectively. The liquid products of the hydrocracking using Ni(4)/MS, Ni(6)/MS, and Ni(8)/MS catalysts were 80.57, 74.63, and 75.77 wt%, where the total biofuel produced was 55.46, 50.93, and 54.05 wt%, respectively. Based on these results, Ni(4)/MS material was successfully used as the most potent catalyst in the hydrocracking of waste cooking oil into the biofuel.

AB  - In recent decades, public policies have been developed to encourage the use of biofuels in Brazil, such as the establishment of a minimum mandatory content of biodiesel to commercialized diesel. In order to avoid adulterations in the composition of this blend established by law, a strict quality control is necessary throughout the entire production and distribution chain. In this perspective, researches can be promoted in order to develop methodologies that could provide fast and reliable answers for the qualitative control of this binary mixture. In this work, a model was proposed in order to classify the content of methyl biodiesel of macaúba in the mixture with diesel, using a combination of analytical / chemometric techniques of medium infrared spectroscopy (MIR) and Discriminant Analysis by Partial Least Squares (PLS-DA). This combination of techniques allowed a quickly and efficiently way to classify the samples of B10 and BX from the biodiesel / diesel mixture, offering the possibility of minimize the use of solvents and reagents. The mean quadratic errors obtained were low, with percentages within the reproducibility of the standardized method. The performance criteria obtained for the developed model, such as sensitivity, specificity, precision and efficiency, were equal to 100 %. The good performance obtained in this study, indicates that this kind of methodology is viable, and could be used by the inspection agencies in the quality control the of this fuel. © 2021 Sociedade Brasileira de Quimica.

AB  - The dynamic development of transport in recent decades reflects the level of economic development in the world. The transport sector today is one of the main barriers to the achievement of the European Union's climate protection objectives. More and more restrictive legal regulations define permissible emission limits for the amounts of toxic substances emitted into the atmosphere. Numerical CO2modeling tools are one way to replace costly on-road testing. Driving cycles, which are an approximation of the vehicle's on-road operating conditions, are the basis of any vehicle approval procedure. The paper presents a computer tool that uses neural networks to simulate driving tests. Data obtained from tests on the Mercedes E350 chassis dynamometer were used for the construction of the neural model. All the collected operational parameters of the vehicle, which are the input data for the built model, were used to create simulation control runs for driving tests: Environmental Protection Agency, Supplemental Federal Test Procedure, Highway Fuel Economy Driving Schedule, Federal Test Procedure, New European Driving Cycle, Random Cycle Low, Random Cycle High, Mobile Air Conditioning Test Procedure, Common Artemis Driving Cycles, Worldwide Harmonized Light-Duty Vehicle Test Procedure. Using the developed computer simulation tool, the impact on CO2emissions was analyzed in the context of driving tests of four types of fuels: Diesel, Fatty Acid Methyl Esters, rapeseed oil, butanol (butyl alcohol). As a result of the processing of this same computer tool, mass consumption of fuels and CO2emissions were analyzed in driving tests for the given analyzed vehicle. © 2021 MDPI AG.

AB  - The present review presents the most commonplace vegetable-based feedstock for biodiesel production. It focuses on biodiesel production with an emphasis on the most recent studies and innovations. Transesterification of plant oil or animal fat is the most common process for the production of biodiesel. Several techniques are utilized for this transesterification reaction, such as batch processes, ultrasonic, microwave and other methods. Many conditions are usually studied, including temperature, pressure, solvent and catalysis. Furthermore, we aim to provide an investigation of the different processes and technologies applicable to the production of second-generation biodiesel, with special attention paid to the development of innovative catalysts as well as new reactor concepts. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) provides a promising route for upgrading biomass-derived fatty acids to alkanes, which are potential biofuels (e.g. jet fuel (C8–C16) and diesel (C12–C22)) that could reduce our reliance on unsustainable fossil fuels. Currently, catalytic HDO, conducted over catalysts such as molybdenum disulfide, necessitates harsh operating conditions (&gt;300 °C) which is both environmentally and economically unsustainable and promotes unwanted side reactions, e.g. cracking, which compromises product selectivity. Accordingly, the development of novel catalysts, which enable efficient and sustainable HDO, under milder operating conditions, and their translation from lab bench to large-scale production are highly desired. This review discusses the recent development of heterogeneous catalysts for HDO (including reaction pathways, mechanisms, and side reactions) and explores design strategies for the development of new multifunctional catalysts with potential to enable future development of HDO processes under mild conditions. In particular, we consider the sequential cascade transformation of fatty acids into fatty alcohols (via hydrodeoxygenation) and then hydrocarbons (via dehydration and hydrogenation), which requires the coupling of different but complementary catalytic sites, as an attractive alternative mild HDO strategy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction is a promising anaerobic thermochemical process for the conversion of wet biomass into an energy dense biocrude. In this study, the suitability of orange peel for biocrude production was investigated. The study was carried out at varying temperatures (200 to 300 °C), reaction time (20 to 60 min), and total solids loading (15 to 25%). The optimum operating conditions for recovering maximum biofuel from biomass (28.4 wt%) were found to be 275 °C temperature, 40-min reaction time, and 25% total solids loading. The Box-Behnken design of response surface methodology was used to examine the effect of reaction parameters on biocrude yield and its byproducts and resulted the temperature to be the most effective followed by reaction time and total solids loading. The heating value of biocrude was 32 MJ/kg with flash point of about 93 °C. The obtained biocrude had comparable fuel properties with those of diesel and bio-diesel standards. The GC-MS and FTIR analyses proved biocrude as a complex mixture of alkanes, alkenes, aliphatic and aromatic acids, and alcohols and aqueous phase byproduct as a rich chemical source consisting of esters, alcohols, and ketones which provides a futuristic approach to drop in advanced fuels and chemicals from biocrude. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Liquid biofuels for compression ignition engines are often based on vegetable oils. In order to be used in compression ignition engine, the vegetable oils have to be processed due to their high viscosity or it is also possible to use vegetable oils in fuel blends. To decrease the viscosity of the fuel blends containing crude vegetable oil the alcohol-based fuel, admixtures can be used. The effect of rapeseed oil–diesel fuel–n-butanol blends on combustion characteristics and solid particles production of turbocharged compression ignition engine was investigated. The 10% and 20% concentrations of n-butanol in the fuel blend were measured and evaluated. The engine Zetor 1204, located in tractor Zetor Forterra 8641 with the power of 60kW and direct injection was used for the measurement. The engine was loaded through power take off shaft of the tractor using mobile dynamometer MAHA ZW500. The measurement was performed in stabilized conditions at 20%, 60%, and 100% engine load. The engine speed was kept at 1950 rpm. Tested fuel blends demonstrated lower production of solid particles than diesel fuel and lower peak cylinder pressure and with increasing concentration of n-butanol in the fuel blend, the ignition delay was prolonged and premixed phase of combustion was increased.

AB  - Invading microorganisms can hinder productivity of biofuel algae cultures. We utilise allelochemical gramine as a model to better understand allelopathic effects against Chlorella sorokiniana and invasive alga Coelastrella sp. Coelastrella itself inhibits C. sorokiniana via allelopathy. Both algae were exposed to 0, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 mg gramine L−1 (n = 8) in wellplates at 18, 25 and 32°C to observe temperature effects on gramine’s allelopathic influence. We also grew C. sorokiniana in 500 mL flasks (n = 3) in 0, 4, 8 and 16 mg gramine L−1 at 25°C to obtain enough biomass to measure fatty acid content. Growth was estimated by measuring optical density at 750 nm and fatty acid content of flask-grown algae via high-lipid performance chromatography (HLPC) after 30 days. Gramine impacted both algae species most strongly, even at low gramine dosages, when grown under sub-optimal temperatures (18 and 32°C). At 25°C, only the highest gramine concentration showed a significant reduction in C. sorokiniana growth compared to other treatments. Gramine concentrations above 16 mg L−1 significantly impacted Coelastrella. Gramine effected algae growth over only a few days. Low concentrations of gramine (&lt;16 mg L−1) were not effective stressors to increase lipid accumulation. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Aim of this study is to evaluate the potential of a rational utilization of wood and bark of the invasive species of tree-of-heaven (Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) Swingle), through their thorough chemical characterization. Extractives, celluloses, hemicelluloses, lignin, and ash contents of wood and bark material of different tree sections were examined, using wet chemical analyses/extractions. The horizontal variability of the chemical composition of the stems from pith to cambium was investigated, as well as the differences between early- and late-wood, different annual rings, sapwood and heartwood, and differences between wood and bark. The material’s equilibrium moisture content, density, pH, colour, and calorific value were also determined. Bark material presented higher extractives, slightly higher lignin, much higher ash, and slightly lower holocellulose content than wood. As the tree-age increases, the wood and bark present lower lignin, but a linear increase of holocellulose and extractives. The heartwood demonstrated more extractives, lignin and ash, and less holocellulose than sapwood. Very low ash contents and high calorific values constitute features highly crucial for its utilization in solid biofuel production. The optimum harvesting time for the highest possible utilization of extractives and holocellulose is after the 21st year, while for lignin after the 5th year. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The biochars obtained from the pyrolysis of biomass at different conditions have the potential to be used as biofuels. Thus, as a critical fuel property, the higher heating value (HHV) of biochars must be determined to decide on their application area. However, oxygen bomb calorimeters that are employed for HHV determination are expensive. Also, analysis is time-consuming, needs specialists, and can suffer from experimental errors. Although some model equations are available for solid fuels (biomass, coal, etc.) to calculate HHV, biochar has different properties, and a new model is required. This study aims to form an artificial neural network (ANN) model in order to estimate HHV of biochars by using simple proximate analysis data of 129 different biochars. The experimental and the predicted model results showed good agreement that the ANN model presented the highest regression coefficient of 0.9651 and the lowest mean absolute deviation of 0.5569 among all models previously reported in the literature. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The catalytic conversion of palm oil was carried out over four zeolite catalysts—Y, ZSM-5, Y-ZSM-5 hybrid, and Y/ZSM-5 composite—to produce jet biofuel with high amount of alkanes and low amount of aromatic hydrocarbons. The zeolite Y-ZSM-5 hybrid catalyst was synthesized using crystalline zeolite Y as the seed for the growth of zeolite ZSM-5. Synthesized zeolite catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, and temperature programmed desorption of ammonia, while the chemical compositions of the jet biofuel were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The conversion of palm oil over zeolite Y resulted in the highest yield (42 wt%) of jet biofuel: a high selectivity of jet range alkanes (51%) and a low selectivity of jet range aromatic hydrocarbons (25%). Zeolite Y-ZSM-5 hybrid catalyst produced a decreased percentage of jet range alkane (30%) and a significant increase in the selectivity of aromatic hydrocarbons (57%). The highest conversion of palm oil to hydrocarbon compounds was achieved by zeolite Y-ZSM-5 hybrid catalyst (99%), followed by zeolite Y/ZSM-5 composite (96%), zeolite Y (91%), and zeolite ZSM-5 (74%). The reaction routes for converting palm oil to jet biofuel involve deoxygenation of fatty acids into C15–C18 alkanes via decarboxylation and decarbonylation, catalytic cracking into C8–C14 alkanes, and cycloalkanes as well as aromatization into aromatic hydrocarbon. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Biodiesel is a kind of biofuels that can be mixed with diesel and used as fuel. Selecting cheap and available feedstock is a prominent step in producing biodiesel economically. This paper presents the pros and cons of biodiesel and its production methods. The diesel demand is significantly high in Iran, especially in the transportation sector; On the other hand, the amount of produced waste is significant in chicken slaughterhouses. Considering this type of feedstock as a source to produce biodiesel not only can reduce the associated environmental problems, but also can supply some of the diesel needs. Hence, this paper also estimates biodiesel production potential from poultry slaughter waste and its cost. Based on the results, 736 kilotonnes of poultry slaughter waste is produced annually in Iran, which can be used as feedstock to produce 112 million liters of biodiesel by transesterification process with the production cost of around 14,277 rial/liter; i.e. 30% of diesel demand in the transportation sector can be supplied by B2 (98% diesel and 2% biodiesel) or diesel demand growth in this sector converted to B20 to increase economical and environmental sustainability. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Turmeric leaves are waste products after removing turmeric rhizome. In the present work, the oil was extracted from the leaves of curcuma longa by hydro distillation method. The extracted oil was studied for preliminary physicochemical and phytochemical tests. The phytochemical evaluation of the turmeric leaf oil indicates the presence of terpenes which was used to run two stroke and four stroke engines. Engine emits less harmful product with turmeric oil as compared to petrol. Hence, it has been concluded that the turmeric leaf oil can be used as an alternative biofuel for petrol. Theoretically, turmeric leaf oil properties are similar to that of petrol. By performing practical experiments on this oil using different types of piston head shapes and varying parameters, we came to know that this will fulfil all capabilities as a biofuel in IC engines. In the second part, the characteristics fuel properties of turmeric leaf oil and their blends with petrol in the proportion of 40:60 (B40) have been studied. In the third part, engine tests have been conducted on turmeric leaf oil blends with petrol oil and brake thermal efficiency, engine gas temperature and air fuel ratio were evaluated. The next part consists of exhaust emission tests such as CO and HC emission measurement with a five gas analyser. © 2021. MechAero Foundation for Technical Research & Education Excellence.

AB  - The national biofuel policy of the Indian government support to put a great emphasis on the synthesis of biodiesel from the nonedible feedstock. A potential option in this regard is Neem oil which is found in abundance in India (~1,00,000 tonnes). The major hindrance to the commercialization of biodiesel is its shelf life due to poor oxidation and stability characteristics. The current work investigates the oxidation stability of Neem biodiesel as per EU standard (EN14214) using the Rancimat apparatus. The oxidation stability of 12.3 hours without doping any chemical antioxidant in the synthesized Neem biodiesel makes it highly suitable for commercial acceptance. The impact of pyrogallol (PY) antioxidant was also investigated on the shelf life of Neem biodiesel build on response surface methodology (RSM) in accordance with Box-Behnken Design (BBD). Moreover, the execution and excretion characteristic of the Neem biodiesel blends: B15, B25, B35, and B45 are investigated on direct injection automotive compression ignition engine. Based on this broad experimental investigation B15 blend can be used as a fuel to power the existing automotive compression ignition engine with no compromise in the execution and excretion characteristics of the engine. From the analysis of the data of life-cycle assessment of the Neem biodiesel, it was found that it possesses the global warming potential of 45.72gCO2-eq Functional Unit−1 which is six times lesser than mineral diesel. Moreover, the Neem plantation has a carbon dioxide isolation potential of around 10 t ha−1 year −1. All these factors make the Neem Biodiesel highly suitable for blending with mineral diesel to power the existing compression ignition engines. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The rapidly growing energy demand across the globe and emission problem can be compensated by biodiesel blends. These promising renewable fuels can be developed from vegetable feedstock. The influences of biodiesel blend (B10) derived from inedible vegetable oil were explored on combustion as well as performance along with emission parameters at different percentage of loading conditions in a normally aspirated with liquid cooled, single-cylinder, direct-injection compression ignition (CI) engine. A combined method of acid catalyst esterification followed by alkali catalyst transesterification is used to prepare biodiesel. Using conventional procedures the important properties of biodiesel have been tested for its important requirement as engine fuel. A compression ignition, single-zone biodiesel engine model has been established based on engine geometries (stroke, cylinder diameter, con rod length, and diameter of crank). Deviation in specific heat ratio of engine cylinder charge and burnt gases has been established. The predicted model for biodiesel blend engine has been verified using diesel and biodiesel blends B10. The event of reduced cylinder peak pressure and poor engine performance along with slight reduction in NOx emission while fuelled with NOME and WVOME blend (B10) are examined in this study. NOME B10 is preferred over WVOME B10 as an alternative to petroleum diesel. In order to find out the performance results and combustion nature, constant engine speed (1500 rpm) is being maintained during the experiments under 0%, 25%, 50%, and 100% load condition. © 2021 by Begell House, Inc.

AB  - Rubber seed oil (RSO), derived from the seeds of Hevea brasiliensis, is an exciting alternative with great potential for use in biodiesel production. Furthermore, it can be injected directly into an internal combustion engine, blended with diesel derived from fossil fuels. The present work deals with the potential estimation of waste cooking oil (WCO) bio diesel and RSO biodiesel, characterization of biodiesel, performance and exhaust analysis of biodiesel blends in DI diesel engine. The best results in terms of performance and emission are obtained for B10 blend which resulted in highest brake thermal efficiency of 19.2 % at 80% loading. The NOx emissions are maximum for B20 blend. © 2021. MechAero Foundation for Technical Research & Education Excellence.

AB  - This study investigates the influences of light-dark cycles and NaNO3 dose on Chlorella kessleri microalgal-specific growth rate (SGR), biomass productivity (P), and intracellular lipid productivity (LP) by using central composite design with desirability function. A single-objective optimization showed that the maximum SGR, P, and LP can be achieved as 0.487 day−1, 58.718 g/L day−1, and 14.252 mg/L day−1, respectively. The corresponding optimized light-dark cycle and NaNO3 loading were determined as 11.6/8.4 (h/h) and 15.54 g/L, 12/12 (h/h) and 16.23 g/L, and 12/12 (h/h) and 6.63 g/L, respectively. The multi-response optimization showed that the highest SGR of 0.359 day−1, biomass productivity of 50.663 g/L day−1 and LP of 14.114 mg/L day−1 can be accomplished at culture environments of 12/12 (h/h) light-dark cycles and 10.38 g/L NaNO3. These results suggest that the central composite design with desirability function-based technique is useful for design and operation of photobioreactors to produce lipid from microalgae. Analysis of variance was employed to explore the significance of the factors affecting microalgal growth as well as biomass and lipid productivities. The predicted optimized culture conditions were experimentally confirmed (error &lt; 6%) indicating the process is robust and reliable. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Jatropha is considered as one of the most promising potential oil sources for biodiesel production and other industrial applications. However, research on the potential of Jatropha seed oil is mainly focused on Jatropha curcas, with other species receiving little attention. The physicochemical properties of J. podagrica seed oil was studied to determine its potential as feedstock for biodiesel production and other industrial applications in Thailand. The seed oil was extracted with n-hexane from milled kernels using the soxhlet extractor and subsequently characterised for free fatty acids, iodine value, viscosity, saponification value, density, and acid value. The fatty acid profile of the seed oil was also analysed using gas chromatography (GC). Analysis of the physical properties of the J. podagrica seed kernel showed lower average physical characteristics when compared to those of J. curcas seed kernel. J. podagrica seeds had high oil content comparable to J. curcas oil content. The main fatty acid components of the seed oil were oleic acid (15%) and linoleic acid (70%). Generally, the results of the physicochemical analysis indicated that J. podagrica seed oil would be very useful for the production of soap and shampoo in Thailand. To produce biodiesel from the seed oil, a two-step acid-catalysed transesterification process would be appropriate. © 2021 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia. All rights reserved.

AB  - A high-oil candlenut (Aleurites moluccana)-derived biodiesel was purified using new generation solvents called Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) and physicochemical properties of the purified biodiesel were assessed according to the accepted international standards for biodiesel (ASTM D6751; EN 14214). Binary and ternary choline chloride-based DESs containing glycerol and ethylene glycol as hydrogen bond donors were synthesized. The results of the investigation showed that the quality of DESs-purified biodiesel generally improved compared with the unpurified biodiesel and fulfilled the accepted standard limits for biodiesel except carbon residue and oxidation stability properties. Choline chloride/ethylene glycol (ChCl/ Eg, 1:2 molar ratio) having a DES/biodiesel ratio of 1:1 (DES2-11) has enhanced the Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME) content of unpurified biodiesel from 81.89% to 98.13%, and the oxidation stability from 2.36 h to 3.06 h. 1H NMR examination showed the successful synthesis of DESs; GC-MS analysis of candlenut oil and its biodiesel revealed oil and fatty acid methyl ester compositions, respectively. The similarity in FAME compositions between DESs-purified and unpurified biodiesel as revealed through GC-MS examination suggests the selective removal of impurities and the efficiency of DESs in improving the quality of candlenut-derived biodiesel. © 2021 by Japan Oil Chemists’ Society.

AB  - Synthesis of 1,3- dioxane and 1,3-dioxolane, using sulfated CeO2–ZrO2 catalyst for acetalization of glycerol with benzaldehyde, is the focus of present work. SO42-/CeO2–ZrO2 catalyst was synthesized using combustion method. Experiments were carried out to analyze the effect of various solvents (n-hexane, toluene, tert-butyl alcohol, pentanol), molar ratios (1:3, 1:5, 1:7), catalyst loadings (3 wt%, 5 wt%, 9 wt %) and temperatures (80 °C, 90 °C, 100 °C) on glycerol conversion and selectivity of the products. Selectivity of 87.20% dioxolane and 12.80% dioxane was obtained at molar ratio of 1:3, 9 wt% catalyst loading and temperature of 100 °C.Strong NH3 desorption peak from NH3-TPD study indicated the high acidic strength of sulphated catalyst. Strong surface acidity and surface porosity (observed from TEM and SEM analysis) contributed to an enhanced activity of the catalyst for glycerol acetalization reaction. The kinetics of the reaction was studied using an elementary kinetic law. A correlation coefficient of 0.98 from the selected kinetic model proved that the rate of acetalization reaction was dependent on glycerol concentration and acetal formation was instantaneous. The study demonstrated the application of an environmentally benign, inexpensive, thermally stable, active SO42-/CeO2–ZrO2 catalyst for glycerol acetalization reaction to synthesize 1,3-dioxolane as the desired product. © 2021

AB  - During the poultry industrialization process the so-called sludge oil, a residual chicken fat, is recovered in the wastewater treatment plant and its use presents potential as raw material for biodiesel production. Thus, the aim of the study was to prepare blends of sludge oil with soybean oil to obtain fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) through the homogeneous alkaline transesterification reaction. To perform this study, a simple pre-treatment process–heating and subsequent filtration–was used, allowing sludge oil to be mixed with soybean oil to compose blends, without the need to use more sophisticated pre-treatment processes. After this step, blends ranging from 5% to 90% (m/m) of sludge oil mixed with soybean oil were prepared. The results showed that the molar ratio (1:6 oil blend:methanol), catalyst concentration 0.5% NaOH (mcat/moil), at 65 °C for 60 min yielded FAME above 99.0 and 90.0% (m/m) for blends with up to 5 and 15% sludge oil, respectively. By increasing the temperature to 70 °C, under the same selected parameters, the blend with 10% sludge oil provided yield above 99.0% (m/m), presenting appropriate physicochemical properties, within the parameters required by National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP). These findings show the great potential sludge oil provides to reduce Brazil’s dependency on soybean oil for biodiesel production. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Carbon trading is a market-based mechanism for controlling carbon emissions by providing economic incentives to reduce emissions. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in modeling supply chain networks under this scheme; however, to date, only a limited number of researchers have investigated the implication of this mechanism for biofuel supply chains. The optimization model presented in this paper examines a trade-off between the cost of trading carbon credits and costs associated with outsourcing of the biomass pretreatment process when carbon emissions exceed the predetermined carbon cap in a biofuel supply chain. To demonstrate the applicability of the model, we analyzed challenges in supplying different sources of biomass to two biorefinery plants and shipping the produced biofuels to multiple demand zones. The results showed that carbon emission reductions have a relatively nonlinear pattern when the carbon credit price increases linearly. Furthermore, we presented significant managerial and policy insights on the impact of different carbon emission caps on total costs and total emissions. Moreover, we analyzed the cost adjustment between trading carbon credits and outsourcing decisions for different carbon cap settings. This paper ends with suggestions for further development of the presented model for future researches. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Liquid biofuels have emerged as a worldwide alternative fuel with potential to replace fossil fuels. Due to their wide availability as derivatives of organic materials from plants, they have attracted much attention and investment in developing countries including Tanzania, as alternative sources of energy. This study examined effects of oil quality from stem barks and phylloclades of Euphorbia tirucalli trees of different girth sizes (viz., 20 cm, 30 cm, 40 cm, 50 cm, 60 cm, 70 cm, and 80 cm) from semi-arid, coastal, and southern highlands in Dodoma, Dar es Salaam, and Mbeya Southern highland, agro-ecological zones in Tanzania. Using Soxhlet extraction method, oils were extracted from E. tirucalli stem barks with different girth sizes while oils from phylloclades were extracted from matured apical phylloclades collected from shoots of E. tirucalli trees from which the stem bark samples had been collected. Oil yields were determined by measuring the weight of oil (g) by the total weight of sample extracts used (20 g), and the average oil yield on each sample was determined. Oil quality was evaluated as oxidative stability index (OSI), acid values (AVs), and percent free fatty acids (%FFAs). Their results were then compared with the European Union (EU) oil quality standard specifications prescribed in EN 14214 of 6 h, 0.5 mg KOH/g, max and 0.020 maximum wt% limits, respectively. Differences in the quality of E. tirucalli (stem bark and phylloclades) oil were analyzed statistically with paired-sample t test (two-tailed) using the SPSS 15.0 software package. Results showed that the difference in OSIs from stem barks were not significantly higher (3–5 h) than phylloclades (3–4 h) at the p > 0.5 level. Also, the difference in AVs and %FFAs from the stem barks (7.6–7.4 mg KOH and 3.8–3.6%) was not significantly lower than those from the phylloclades (8.4–8.1 mg KOH and 4.3–4.0%) respectively. The quality of oil from stem bark and phylloclades samples at different stem girth sizes semi-arid agro-ecological zone was not significantly higher than from southern highland and coastal agro-ecological zones, respectively. Thus, there were no significant differences in the quality of E. tirucalli oil (stem bark and phylloclades) among stem girth sizes in different agro-ecological zones. The AVs and %FFAs of oils from stem bark and phylloclades were higher than the recommended standards, while the OSIs were below the biofuel standard limit. High AVs and %FFAs reduced oil quality by producing considerably low OSIs values than recommended standards. Finally, the study concluded that E. tirucalli oil requires purification to reduce levels of AV and %FFA contents so that the oil becomes suitable for application as liquid biofuel for energy generations. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The cost of biodiesel production and the requirement of raw ingredients are the primary constraints that need to be addressed while searching for viable alternative fuels to petrol and diesel. Oleaginous yeasts are gaining wider acceptance as biofuel candidates among oil-rich crops/microbes. The present investigation aimed to integrate the agro-industrial wastewater stream as a nutrient source for the cultivation of oleaginous yeast and to use the resultant biomass and lipid as a feedstock for biofuel synthesis. The yeast biomass grown in sago processing wastewater contained 7.21% moisture content, 69.01% volatile matter, 12.61% fixed carbon, and 11.16% ash content. The ultimate analysis determined the contents of carbon (40.43%), nitrogen (5.14%), hydrogen (4.62%), sulfur (0.54%), and oxygen (49.27%). The heating value of yeast biomass was 16.54 MJ kg−1. The thermal behavior of yeast biomass also suggests its potential use as an energy source. The FTIR spectrum of biomass had major lipid (3030–2800 cm−1 and 1500–1350 cm−1) and carbohydrate (1250 cm−1 and 1000 cm−1) functional peaks. Further FAME profiling revealed that the yeast biomass is primarily composed of stearic, oleic, linoleic, and linolenic acids, similar to the vegetable oils. The fuel characteristics of yeast biodiesel (SV, 168.87 mg KOH g−1; IV, 120 mg I2 100 g−1; CN, 61.79; and KV, 3.16 mm2 s−1) are also within the ASTM standard limits, suggesting that yeast biomass could be a sustainable and economically viable feedstock for both solid and liquid biofuel production. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The aim of the study was to produce biodiesel from animal oil as non-edible feedstock. Three different concentrations of oils were used to produce the biodiesel. The main characteristic of these oils was high-free fatty acid content. The oils were transesterified with acid and basic catalysts, respectively. Biodiesel yield of 90 wt.% was obtained by acid transesterification (9 wt.% HCl, 6:1 methanol: oil molar ratio, 60°C, 46 h). Pre-esterification conditions were studied using different oils and acid catalysts: 0.6 wt.% HCl, 6:1 methanol: oil molar ratio at 60°C for 4 h, and this resulted in oil with an acid value of less than 0.8%. Under similar transesterification conditions, alkali transesterification of esterified fats resulted in the yield of 97.2 wt.% esters. Biodiesel properties were determined and most of the properties were within EN 14214 and ASTM D6751. Biodiesel from animal fats is less stable for oxidation and this is due to the absence of natural antioxidants as compared to the biodiesel of vegetable origin. For this reason, biodiesel produced from animal fats might not be adequate to use at 100% pure in vehicles during cold weather. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - First (1G), second (2G) and third-generation (3G) ethanol industrialisation produces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increases carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere. In this study, a life cycle assessment (LCA) concluded that hydrolysis and filtration processes have the largest environmental impact, and despite a trend of increased discharge generated by electricity related to 3G introduction, thermodynamic processes still show the highest emissions. These results demonstrate the importance of developing a strong technology base in biofuel industrialisation, predominantly due to the vast potential of 3G production, which increasingly requires higher energy consumption and more efficiency from the industrial system. As such, the aim of this paper is to assess the environmental impact caused by CO2 emissions in 1G, 2G and 3G ethanol production. © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Large quantities of waste cooking oils (WCO) are generated annually, as a result of food preparation, which can cause contamination of waters and soils, if they are not disposed of properly, but in turn have great potential in the production of biodiesel. In this work, the WCO collected from fast food establishments were subjected to an esterification pretreatment, varying the reaction conditions, molar ratio, catalyst concentration and time, to decrease the content of free fatty acids generated in the frying processes; after an alkaline transesterification. The initial acidity of the WCO (10,08 ± 0,22 %) was found to drop below 1 % during esterification at 60 °C and 100 rpm, with RMAVU:MeOH of 1: 7 and HCl concentration of 0.3 %v/v, with a conversion of free fatty acids (FFA) to methyl esters of 94.48 and 98.61 % for reaction times of 4 and 6 hours, respectively. The previously esterified WCO were subjected to a transesterification process with KOH as a catalyst in the presence of methanol, at 60 °C and 100 rpm, finding that the biodiesel produced was a mixture composed of the methyl esters of linoleic acids (57 %), palmitic (14 %), oleic (22 %), stearic (4 %) and elaidic (3 %). The highest concentration of methyl esters (93,797 ± 0.685 g.L-1) was obtained when using the esterified AVU during 6 hours of reaction. FTIR spectra confirmed the conversion of fatty acids to methyl esters, so this product could be used as a biofuel. © 2021, Universidad del Zulia. All rights reserved.

AB  - A study of the existing literature on the effects of diethyl ether with different biodiesels such as Fish, Neem, Calophyllum Inophyllum, Cottonseed, and Soybean biodiesel was undertaken. Till date, no study related to the combined effects of repurpose used cooking oil biodiesel/diethyl ether/diesel blends and different compression ratios with different loading conditions has been reported in the literature. Moreover, the current study reveals that there are some major flaws in the existing scenario such as no reduction in harmful exhaust gases such as carbon dioxide, hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxide. There is no noticeable improvement in the performance characteristics such as brake thermal efficiency and brake specific fuel consumption. This investigation has been carried out for controlling harmful emissions and improving the performance of the engine. The present study investigates the combined impact of compression ratios on emission and performance characteristics of a diesel engine using ternary blends in comparison with diesel. This study provides eco-friendly working conditions that result in fewer emissions with improved performance. The results show that a higher compression ratio is useful for minimizing nitrogen oxide emission, while a lower compression ratio is useful for minimizing carbon monoxide emission. CR16 works effectively with a higher proportion of diethyl ether (2.4 and 3.2%) and provides better results for minimizing emissions with improved performance. The following eco-friendly blends delivered lower emissions with improved performance. These blends are: A0.8_B19.2: CR16 and CR15; A1.6_B18.4: CR17 and CR16; A2.4_B17.6: CR16, CR15, and CR14; A3.2_B16.8: CR16 and CR15. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Biofuels, such as those derived from woody biomass, are being developed as one part of a renewable energy portfolio; however, it remains unclear if they can be sustainably developed. This manuscript demonstrates that the use of agent-based modeling (ABM) and life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) as part of an integrated methodology allows for robust assessment of the possible impacts. A case study of a proposed biorefinery in Ontonagon, Michigan, USA is conducted. In the case study, ABM is used to project the harvest decision making of forest owners and loggers to determine if they were willing to harvest and supply woody biomass to the biorefinery under several different price points. The results from the ABM were used to inform inventory data for projections of environmental impacts, along with projected impacts for economic and social concerns. The results of the case study show that while Ontonagon is a promising site for a biorefinery, the quantity of woody biomass delivered is a concern along with potential impacts to wetlands in the region. Ultimately, this case study suggestions that the integration of ABM and LCSA may be effective the assessment of other biorefineries. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biofuel as an alternative fuel which in recent years has become the world’s demand for renewable energy fuels and is a major factor underlying the increase in prices of agricultural commodities, especially corn as the main commodity for biofuels in the US. The purpose of this study is to examine the volatility of several world food commodities, namely rice, wheat, corn, and soybeans and to analyze the impact of biofuel development on the price volatility of some world food commodities. This research uses coefficient of variation and volatility analysis with the ARCH GARCH method. Based on the results, the price of food commodities is more volatile after the adoption of the Renewable Fuel Standard 2 (RFS) policy in 2007. The results of the study show that development of biofuels (from corn and soybeans) have a higher level of volatility than the other two commodities (rice and wheat) due to the variance of rice and wheat was lower than corn and soybeans. It means that the greater the relevance of a commodity to the development of biofuels, the higher the price volatility of the commodity. Meanwhile, the expansion of biofuels also made US reduce the amount corn and soybean exports, of course this is what makes the supply of US corn and soybeans decreased and makes the price will increase. © 2021, Econjournals.

AB  - The oil industry needs to reduce CO2 emissions across the entire lifecycle of fossil fuels to meet environmental regulations and societal requirements and to sustain its business. With this goal in mind, this study aims to evaluate the CO2 mitigation potential of several bio-oil co-processing pathways in an oil refinery. Techno-economic analysis was conducted on different pathways and their greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation potentials were compared. Thirteen pathways with different bio-oils, including vegetable oil (VO), fast pyrolysis oil (FPO), hydro-deoxygenated oil (HDO), catalytic pyrolysis oil (CPO), hydrothermal liquefaction oil (HTLO), and Fischer–Tropsch fuels, were analyzed. However, no single pathway could be presented as the best option. This would depend on the criteria used and the target of the co-processing route. The results obtained indicated that up to 15% of the fossil-fuel output in the refinery could be replaced by biofuel without major changes in the core activities of the refinery. The consequent reduction in CO2 emissions varied from 33% to 84% when compared with pure equivalent fossil fuels replaced (i.e., gasoline and diesel). Meanwhile, the production costs varied from 17 to 31€/GJ (i.e., 118–213$/bbleq). Co-processing with VO resulted in the lowest overall performance among the options that were evaluated while co-processing HTLO in the hydrotreatment unit and FPO in the fluid catalytic cracking unit showed the highest potential for CO2 avoidance (69% of refinery CO2 emissions) and reduction in CO2 emissions (84% compared to fossil fuel), respectively. The cost of CO2 emissions avoided for all of the assessed routes was in the range of €99–651 per tCO2. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - The growing interest in oilseed crops for sustainable biofuel production has promoted the exploration of new plant species with high oil content and quality. One of these species is pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.; Brassicaceae), a winter annual plant that, due to the characteristics of its seed oil, has a great potential as feedstock for advanced biofuels. However, pennycress is not cultivated in Europe and, in contrast to the USA, the research has been very scarce, especially regarding its agronomic behaviour and production. In this work we performed a comparative analysis of the agronomic potential of two pennycress accessions of European origin (French and NASC), with respect to two from USA (Beecher and Elizabeth), to be cultivated under Mediterranean agroclimatic conditions. Stand establishment, growth, and yield data of the four pennycress accessions were collected during two growing seasons (2016−17 and 2017−18) in experimental fields situated in Aragon (NE Spain). The European accessions had less germination success than those from USA (20−50 % less). However, the seed yield of the French accession was similar or superior to that of USA origin (730–1390 vs 500−1340 ha−1). This was because French plants were able to compensate for the lower plant density with increased production of tillers and inflorescences. The other European short cycle accession, NASC, requires further research to understand and overcome its erratic germination and low seed yield. In terms of seed oil and erucic acid content, higher variability was found between the growing seasons than among the pennycress accessions, suggesting that weather conditions, especially rainfall distribution, have a pronounced effect on seed, oil and erucic acid yield and must be considered for growing pennycress in Europe. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Diesel engines are playing a vital responsibility in the field of automobile, agriculture, construction, and power generation. In the present world, much research is going on in the field of renewable energy to replace conventional sources of energy. But it is not very easy to replace diesel engines with other sources due to the better power output and reliability. The emissions from CI engines are very harmful for human health and for the environment. The major emissions are smoke and NOx which need to be controlled in an effective manner. In this work, direct injection variable compression ratio CI engine was used in experimental investigations for determining the combustion characteristics for D–MXEE–NM blends at different compression ratios. By performance analysis and exhaust emission of engine at peak load, D–MXEE5–NM2.5 (diesel 92.5%, 2–methoxyethyl ether 5%, and nitromethane 2.5%) blend was identified as best blend among all tested fuel blends and pure diesel at normal compression ratio (17.5). Further, all considered fuels with different CR values at peak load were ranked by Entropy–VIKOR method. From the analysis, D–MXEE5–NM2.5 at CR 19.5 was found as best fuel blend (ranked first) among all fuel blends and different compression ratios considered with same experimental conditions. By comparison of best fuel blend D–MXEE5–NM2.5 (at advanced compression ratio 19.5) with diesel (at standard CR 17.5), emission decline (HC 66.66%, CO 70.00%, and smoke 16.09%) and performance improvement (decrement in BSFC 7.07% and increment in BTE 4.41%) were obtained significantly at peak load. However, negligible increment in NOx (3.58%) was observed. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Liquid biofuels from non-grain energy crops on marginal land could become an important substitute of gasoline in the transport sector, and offer the possibility to reduce competition with food crops for land resources. However, the cultivation of energy crops is facing profound challenges due to changing temperature and precipitation in the future. To assess the impact of climate change on the potential of liquid biofuels on marginal land in China, this study used a geographic information system-based approach combined with multiple factor analysis to identify the spatial distribution of marginal land suitable for nine major energy crops in China. Climate scenarios were generated based on bias-corrected results of five different climate models under two representative concentration pathways (RCP2.6 and 8.5). Results show that climate change is projected to have a substantial impact on the land availability for biofuel production in the 2050s under both RCPs. The total amount of marginal land suitable for energy crops was 170.2 million hectares for the period of 2010–2019, and would increase in the 2050s under both RCPs. The changing pattern of area are similar under both RCP 2.6 and 8.5, only the magnitude is different. All the species are projected to have a northward spread in China. The amount of marginal land suitable for all the energy crops is projected to increase in the 2050s, except for Miscanthus floridulus, and Miscanthus lutarioriparius under RCP 8.5. However, the potential productivity of the energy crops is projected to have a substantial decrease in the 2050s. The average yields of the energy crops are only about one fourth of their yields in the 2010s due to climate change. Combined with high costs of producing biofuels and numerous ecological tradeoffs, it is likely that liquid biofuels development using 1.5 and 2-generation energy crops does not have an optimistic perspective in China. © 2020

AB  - Biomethane production was systematically evaluated with sugarcane trash pretreated by liquid hot water (LHW), dilute acid (DA) and KOH solutions. Multiple linear regression analysis identified glucan in pretreated solid residue as well as C5 sugars and acetic acid in pretreatment hydrolysate as the key parameters affecting biomethane potentials. Moreover, biomethane production was best simulated using Chen & Hashimoto model with a predicted highest methane yield of 187 mL/g initial total solids (TS) based on LHW (130 °C for 15 min) and KOH (10% on trash, 150 °C for 60 min) pretreatments. KOH pretreatment led to a biomethane yield of 167 mL/g initial TS at day 25, 82%, 34% and 33% higher than those achieved with untreated and pretreated trash samples with optimal LHW and DA conditions, respectively. This study led to the identification of best kinetic model and pretreatment condition for biomethane production from sugarcane trash through a systematic evaluation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fresh water samples from six perennial rain fed reservoirs were collected for isolation of microalgae by enrichment method. Eighteen isolates belonging to cyanophyta and chlorophyta were obtained after 15 days of incubation in BG-11 medium under 16: 8 light and dark cycle at room temperature. Upon evaluation of oleaginous potential for future application in biodiesel synthesis, only three isolates BV3 (Nostoc sp.), BV4 (Nostoc sp.) and BV14 (Cyanobacteria) were selected. Lipid production, growth profile and lipid characteristic were also studied for the three isolates. The lipid content of the isolates BV 3, BV4 and BV14 were found to be 12.306 ± 1.313, 17.309 ± 2.129 and 26.567 ± 3.582% DW, respectively and lipid productivity recorded were 0.159 ± 0.011, 0.106 ± 0.007 and 0.046 ± 0.004 g L−1d−1, respectively. The specific growth rate was also determined for BV3 (0.177 d−1), BV4 (0.233 d−1) and BV14 (0.183 d−1). Analysis of lipid further revealed the presence of neutral lipids and saturated short chain alkanes. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In this experimental investigation, the impact of engine load, compression ratio, and percentage blends of biofuel on exergy, energy, and sustainability parameters for the samples of diesel based (10–40% v/v) biodiesel blends were performed on variable compression ratio engine. The brake thermal efficiency, exergy efficiency, engine sustainability, exergy destruction rate, and other exergy parameters were found to escalate with the escalating engine load, compression ratio, and percentage of Shorea robusta methyl ester biodiesel fuel blends. The exergy and energy efficiency of the engine with diesel fuel were 2.05%, 6.98%, and 10.63%, respectively higher than 10%, 30%, and 40% Shorea robusta methyl ester fuel and 2.23%, 8.67%, and 9.22%, respectively at 50% engine load and 1500 rpm engine speed. The influence of compression ratio, engine load, and fuel blends on the exergetic performance parameters revealed a similar trend with energetic parameters, but the magnitude of exergy parameters was found lower than the energetic parameters. The application of Shorea robusta methyl ester biodiesel blends improved the combustion characteristics with a small drop in energy and exergy performance parameters and sustainability of the engine. The exergy destruction rate and entropy generation rate for shorea robusta methyl ester biodiesel blend were found lower than the conventional fuel. Therefore, the fuel blend have a high potential to be an alternate to the conventional fuel without any design modification of diesel engines. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Enhancement of the transesterification efficiency of triglyceride has come under heated study in biodiesel-making industry. In this research, the NiMo/La-Al2O3 nanopowders have been prepared for producing biodiesel efficiently. The screening test showed that the NiMo/La-Al2O3 catalyst has the best catalytic activity for triglyceride transesterification. Besides, the process parameters including reaction temperature, time, oil-to-alcohol ratio and catalyst loading etc., also have been investigated for optimization of the transesterification process. The results showed that with 5 wt% of catalyst loading, and oil to methanol molar ratio of 1:9, the conversion yield of triglyceride could be up to 95.2% within 120 min at 160°C. The NiMo/La-Al2O3 catalyst has the outstanding recycle property, which proved that the prepared NiMo/La-Al2O3 powders can be suitable for biodiesels’ production. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - A sustainable bio-based fuel industry is dependent on finding efficient technologies for the production of biofuels. A microwave-assisted method to produce bio-butanol from bio-ethanol in liquid phase was investigated using a 2-level factorial design with catalyst type and loading, reaction temperature and reaction time as variables. A combined severity factor (CSF) was used to quantify the combined effect of all reaction conditions on ethanol conversion and butanol selectivity. From the results, it could be qualitatively deduced that the reaction initially followed the Guerbet mechanism for formation of butanol, but gradually shifted toward the direct coupling mechanism as reaction conditions became more severe with 50% of the butanol produced at a CSF of 6, produced through the direct coupling mechanism. The overall reaction order and observed specific reaction rate was determined as 1.54 ± 0.26 and 2.91·10−6 ± 2.36·10−7 g.0.54.L−0.54.s−1 respectively. Both high ethanol conversions (76.6 wt%) and high butanol selectivity (60 wt%) could be obtained in a very short reaction time (60 minutes). The results represent an improvement in reaction time, ethanol conversion and butanol selectivity of 300%, 47% and 16.7% respectively compared to previously reported data. This represents a significant step towards realizing an affordable low-carbon drop-in fuel for a low carbon economy. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Sustainable lignocellulosic spent waste rice straw (SWRS) from bioethanol production inventively applied in this study to valorize petroleum production produced water (PPPW). SWRS expressed efficient pollutant removal over a wide range of petroleum concentration, temperature, pH, salinity, and mixing rate reaching approximately 217 mg/g, within four hours contact time. Kinetic studies revealed a pseudo-second-order chemisorption process with a boundary layer control and 16.97 kJ/mol activation energy where the intra-particle diffusion was not the only rate regulatory step. Thermodynamic studies revealed spontaneous, favorable, and endothermic adsorption, with a strong affinity between the SWRS and oil molecules. Biosorption mechanism studies proved the enrollment of SWRS components’ lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose in the oil uptake with the predominance of chemisorption over physisorption onto the rough and highly porous SWRS surface. A single-stage batch biosorption process was designed based on the best fitted Langmuir adsorption isotherm and applied on a real PPPW sample. The Egyptian standard limits for safe industrial effluents discharge into marine environment with a concomitant decrease in scale formation precursors were achieved recommending its safe reuse for enhanced oil recovery. Finally, for accomplishing zero-waste, SWRS disposed of PPPW treatment substantiated valorized solid biofuel with a sufficient calorific value 38.56 MJ/kg. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Conventional thermochemical conversion techniques for biofuel production from lignocellulosic biomass is often non-selective and energy inefficient. Microwave assisted pyrolysis (MAP) is cost and energy-efficient technology aimed for value-added bioproducts recovery from biomass with less environmental impacts. The present review emphasizes the performance of MAP in terms of product yield, characteristics and energy consumption and further it compares it with conventional pyrolysis. The significant role of biochar as catalyst in microwave pyrolysis for enhancing the product selectivity and quality, and the influence of microwave activation on product composition identified through sophisticated techniques has been highlighted. Besides, the application of MAP based biochar as soil conditioner and heavy metal immobilization has been illustrated. MAP accomplished at low temperature creates uniform thermal gradient than conventional mode, thereby producing engineered char with hotspots that could be used as catalysts for gasification, energy storage, etc. The stability, nutrient content, surface properties and adsorption capacity of biochar was enhanced by microwave activation, thus facilitating its use as soil conditioner. Many reviews until now on MAP mostly dealt with operational conditions and product yield with limited focus on comparative energy consumption with conventional mode, analytical techniques for product characterization and end application especially concerning agriculture. Thus, the present review adds on to the current state of art on microwave assisted pyrolysis covering all-round aspects of production followed by characterization and applications as soil amendment for increasing crop productivity in addition to the production of value-added chemicals, thus promoting process sustainability in energy and environment nexus. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bioproduction of renewable chemicals is considered as an urgent solution for fossil energy crisis. However, despite tremendous efforts, it is still challenging to generate microbial strains that can produce target biochemical to high levels. Here, we report an example of biosynthesis of high-value and easy-recoverable derivatives built upon natural microbial pathways, leading to improvement in bioproduction efficiency. By leveraging pathways in solventogenic clostridia for co-producing acyl-CoAs, acids and alcohols as precursors, through rational screening for host strains and enzymes, systematic metabolic engineering-including elimination of putative prophages, we develop strains that can produce 20.3 g/L butyl acetate and 1.6 g/L butyl butyrate. Techno-economic analysis results suggest the economic competitiveness of our developed bioprocess. Our principles of selecting the most appropriate host for specific bioproduction and engineering microbial chassis to produce high-value and easy-separable end products may be applicable to other bioprocesses. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Microalgae-based high-density fuels offer an efficient and environmental pathway towards decarbonization of the transport sector and could be produced as part of a globally distributed network without competing with food systems for arable land. Variations in climatic and economic conditions significantly impact the economic feasibility and productivity of such fuel systems, requiring harmonized technoeconomic assessments to identify important conditions required for commercial scale up. Methods: Here, our previously validated Techno-economic and Lifecycle Analysis (TELCA) platform was extended to provide a direct performance comparison of microalgae diesel production at 12 international locations with variable climatic and economic settings. For each location, historical weather data, and jurisdiction-specific policy and economic inputs were used to simulate algal productivity, evaporation rates, harvest regime, CapEx and OpEx, interest and tax under location-specific operational parameters optimized for Minimum Diesel Selling Price (MDSP, US$ L−1). The economic feasibility, production capacity and CO2-eq emissions of a defined 500 ha algae-based diesel production facility is reported for each. Results: Under a for-profit business model, 10 of the 12 locations achieved a minimum diesel selling price (MDSP) under US$ 1.85 L−1 / US$ 6.99 gal−1. At a fixed theoretical MDSP of US$ 2 L−1 (US$ 7.57 gal−1) these locations could achieve a profitable Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 9.5–22.1%. Under a public utility model (0% profit, 0% tax) eight locations delivered cost-competitive renewable diesel at an MDSP of &lt; US$ 1.24 L−1 (US$ 4.69 gal−1). The CO2-eq emissions of microalgae diesel were about one-third of fossil-based diesel. Conclusions: The public utility approach could reduce the fuel price toward cost-competitiveness, providing a key step on the path to a profitable fully commercial renewable fuel industry by attracting the investment needed to advance technology and commercial biorefinery co-production options. Governments’ adoption of such an approach could accelerate decarbonization, improve fuel security, and help support a local COVID-19 economic recovery. This study highlights the benefits and limitations of different factors at each location (e.g., climate, labour costs, policy, C-credits) in terms of the development of the technology—providing insights on how governments, investors and industry can drive the technology forward.

AB  - Background: Both APETALA2/Ethylene Responsive Factor (AP2/ERF) superfamily and R2R3-MYB family were from one of the largest diverse families of transcription factors (TFs) in plants, and played important roles in plant development and responses to various stresses. However, no systematic analysis of these TFs had been conducted in the green algae A. protothecoides heretofore. Temperature was a critical factor affecting growth and lipid metabolism of A. protothecoides. It also remained largely unknown whether these TFs would respond to temperature stress and be involved in controlling lipid metabolism process. Results: Hereby, a total of six AP2 TFs, six ERF TFs and six R2R3-MYB TFs were identified and their expression profiles were also analyzed under low-temperature (LT) and high-temperature (HT) stresses. Meanwhile, differential adjustments of lipid pathways were triggered, with enhanced triacylglycerol accumulation. A co-expression network was built between these 18 TFs and 32 lipid-metabolism-related genes, suggesting intrinsic associations between TFs and the regulatory mechanism of lipid metabolism. Conclusions: This study represented an important first step towards identifying functions and roles of AP2 superfamily and R2R3-MYB family in lipid adjustments and response to temperature stress. These findings would facilitate the biotechnological development in microalgae-based biofuel production and the better understanding of photosynthetic organisms’ adaptive mechanism to temperature stress. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Transportation is a crucial aspect of global development and the utilization of fossil fuels in most combustions systems seems inevitable. This class of fuel has led greatly to worldwide environmental pollution with its attendant effects on human health and climate changes. Biofuels from biomass are sustainable and viable alternatives that can eliminate the problems associated with petroleum fuels and are most compatible with the existing combustion systems. Biodiesel will further ensure positive energy equilibrium through the conservation of natural resources to improve economic stability, environmental safety and a balanced ecosystem. Most previous works make use of edible oils, which can lead to food security and price challenges. With the abundance of non-edible oil sources unexploited, the choice of this study is directed towards producing biodiesel from a non-edible seed with little or no information on its combustion properties. This study extracted Sandbox (Hura crepitans) oil chemically using analytical n-hexane as solvent and subsequently produced biodiesel from the oil via one step-transesterification. The biodiesel was characterized according to global standards for biodiesel (ASTM D6751 and EN 14214) and blended with petrodiesel to give five fuel samples (D100, B10, B20, B30 and B100). These fuels were combusted in a compression ignition (CI) engine test bed to determine its performance and emission characteristics. The results showed that the Sandbox seed produced oil with a good oil yield of 47.77% and the biodiesel produced had a yield of 86.49%, which satisfies the recommended global standards. B10 exhibited the best and highest BTE after D100 at all the torque levels (4 Nm, 6 Nm and 7 Nm) as well as the least and the most desirable emission of CO2 when compared with all the other fuels. The utilization of Sandbox biodiesel in combustion ignition engine was found to be a viable option at enhancing biofuel utilization and reduction of pollutant emissions from the present combustion of fossil fuels. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Recently, Biodiesels are found high popularity as environmentally friendly and renewable fuels. Suitable combustion, appropriate atomization process, high flash point, and proper cetane number approved biodiesels as potential alternative for petroleum-based diesel fuels. Since, characteristics of biodiesels as well as biodiesel-diesel blends are directly related to their viscosity, an accurate approach is required for prediction of this important transport property. Therefore, this study tries to compare the accuracy of different empirical and intelligent paradigms for estimation of biodiesel-diesel blends. For this regard, the best topology of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) and least squares support vector machines (LSSVM) are determined at first, and then their predictive performances are compared with five empirical correlations in literatures. Combination of statistical study and ranking analysis justified that the LSSVM with polynomial kernel is the most accurate approach for the considered matter. The designed model estimated kinematic viscosity of 636 biodiesel-diesel blends with an excellent AARD = 0.754%, MAE = 0.03, RAE = 1.98%, RRSE = 2.3%, MSE = 0.003, RMSE = 0.05, and R2-value of 0.9997. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The development of efficient processes for the upgrading of low value bio-derived liquid intermediates to high added value products in biorefineries is critical for the establishment of a robust and competitive bio-based economy. We show in this paper that low quality surrogate heavy naphtha, representative of biofuels from thermochemical biomass conversion processes, can be efficiently converted to high quality fuel and chemicals (olefins) via hydroisomerization and catalytic cracking, respectively. Hydroisomerization over a low loading 0.1 wt% Pt/ZSM-5 catalyst leads to the conversion of normal paraffins to C5-C8 isoparaffins with limited cracking, and produces a fuel with higher octane and lower cetane number, suitable for use in future powertrains such as HCCI engines. Catalytic cracking of the naphtha on a commercial ZSM-5 based FCC catalyst results in the production of a significant amount of olefins at 600 °C, primarily propylene followed by ethylene, n-butene, pentene and i-butene. Both processes are validated on pilot scale. Some differences observed between bench and pilot scale results are due to scalability phenomena and different reaction conditions. Still, excellent agreement with regards to the composition of the products at similar conversion level exists, demonstrating the scalability and applicability of these upgrading processes in thermochemical biorefineries. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The combination of lactic acid production wastewater and oil-producing microalgal culture could not only achieve harmless treatment of wastewater but also provided nutrients and significant amounts of water for microalgal culture. Thus the effects of different nutrients on the biomass yield, lipid yield of Scenedesmus dimorphus with lactic acid wastewater were investigated. Although lactic acid wastewater was very suitable for the cultivation of oil-producing microalgae, some nutrients were still needed. So 0.79 g/L NaNO3, 14 mg/L MgSO4·7H2O, 4 mg/L K2HPO4·3H2O, and trace elements needed to be added in the microalgal culture with lactic acid wastewater. In the optimized wastewater medium, the lipid yield could reach 1.54 ± 0.04 g/L, which was 48.1% higher than the level of 1.04 ± 0.06 g/L in the BG11 medium. Microalgae cells had high absorption capacity for nitrogen and phosphorus. The nitrogen, phosphorus removal rate of wastewater reached 96.31% and 90.78%, respectively, after 10 days of culture. And the treated wastewater could be used for lactic acid production for four times. These investigations laid a foundation for reducing the pollution of lactic acid wastewater, exploring a late-model for oleaginous microalgae cleaner production. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biorefining of second-generation feedstock gains more attention to improve the living standards and promote circular bioeconomy. The biorefinery concept made an effort to make the environmentally sustainable and economical products. Lignocellulosic biomass is widely available and extensively tested feedstock to produce biofuels, bioenergy and different value- products. By the integration of process to fractionate the lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose can add more values in the process chain that required integration and optimized technologies followed by life cycle analysis and economic assessment. The life cycle and economic analysis together assess the impacts on environment, economic and all the impacts which are involved indirectly throughout the product stages from cradle to grave. The improvement and integration of the current biorefinery process recommends the newer and sustainable bio-economy and will replace the fossil fuels with the renewable reserve. In techno-economic perspective, the optimization of integrated technologies for the production of biofuels and other bioproducts have still to be optimized for efficient production. The proper adoption of pretreatment methods increases the economic value in biorefinery process. The main aim of this review is to summarize the three key research areas that required more attentions, they are; (a) valorization of lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose into value added products, (b) integrated biorefinery approach and process optimization; and (c) circular bioeconomy and its future perspective. This review concludes that the lignocellulosic integrated biorefinery approach is feasible to support the circular bioeconomy, through which number of value products could be derived. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Cardoon is low-input biomass which can be efficiently exploited in the modern biorefinery for multi-purpose uses. In this work, cardoon lignocellulosic stalks underwent to acid-catalyzed steam explosion. A design of experiments approach was employed to assess the effect of the process variables (acid concentration, temperature and reaction time) on xylan recovery after direct hydrolysis and cellulose digestibility in the enzymatic hydrolysis step. According to the statistical model generated, the optimal conditions to maximize overall monosaccharides yield were 166 °C, 1.45% (w/w) and 10 min. A monosaccharides production and inhibitors formation of 36.76 g/100 g raw material (close to 70% of the maximal theoretical yield) and 1.80 g/100 g raw material, respectively, were achieved. The scale-up of the hydrolysis step showed superior performance of the washed solid fraction than to the whole slurry, resulting in cellulose conversion to glucose by 76% vs 58%. By employing the life cycle assessment approach, it was possible to determine the environmental impact in terms of the global warming potential (3.18 kgCO2eq/kg of fermentable carbohydrates) and cumulative energy demand (43.34 MJ/kg of fermentable carbohydrates). The low-inhibitor and high-sugar hydrolysate can be fermented to biochemicals and biofuels without any detoxification process. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Presently more energy is sourced from the natural gas grid than the electricity grid in the EU and the US. Furthermore hard-to-abate sectors such as heavy-duty transport are not readily served by electricity. Decarbonised energy systems will require renewable fuels (such as biomethane) to reduce the reliance on fossil-based diesel and natural gas. Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a technology which with other bio-based technologies can effect improved energy conversion and reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across sectors beyond energy. Here, an AD-centred cascading circular system with carbon capture and utilisation was proposed by incorporating power to gas (P2G), microbial electrolysis cell (MEC), and digestate valorisation for biochar production. The system as modelled converted CO2 to biomethane and digestate to biochar for CO2 sequestration. This was exemplified through cattle slurry with an annual production of 3.03 billion tons in three studied regions (the EU, China and the US), which was shown to produce a maximum of 2.29 EJ (equivalent to 1.64% of natural gas demand in 2018) of total energy in the form of advanced biofuels (biomethane, bio-oil and syngas) via the AD-MEC system, which was preferable to a conventional AD or an AD-P2G system. The treatment of cattle slurry with AD-MEC led to a combined 397.4 MtCO2e of GHG emission savings in the three regions. This could contribute to avoiding 2.0% of GHG emissions (total 20.1 GtCO2e) in the three regions. The sustainability of such a system was shown to be dependent on access to low-carbon and low-cost electricity systems. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Waste-to-energy is a promising approach to tackle the energy shortage and reduce the environmental pollution. The present study aimed to evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of microwave vacuum co-pyrolysis of seaweeds and low-density polyethylene (LDPE). Although the three studied seaweeds namely; Ulva intestinalis, Sargassum polycystum, and Hypnea valentiae showed similar thermal weight loss profile, U. intestinalis showed the highest biomass and bio-oil yields which resulted in superior bio-oil areal productivity of 30.1 g m−2. Therefore, it was selected for co-pyrolysis with LDPE at different blend ratios. Compared to individual pyrolysis of U. intestinalis, the increase inLDPE ratio enhanced the crude bio-oil production with simultaneous reduction in bio-char yield. The experimental bio-oil yields from co-pyrolysis showed higher values than the corresponding theoretical values, confirming a synergistic effect between the two feedstocks. The bio-oil produced from co-pyrolysis at 75% LDPE blend ratio showed better characteristics compared to the individual pyrolysis. Van Krevelen plot suggested that LDPE produces hydrogen radicals during co-pyrolysis reactions, which increased the H/C ratio and reduced the O/C ratio. GC/MS analysis confirmed that the increase in LDPE stimulates hydrocarbons proportion up to 51.2% at 75% blend ratio with significant reduction in N-containing compounds, carboxylic acids, furans, aldehydes/ketones, saccharides, and phenols. The economic feasibility analysis at a feedstock feeding rate of 11.4 ton h−1 using Aspen Plus showed estimated net profit of 23.17 million US$ for a 20-years life time plant. The present study provides a potential approach for sustainable energy recovery from waste plastic/seaweeds blend using microwave vacuum co-pyrolysis. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Activated carbons have recently emerged as renewable and efficient catalysts in converting low-density polyethylene (LDPE) into valuable chemical and fuels, while the effects of various structure characters and operating conditions on the catalytic reactions of LDPE have not been well interpreted. Here, the renewable Chestnut shell is used to produce catalyst (CNSACC), then applied in catalytic pyrolysis process for the first time to conclude fatidic perception in the optimal process in improving jet fuel range aromatics and H2-enriched fuel gas. Activating reagent concentration and carbonization temperature play critical roles in the specific surface area and acidity, having optima conditions in obtaining target chemicals due to unique inherent structure of parent CNS. The catalytic temperature and catalyst loading also give rise to different catalytic performance. The results showed that the main compositions of attained bio-oil are belonged to jet fuel range hydrocarbons (up to 100%). The optimal selectivity of aromatics (95.88%) with a high content of H2 (65.37 vol%) could be achieved at a H3PO4/CNS ratio of 0.8, carbonization temperature of 850 °C, catalytic temperature of 550 °C and CNSACC/LDPE ratio of 1.0. This may provide fresh insight into fabricating catalyst from biomass, and give suggestions to upgradation of pyrolysis products. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To decrease the cost of biodiesel production, undeveloped nonedible Semen Abutili seed oil (SASO) was first used as a feedstock to prepare biodiesel. Some low-cost liquid lipases were screened and used as green catalysts for biodiesel production via the ethanolysis of SASO. The effect of reaction factors on ethanolysis was optimized by the response surface methodology (RSM). The results demonstrated that SASO was a promising alternative feedstock, and Eversa® Transform 2.0 showed the best performance for biodiesel production from low-quality SASO feedstock (high FFA and phospholipid contents). In addition, Eversa® Transform 2.0 can be reused 3 times without significant loss. The influence of reaction factors on biodiesel yield decreased in the order of reaction temperature &gt; lipase load &gt; reaction time. The maximum biodiesel yield was 94.2 ± 1.3 % under the optimal conditions (lipase load 6%, water content 20 %, 7:1 (mol/mol) ethanol to SASO, 11 h, 37 °C). The kinetic parameters (Vmax and K'm) of the transesterification of SASO were 4.16 × 10−2mol/(L∙min) and 5.27 × 10-1 mol/L, respectively. The Arrhenius equation and activation energy, Ea, of Eversa® Transform 2.0-catalyzed transesterification of SASO were lnV0 = 4.8252–2382.3/T and 19.80 kJ/mol, respectively. The biodiesel produced from SASO was accordance with the ASTM D6751 standard, except for the oxidation stability. Thus, SASO, an undeveloped nonedible low-quality vegetable oil, can be used as a potential feedstock for biodiesel production, and the low-cost liquid lipase Eversa® Transform 2.0 can be used for biodiesel production. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The automotive industry is directly affected by the shortage of fossil fuels and the excessive pollution resulting from crude oil-based fuels has many adverse effects on the environment. The search for a greener and sustainable source of materials and fuels to power automobiles has ultimately led to the usage of biomass and biobased sources as the main precursor due to its graft availability and renewability. Biobased fuels developed have been shown to easily blend in with the existing automobile engines and to provide sustainable performance. Similarly, the usage of various biobased polymers, plastics, and composite materials as the structural materials for the construction of automobiles instead of crude oil sources have shown to be invaluable. The powering of automobiles with electricity is the future of the transportation industry to address the greenhouse gas emissions caused by fossil fuels. Hence, biobased lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors have started to enter the mid-sized automotive industry. However, extensive commercialization of biobased products application in the automotive sector is underdeveloped. Hence it is customary to assess the various drawbacks of using biobased materials and identify the correct pathway for new research and development in this field. Therefore, this review covers various applications of biobased products in the automotive industries and mentions the active researches going on in this field to replace petroleum and crude oil-based sources with biobased sources. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The activity of Mo2C-based catalyst on vegetable oil conversion into biofuel could be greatedly promoted by tuning the carbon content, while its modification mechanism on the surface properties remained elusive. Herein, the exposed active sites, the particle size and Lewis acid amount of Ni-Mo2C/MCM-41 catalysts were regulated by varying CH4 content in carbonization gas. The activity of Ni-Mo2C/MCM-41 catalysts in jatropha oil (JO) conversion showed a volcano-like trend over the catalysts with increasing CH4 content from 15% to 50% in the preparation process. The one prepared by 25% CH4 content (Ni-Mo2C(25)/MCM-41) exhibited the outstanding catalytic performance with 83.9 wt% biofuel yield and 95.2% C15–C18 selectivity. Such a variation of activity was ascribed to the most exposed active sites, the smallest particle size, and the lowest Lewis acid amount from Ni0 on the Ni-Mo2C(25)/MCM-41 catalyst surface. Moreover, the Ni-Mo2C(25)/MCM-41 catalyst could also effectively catalyze the conversion of crude waste cooking oil (WCO) into green diesel. This study offers an effective strategy to improve catalytic performance of molybdenum carbide catalyst on vegetable oil conversion. © 2021 Science Press

AB  - Liquid fossil fuels (1) enable transportation and (2) provide energy for mobile work platforms and (3) supply dispatchable energy to highly variable demand (seasonal heating and peak electricity). We describe a system to replace liquid fossil fuels with drop-in biofuels including gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. Because growing biomass removes carbon dioxide from the air, there is no net addition of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere from burning biofuels. In addition, with proper management, biofuel systems can sequester large quantities of carbon as soil organic matter, improving soil fertility and providing other environmental services. In the United States liquid biofuels can potentially replace all liquid fossil fuels. The required system has two key features. First, the heat and hydrogen for conversion of biomass into high-quality liquid fuels is provided by external low-carbon energy sources–nuclear energy or fossil fuels with carbon capture and sequestration. Using external energy inputs can almost double the energy content of the liquid fuel per unit of biomass feedstock by fully converting the carbon in biomass into a hydrocarbon fuel. Second, competing effectively with fossil fuels requires very large biorefineries—the equivalent of a 250,000 barrel per day oil refinery. This requires commercializing methods for converting local biomass into high-density storable feedstocks that can be economically shipped to large-scale biorefineries. © 2021

AB  - The present study investigates the suitability of preheated Vateria indica methyl ester (VIME) as an alternative fuel for a diesel engine. VIME is a renewable, non-toxic and sustainable alternative biodiesel obtained from Dhupa fat by transesterification. This study aims to evaluate the combustion, performance, and emission characteristics of four different blends such as B0 (0% VIME and 100% mineral diesel), B30, B50 and B100 at elevated fuel inlet temperatures ranging from 35 °C to 95 °C. The tests are carried out in a single cylinder diesel engine at optimum loading condition and fixed speed. Results are obtained in terms of brake thermal efficiency (BTE), brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), in-cylinder pressure, heat release rate and exhaust emissions (CO, HC, NOX, CO2 and soot). It is observed that the preheating of blends decreases the viscosity which enhances fuel spray characteristics, leading to higher engine performance, lower CO and HC emissions with a slight increase in NOX and CO2 emissions. BTE and peak in-cylinder pressure for B100 at 95 °C and 75% load are increased by 7.44%, 2.97% respectively compared to unheated B100 biodiesel. BSFC, CO, HC emissions at 75% load for B100 at 95 °C are reduced by 26.73%, 28.08%, 42.7% respectively compared to unheated B100. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, hydrotreating Callophyllum inophyllum oil (CIO) was performed using hierarchical porous carbon (HPC) supported catalyst prepared from a massively produced waste, coconut lumber sawdust (Cocos nucifera L.), using only K2CO3 as activating agent for a green process. Coconut lumber sawdust was carbonized at 700 °C for 2 h to obtain coke as starting material. The produced coke was then activated at various furnace temperature and K2CO3/Coke weight ratio to generate six different types of HPC supports: HPC2-600, HPC2-700, HPC3-600, HPC3-700, HPC4-600, and HPC4-700. Iodine value has shown that HPC prepared at 700 °C h using K2CO3/Coke weight ratio of 3 (HPC3-700) exhibited the best adsorptive capacity, thus, depicting the most promising potential as a hydrotreating catalyst. In the hydrotreatment of CIO at 550 °C for 2 h using 1:300 (catalyst:feed) weight ratio, with a small addition of Ni to the pore (2.76 wt%), Ni/HPC3-700 catalyst, possessing 400.6 m2 g−1 BET surface area and 1.076 mmol g−1 acidity value, was able to produce a satisfying result by yielding over 74 wt% liquid product with 65 wt% hydrocarbon compounds. According to reusability study, although a gradual decrease of deoxygenation effectivity can be reflected through a declining hydrocarbon production, the level of liquid product generated by the catalyst remained consistent after its 3rd use in the hydrotreatment. The use of a low-cost high performing catalyst for hydrotreating a highly available non-edible oil in this study has offered a more sustainable and economical biofuel production with an environmental benefit. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is the most abundant and sustainable feedstock available globally. As a source of the polysaccharides, cellulose and hemicellulose, it can be converted into biofuels and other platform chemicals. This article highlights some important aspects that needs to be focused upon for the commercial development of lignocellulosic biorefineries. Although, lignocellulosic biomass offers clear value in terms of its green advantages and sustainability, there has been very low commercial success at industrial production levels. This can be attributed to a few key factors such as an irregular biomass supply chain, inefficient or complex pre-treatment and saccharification technologies, and scale up challenges leading to high capital and operating expenditures. Moreover, techno-economic studies performed on lignocellulosic biorefineries have revealed that process complexity is the most detrimental factor prohibiting scale-up. Although there have been several research efforts funded both by the public and private sectors, biomass valorization into biofuels and chemicals remains a technical and economical challenge. This review examines the global drivers towards the advancements of lignocellulosic biorefineries, technical and operational challenges for industrialization and future directions towards overcoming them. © 2021

AB  - There is a growing interest in making the overall aviation industry more environmentally-friendly by developing advanced biofuels. In this context, the main driver is establishing feedstocks with lower environmental loads and higher energy use efficiency. The objective of this study was to evaluate the energy requirement and environmental impacts of hydroprocessed renewable jet fuel (HRJ) production from pennycress. The system boundary included pennycress production, logistics, oil extraction and conversion to HRJ, wastewater treatment, and electricity and steam generation. Energy allocation method was used for the analysis. The functional unit was considered to be one GJ of HRJ, and the biorefinery size was considered to be 18.9 million l/yr (5 million gal/yr) HRJ. Energy use efficiency of pennycress-based HRJ production was estimated to be 3.9–5.5 (90% central range), which was higher than that of HRJ from other oilseeds, such as canola. Global warming potential of pennycress-based HRJ (35–49 kgCO2eq/GJ of HRJ (90% central range)) was also lower than those of HRJ from similar oilseeds and the commercial jet fuel baseline. Pennycress production was the main contributor to the total energy use and environmental impacts of HRJ production, mainly due to the use of nitrogen fertilizer for production, and fuel combustion for farm operations. Pennycress yield was identified as the most sensitive parameter affecting the energy use efficiency and environmental impacts of HRJ production. The outcomes of this study are useful for identifying the performance targets towards improving energy use efficiency and environmental performance of pennycress-based HRJ production at the commercial scale. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An integrated optimization model for an organic-waste-derived butyric acid-to-butanol supply-chain network (BABSCN) is proposed to minimize the total network cost by simultaneously optimizing both strategic biodiesel production and waste management planning decisions. This model is useful for ensuring effective organic-waste provision for large-scale biodiesel production and waste management. The proposed mixed-integer linear-programming model optimizes the activities ranging from organic-waste preprocessing to butyric acid (BA), transportation of BA to biorefinery, butanol (BuOH) production and mixing with diesel to the distribution of biodiesel. This model is useful for forecasting organic-waste management biodiesel supply chains in South Korea in 2030. The case study results show that a total network cost of $US 3.16/gallon of B3 contains 3% BuOH from organic waste products combined with diesel. The biorefinery-related cost accounts for 98.3% of the total network cost, followed by the organic waste procurement cost (1.1%) and biodiesel distribution cost (0.6%). A scenario-based analysis shows that a 7%-BuOH increase in biodiesel increases the total network cost by 18.8%. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae are a potential candidate for biofuels, but the high cost and low biomass yield hinder the scale-up application of microalgae. In this study, a novel walnut shell based self-permeating biofilm reactor (WSPBR) was proposed for cultivation of Chlorella vulgaris (C. vulgaris) and Scenedesmus obliquus (S. obliquus). Major influencing factors such as walnut shell size, light intensity and CO2 concentration were studied in detail. The results showed that CO2 can enhance the storage of metabolic products in microalgal cells. Thermodynamics analysis indicated that C. vulgaris and S. obliquus were likely to adhere on the surface of walnut shells. S. obliquus and C. vulgaris biomass reached the maximum values of 97.43 and 70.49 g m−2, respectively, corresponding to the walnut shell size of 0.8–1.2 mm, light intensity of 150 μmol m−2 s−1 and CO2 concentration of 2%. The lipid contents of these microalgal cells were 34.32% and 28.94%, respectively. These results indicated that WSPBR was an efficient system for microalgae cultivation as feedstock for biofuels. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - 2-Methylfuran (MF) is considered as a promising second-generation biofuel for spark ignition engines. MF has better anti-knock ability, and the lower heating value of MF is close to that of conventional fuels. The production methods of MF have been largely improved over the last decade. However, the studies of MF on direct injection spark ignition (DISI) engines are quite limited, and little is known about the effects of engine control parameters on MF combustion at typical DISI engine operating conditions. In the present work, the effects of engine control parameters including spark timing, air–fuel ratio, injection timing, and injection pressure on combustion and engine performances of MF were studied at typical medium load and high load conditions on a single-cylinder spray-guided DISI engine, compared to gasoline and ethanol. The results show that the achievable spark timing range considering combustion phasing and knock limit for MF is larger than that of gasoline especially at high load. MF has more robustness to lean burn than gasoline and ethanol. The combustion characteristics and heat release of MF have low sensibility to the variation of injection timings. To achieve the same engine load MF requires up to 25% longer injection durations than gasoline, however, increased injection pressure can mitigate the injection duration differences between MF and gasoline. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Tobacco is traditionally used for cigarettes and cigars manufacturing and after the drying process a great quantity of dry tobacco stalks is treated as waste. In this framework, the scope of the paper is to examine the use of tobacco stems to feed a biomass boiler after a chipping process. The study is focused on southern Italy area thus, firstly, the assessment of tobacco availability in Italy and Campania region has been determined. Then, Burley tobacco stalks sampled out in an air-curing factory of south Italy crop have been characterized according to ASTM D5142 and ASTM D5373 standards. Thereby, biomass and natural gas fuelled boilers have been compared through an energy, environmental and economic analysis on simulative basis. Both systems satisfy the thermal energy demands of a multi-purpose condominium located in a cold Italian climatic zone near the factory. The results have demonstrated that boiler fed by tobacco chips ensures environmental and economic advantages compared to traditional system. In particular, it guarantees a reduction of CO2 emissions up to 16.59 tCO2 in one of investigated scenarios and a simple payback period and a net present value of about 5.6 years and 17,168 € (without economic support), respectively. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Magnetic mesoporous solid acid catalysts, designed as Fe3O4@SBA-15@HPW and Fe3O4@SBA-15-NH2-HPW, were prepared for the production of biodiesel by the transesterification of palm oil with methanol. The magnetic mesoporous carrier was modified by two different methods: post-gifting method and impregnation method. The structure of the catalysts was characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, FT-IR, VSM, Pyridine-FT-IR, N2 adsorption-desorption and TGA. The results indicated that they all had ordered mesoporous and excellent paramagnetic. Both Fe3O4@SBA-15@HPW and Fe3O4@SBA-15-NH2-HPW had high content of Brønsted acid sites due to the loading of 12-tungstophosphoric acid, which made the two catalysts very active. Particularly, Fe3O4@SBA-15-NH2-HPW was very efficient in the transesterification of palm oil with methanol and gave a more than 91% biodiesel yield when the reaction was carried out at 150 °C with a 4 wt% catalyst amount at 20:1 methanol/oil molar ratio for 5 h Fe3O4@SBA-15-NH2-HPW prepared by the grafting method exhibited higher reusability, and the yield of biodiesel was more than 80% after 6 times cycles, which made the catalyst have an excellent industrial application prospect. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Since 2000, corn ethanol production in the USA has increased significantly – from 1.6 to 15 billion gallons (6.1 to 57 billion liters) – due to supportive biofuel policies. In this study, we conduct a retrospective analysis of the changes in US corn ethanol greenhouse gas emission intensity, sometimes known as carbon intensity (CI), over the 15 years from 2005 to 2019. Our analysis shows a significant decrease in CI: from 58 to 45 gCO2e/MJ of corn ethanol (a 23% reduction). This is due to several factors. Corn grain yield has increased continuously, reaching 168 bushels/acre (10.5 metric tons/ha, a 15% increase) while fertilizer inputs per acre have remained constant, resulting in decreased intensities of fertilizer inputs (e.g., 7% and 18% reduction in nitrogen and potash use per bushel of corn grain harvested, respectively). A 6.5% increase in ethanol yield, from 2.70 to 2.86 gal/bushel corn (0.402 to 0.427 L kg−1 corn), and a 24% reduction in ethanol plant energy use, from 32 000 to 25 000 Btu/gal ethanol (9.0 to 6.9 MJ L−1 ethanol) also helped reduce the CI. The total GHG emission reduction benefits through the reduction in the CI and increased ethanol production volume are estimated at 140 million metric tons (MMT) from 2005 to 2019 in the ethanol industry. Displacement of petroleum gasoline by corn ethanol in the transportation fuel market resulted in a total GHG emission reduction benefit of 544 MMT CO2e during the period 2005 to 2019. © 2021 Argonne National Laboratory.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to build the first Energy and Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) comparison between buses with internal combustion engine currently used in the city of Rosario, Province of Santa Fe, Argentina, and some technological alternatives and their variants focusing on buses with an electrical engine powered by compressed hydrogen that feet fuel cells of polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM). This LCA comprehend raw material extraction up to its consumption as fuel. Specifically, hydrogen production considering different production processes from renewable sources called “green hydrogen” (Velazquez Abad and Dodds, 2020) [1] and non-renewable sources called “grey hydrogen” (Velazquez Abad and Dodds, 2020) [1]. Renewable sources for hydrogen production are rapid cut densified poplar energy plantation, post-industrial wood residues such as chips pallets, and maize silage. For non-renewable hydrogen production sources are the local electrical power grid from water electrolysis and natural gas from the steam methane reforming process. Buses whose fuel would be renewable hydrogen, produced near the City of Rosario, Province of Santa Fe, Argentina, meet one of the main criteria of sustainability biofuels of the European Union (EU) taken into account Renewable Energy Directive (RED) 2009/28 [2] and EU RED Directive 2018/2001 [3] that need significant reduction on net greenhouse gases (GHG) from biomass origin row material respect fossil fuels. At least 70% of GHG would be avoided from its main fossil counterpart of the intern combustion engine (ICE), in the worst and current scenario of the emission factor of the electrical grid of Argentina in the point of use that is about 0.40 kg CO2eq/kWh with energy and environmental load of 100% in the allocation factor in the hydrogen production stage of the LCA analysis. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - This research work comprehensively investigates the different strategies on in-cylinder and after-treatment to reduce emissions in diesel engines under RCCI operation using ‘Fuel of Future’ Hydrogen and madhuca longifolia (ML) oil as primary and pilot fuels. The study used CRDI integrated with an open ECU system. Online injection timing/pressure variation, split injection, nano-emulsion, hydrogen-based RCCI mode, and cooled EGR techniques were implemented to extend the emissions to EURO-VI or BS-VI emission norms. The online optimized injection timing and pressure of ML operation improved the smoke emissions by 33% and 24%; HC emissions by 10% and 7%; CO emissions by 23% and 11%. With these optimized conditions, the pilot injection was splited as SPLIT-1 and 2 with three different spilt ratios (20:80, 30:70, 40:60). Also, 100 ppm graphene oxide emulsified with ML (NEM100) improved the smoke, HC, and CO emissions by 50%, 31%, and 35% respectively with optimized injection parameters. Amazingly, it was further reduced by 69%, 51%, and 64% under the hydrogen RCCI mode of operation. According to calculations and measurements, this research work successfully extended the emissions such as NOx, HC, and CO to 0.9, 1, and 1 g/kWh which are closer or equal to EURO-VI norms. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study aimed to analyze a heavy-duty tractor diesel engine operating on diesel-biodies-bioethanol blends using exergetic, economic, and environmental life cycle assessment analyses. Diesel was mixed with biodiesel and bioethanol with volumetric ratios of 5–15% and 2–6%, respectively. Nine diesel–biodiesel-bioethanol blends and one baseline fuel were tested at different PTO shaft speeds ranging from 800 to 1000 rpm under full load operating conditions. Various exergetic, economic, and environmental indicators were computed to facilitate decision-making on fuel composition and PTO shaft speed. In general, increasing biodiesel concentration in the fuel blend could improve the exergetic, economic, and environmental indicators of the system. However, there was no clear pattern of the effects of bioethanol on the investigated indicators. Interestingly, most of the prepared fuel blends were exergetically, economically, and environmentally superior to diesel. The lowest weighted environmental impact (52.1 mPts/GJ) and PTO shaft power generation cost (0.18 USD/kWh) were found for the fuel blend containing 10 vol% biodiesel and 4 vol% bioethanol at the PTO shaft speed of 1000 rpm. This fuel blend also showed the highest resource utilization efficiency (29.3%) and environmental sustainability (26.1%) at the PTO shaft speed of 1000 rpm. The weighted environmental impact and PTO shaft power generation cost of the selected fuel blend were 44.3% and 46.2% lower than those of diesel, respectively. The resource utilization efficiency and environmental sustainability of the selected fuel blend were 97.3% and 99.8% higher than those of diesel, respectively. Overall, substituting a portion of diesel with biodiesel and bioethanol was proved to be an attractive strategy from the exergetic, economic, and environmental perspectives. The results obtained can be valuable in practical applications to enhance the sustainability and viability of power production in agricultural activities. The applied exergetic, economic, and environmental methodologies appear to be reliable and comprehensive tools for assessing the whole-life sustainability and viability of mineral-biofuel blends. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In order to achieve the goal of a carbon neutral EU by 2050 and meet the climate targets of the Paris Agreement, a sustainable, efficient, competitive and secure energy system needs to be developed. This paper presents the synthesis of sustainable renewable energy supply networks within the EU-27, proposing a stepwise energy transition in the transport and power sectors, achieving a carbon net neutral target by 2050. A multi-period mixed-integer programming model is developed, with the objective of maximizing sustainability net present value, considering different biomass and waste resources for the production of biofuels, renewable electricity, hydrogen, food and bioproducts, employing different types of technologies. The results show that, with further development of existing technologies, the goal of a carbon-neutral EU can be achieved without compromising food production. Wind farms have proven to be the most promising solution at present for the rapid expansion of electricity generation from renewable energy sources, while the importance of solar photovoltaics is increasing over the years, reaching the 43% share of electricity generation from RES in 2050. Moreover, the energy transition within the EU could have a significant positive impact on the economic, environmental and also social aspects of sustainability, with more than 1.5 million new job opportunities created across the EU over the next 30 years. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel, the most suitable diesel fuel alternative, is currently gaining popularity due to its advantages and potential environmental protection. Besides, one of the environmental sustainability approaches in biodiesel production process would be the reuse of biomass waste. In this regard, this work focuses on sustainability and environmental factor assessment of waste cooking oil biodiesel production and the application of artificial neural networks to predict the biodiesel yield and its engine characteristics. The artificial neural network model was developed to predict the biodiesel yield, engine performance, and emission characteristics. It was observed that biodiesel production with 1% (wt/wt) catalyst concentration, 9:1 methanol to waste cooking oil molar ratio, 60 min reaction time with 500 rpm mixing intensity generates lesser wastes, and the process exhibits positive environmental impacts. In the process of predicting the biodiesel yield, the overall regression coefficient was calculated as 0.98. Moreover, in case of biodiesel fueled engine characteristics, the overall regression coefficient was computed as 0.99. It is disclosed from the analysis that artificial neural networks are excellent tools to simulate and predict the biodiesel produced from waste cooking oil and its engine characteristics. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To understand the catalytic upgrading of bio-oil over char-based catalyst, pyrolysis of pine sawdust with various char catalysts under different reaction temperatures was performed in a fixed-bed reactor, from which the liquid product was analyzed with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The main pyrolytic liquids were ketones and acids in the non-catalytic pyrolysis run, which were mainly derived from the pyrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose in biomass by ring opening and side chain cracking reactions, while the relative content of phenolic substances obtained from catalytic reaction at 400 °C over CO2-activated char increased from 33.79% to 78.12% with the increasing char activation time from 0.5 to 2.0 h, resulting from the formation of more multiple active sites (including surface active groups and the pore characteristics) on activated char. When the catalytic reaction temperature reached 600 °C, the quality of the bio-oil was further improved since the relative content of aromatic hydrocarbons increased from 7.30% to 21.04% at the expense of elimination of some oxygen-containing compounds (e.g., ketones, acids, aldehydes, etc). Furthermore, the content of phenol in phenolic compounds increased from 26–64% to 51–97%. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Global concerns over environmental issues raised several efforts to find an applicable alternative solution. One of the vital solutions is to promote liquid bio-refinery products as a transportation fuel. Bioethanol, considered the most common in this category, has several advantages that can help to protect the environment. However, nowadays, the production of this fuel, due to its high level of energy requirement, is not cost-effective in many countries. The current research aims to conduct Energy analysis to be used throughout finding optimum points for bioethanol production energy usage in separate sectors while production is under process. Results show 70% of the total required energy for the procedure is used in distillation columns for the production of 99.54 wt.% bioethanol. The distillation unit includes beer and rectification columns. In the current study, it was found that for the beer distillation column, the best combination for energy consumption reduction is a column with 32 trays in which the feed is inserted on tray 5, and the side stream is received from tray 9. It should be noted that the counting of trays is from top to bottom. Furthermore, for the rectification column, the arrangement of 45 trays should be maintained and the feed should be inserted on a tray between 15 and 30 from top to bottom so that the best results could be garnered with minimal energy consumption. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The contamination of soils by oily compounds has several environmental impacts, which can be reversed through bioremediation, using biosurfactants as auxiliaries in the biodegradation process. In this study, we aimed to perform ex situ bioremediation of biodiesel-contaminated soil using biosurfactants produced by Bacillus methylotrophicus. A crude biosurfactant was produced in a whey-based culture medium supplemented with nutrients and was later added to biodiesel-contaminated clayey soil. The produced lipopeptide biosurfactant could reduce the surface tension of the fermentation broth to 30.2 mN/m. An increase in the microbial population was observed in the contaminated soil; this finding can be corroborated by the finding of increased CO2 release over days of bioremediation. Compared with natural attenuation, the addition of a lower concentration of the biosurfactant (0.5% w/w in relation to the mass of diesel oil) to the soil increased biodiesel removal by about 16% after 90 days. The added biosurfactant did not affect the retention of the contaminant in the soil, which is an important factor to be considered when applying in situ bioremediation technologies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Tin zirconium oxide catalysts (Sn-based TMOs) were successfully prepared with three different methods, ultrasonic-assisted hydrothermal, sol-gel, and traditional precipitation method, and applied for biodiesel production. The physicochemical and the catalytic efficiency by the esterification of stearic acid of the as-synthesized catalysts were investigated by different techniques. The production of biodiesel (as methyl stearate) has emerged as a greener and renewable substitute for petro based diesel fuel. The optimization of the esterification conditions for maximum yield of biodiesel was performed by studying different factors as the catalyst preparation method, reaction time, molar ratio of alcohol to stearic acid, reaction temperature, and the catalyst concentration. The preferred catalyst (SnZrh) was optimized as the reaction temperature of 120 °C, 150 M ratio of methanol to stearic acid, 0.2 g catalyst amount and reaction time of 60 min. The SnZrh catalyst exhibited 74% yield of methyl stearate. Also, the kinetic and thermodynamic studies of stearic acid esterification reaction were inspected. The reusability of the optimized tin zirconium oxide catalyst for seventh runs was professionally studied. The computational chemistry study showed that the interaction mechanism between the optimized catalyst and stearic acid was preferable between SnO2 active sites and carbonic group of stearic acid. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Solid-liquid equilibrium (SLE) is essential for some separation processes in chemical industries. SLE for hydrocarbon mixtures, biofuels, phase change materials (PCM) or deep eutectic solvents (DES) are current topics in literature. Most common study involves binary systems and very often eutectic points are presented. A new method has been developed to determine the solid–liquid equilibrium and the eutectic compositions of hydrocarbon binary systems. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and numerical integration are combined and only two DSC analyses are required. A deconvolution procedure with Asymmetric Double Sigmoidal (ADS) equation is proposed to analyse the peaks individually when the thermogram peaks overlap. The ADS equation produced the most accurate fit for five different DSC peaks. The new method was successfully validated against the conventional method by comparing fourteen samples from four eutectic binary systems (naphthalene/n-tetracosane, naphthalene/n-octacosane, p-xylene/n-hexadecane and n-octane/1-methyl-naphthalene). Uncertainty analysis carried out for the new method leads to SLE data errors of 0.612 K and 0.011 for temperature and mole fraction, respectively. The new method for the calculation of compositions, masses and eutectic points was applied for several samples of each system. The SLE and eutectic data obtained were compared with the conventional method, achieving standard deviations of 2.23 K and 0.04 for temperature and mole fraction, respectively. The new method can save at least a 50% of the experimental time and its associated resources compared to the conventional method. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Anisole and benzyl alcohol, both are lignin based oxygenated aromatic biofuels as a pair of isomers with benzene rings possessing different oxygen functional groups. This work investigated the characteristics of soot formation in laminar co-flow diffusion flames with n-heptane and its blends with anisole and benzyl alcohol from atmospheric to elevated pressures. With the high-pressure burner and pressurized Twin-Lines liquid fuel evaporization (TLLFE) system, a series of experiments were carried out to measure the sooting tendency by utilizing the Laser induced incandescence (LII) combining with Line-of-sight attenuation (LOSA) technique. The experimental results show that with the addition of anisole and benzyl alcohol, the soot formation in flames is enhanced, especially for the addition of benzyl alcohol. Moreover, the elevated pressure can enhance the soot formation in n-heptane and n-heptane/anisole flames, and the integrated soot volume fractions (SVFs) follow power law relationships with pressure. The power dependence on pressure for n-heptane/anisole flame is larger in comparison with that of n-heptane flame. These findings provide basic understanding of the soot formation in co-flow laminar diffusion flames of n-heptane and oxygenated aromatic biofuels. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, biochar and bio-oil were produced from the sewage sludge of cosmetics industry effluent treatment plant via pyrolysis under N2 atmosphere, at 500 and 600 °C and 30 and 60 min. The biochar presented micrometric particles with a porous structure, with a surface area between 203 and 231 m2 g-1 and amorphous aspect containing crystalline quartz structures. The superior calorific power (SCP) for different biochar was 5.9-7.6 MJ kg-1. Bio-oils presented fatty acids, alcohols and esters with long aliphatic chains as main constituents. The SCP of these materials showed a high value (41 MJ kg-1), with the possibility to be used as a precursor for the biofuels production. The biochar, was applied as an adsorbent for the methylene blue (MB) dye from aqueous system. The adsorption parameters such as contact time (0-120 min), adsorbent dosage (0.25-1.0 g L-1) and initial pH (5-9.5) were studied. Kinetics and adsorption isotherm studies were also carried out. Pseudo-second order and Langmuir isotherm models fit the data better, showing adsorption maximum amount of 51 mg g-1 at 45 °C. The MB removal by biochar is an endothermic process and the material can be reactivated and reused. From the results, it can be concluded that the sludge from the cosmetic industry can be used as raw material to obtain new products with added value, such as biochar and bio-oil. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The present study is dealt with the phenomenon of combustion for rice bran oil (RBO) methyl ester blends with diesel along with nanoparticles of magnelium. Nanoparticles composition of 25 ppm, 50 ppm, and 75 ppm are added to blends of B20, B40, and B60 in the study. A conversion rate of 89.64 ± 2.8% is observed during the transesterification reaction performed at 5 wt% of potassium hydroxide (KOH) catalyst, 10:1 alcohol to oil ratio (methanol), 75 °C reaction temperature, and 60 min reaction time. During the combustion study, few samples displayed the puffing characteristics, which are caused by popping of bubbles at lower pressure. The summary of the present study suggested that blend B20 with 25 ppm nanoparticles has the potential to be used as fuel and further proposed that the fuel will be more economical if the injection droplet diameter is 0.77 mm. Other blends like B20 with 75 ppm are also likely to be used as fuel due to its exhibition of lesser threat towards combustion. Bubble formation followed by micro-explosion is observed in B60 with 25 ppm blend. The present study hoped to enrich future researchers working in similar area for signifying the importance of understanding droplet combustion of biofuels. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Catalytic properties of the tungstated alumina (WA) supported catalysts with different nature and content of active metal (Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru, Ni) were studied in the continuous flow hydrodeoxygenation of sorbitol at a temperature of 653 K, a pressure of 4.0 MPa, and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 1.0 h−1. The catalysts were characterized by N2 physical adsorption, H2-TPR, CO chemisorption, TEM, and NH3-TPD. It was found that all catalysts provide complete conversion of sorbitol with the formation of C5–C7 hydrocarbons as the main products which include n-alkanes, cycloalkanes, and isoalkanes. The yield of С5–С7 hydrocarbons after 1 h of the reaction increases from 42 to about 74 mol% in a series of catalysts: 5% Ni/WA &lt; 0.5% Ru/WA &lt; 0.5% Pd/WA &lt; 0.5% Rh/WA &lt; 0.5% Pt/WA. The calculated value of the research octane number (RON) for the С5–С7 mixture rises from ca. 62 to 80 in a series of catalysts: 0.5% Pt/WA &lt; 0.5% Pd/WA &lt; 0.5% Rh/WA &lt; 5% Ni/WA &lt; 0.5% Ru/WA. The stable yield and RON values (no less than 57 mol% and 70, respectively) of С5–С7 hydrocarbon mixture are achieved during hydrodeoxygenation over the 0.5% Pd/WA catalyst for 8 h. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Methanogenic bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) can convert carbon dioxide (CO2) to methane (CH4) and may be used for anaerobic digester biogas upgrading. However, the effect of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a common biogas component, on BES performance is unknown. Thus, the objective of this study was to assess the effect of H2S addition to the cathode headspace on BES performance at a range of initial gas-phase H2S concentrations (0–6% v/v), as well as its effect on the anode and cathode microbial communities. As the initial cathode headspace H2S increased from 0 to 2% (v/v), biocathodic CH4 production increased by two-fold to 3.56 ± 0.36 mmol/L-d, due to dissolved H2S transport from the cathode to the anode where H2S was oxidized. Elemental sulfur and sulfate were H2S oxidation products detected in the anode. Above 3% initial cathode headspace H2S, biocathodic CH4 production declined due to inhibition. A phylotype most closely related to Methanobrevibacter arboriphilus dominated the cathode archaeal communities. In the sulfide-amended BES, a phylotype similar to the exoelectrogen Ochrobactrum anthropi was enriched in both the anode and cathode, whereas phylotypes related to sulfate-reducing and sulfur oxidizing Bacteria were detected in the bioanode. Thus, sulfide transport and oxidation in the anode play an important role in methanogenic BESs treating sulfide-bearing biogas. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Compressed biogas (CBG) has proven to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to fossil diesel, but due to diverging methodologies, results of different studies lie far apart. The usage of the co-produced digestate can lead to high acidification and eutrophication impacts, but this aspect is often not considered, neither is the way different substitution methods for the digestate affect the results. In this work we address these issues performing a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of CBG production through anaerobic digestion of animal manure and municipal organic waste (MOW). GHG savings of 93%–131% compared to the fossil diesel benchmark in the Renewable Energy Directive were found, thus complying with the 60% reduction target. The ammonia emissions during the digestate application make acidification and terrestrial eutrophication the main environmental burdens of CBG from MOW, leading to a 142% and a 715% increase for acidification and terrestrial eutrophication respectively, compared to fossil diesel. When CBG is produced from manure and the avoidance of manure storage emission is considered, a 257% and a 700% lower acidification and terrestrial eutrophication impact was found. Our results suggest that better manure-storage techniques are required and that field emissions due to digestate application, which is sensitive to pH and nitrogen content, should be reduced. It was further demonstrated that including the digestate fertilizing emissions in the system boundaries of the LCA of CBG production and substitution of both mineral fertilizer production and usage have a great impact on the outcome, but also introduce uncertainty of the results. The outcome of this work was used to suggest recommendations on the methodology for future LCA studies on CBG production and EU biofuel regulations. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Automotive engines are encouraged to utilize biofuels to lower the net CO2 and to enhance the usage of renewable energy. With well-proven biodiesel engine characteristics, a comprehensive study about the impact of biodiesel on the fuel filter is lacking in the literature. Hence the current study investigates the comparative impact of higher blends of biodiesel and diesel on the fuel filter. Here, the authors have conducted both experimental and simulation studies on the fuel filter with diesel, two biodiesel fuels namely karanja, and waste cooking oil. Filter blocking tendency (FBT) was measured for the test fuels following ASTM D2068. Also, a comparative tensile strength analysis of an automotive filter media was examined. The test results reveal that FBT increases exponentially with an increase in biodiesel blend concentration with a maximum FBT value of 30 for karanja biodiesel. Further, the tensile strength of the filter media reduces significantly with soaking in biodiesel compared to fossil diesel. Filter pressure drop measurement results with biodiesel were observed to be 35% higher than diesel. Consequently, effective countermeasures such as fuel preheating, varying the filtration area and ethanol blending are proposed to reduce the filter pressure drop with biodiesel. Filter pressure drop with karanja can be reduced similar to diesel fuel by increasing the fuel temperature by 16 °C or enhancing the filtration area by 35%. Karanja blended with 20% ethanol was also observed to have lowered the pressure drop. The present study concludes that neat biodiesel operation affects the filtration process and the filter media of the conventional fuel filter significantly. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, the production of renewable hydrocarbons was explored by the means of waste cottonseed oil (WCSO) micropyrolysis at 500◦C. Catalytic upgrading of the pyrolysis vapors was studied using α-Al2O3, γ-Al2O3, Mo-Co/γ-Al2O3, and Mo-Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. The oxygen removal efficiency was much lower in non-catalytic pyrolysis (18.0%), whilst γ-Al2O3 yielded a very high oxygen removal efficiency (91.8%), similar to that obtained with Mo-Co/γ-Al2O3 (92.8%) and higher than that attained with Mo-Ni/γ-Al2O3 (82.0%). Higher conversion yields into total renewable hydrocarbons were obtained with Mo-Co/γ-Al2O3 (61.9 wt.%) in comparison to Mo-Ni/γ-Al2O3 (46.6%). GC/MS analyses showed a relative chemical composition of 31.3, 86.4, and 92.6% of total renewable hydrocarbons and 58.7, 7.2, and 4.2% of oxygenated compounds for non-catalytic bio-oil (BOWCSO), BOMoNi and BOMoCo, respectively. The renewable hydrocarbons that were derived from BOMoNi and BOMoCo were mainly composed by olefins (35.3 and 33.4%), aromatics (31.4 and 28.9%), and paraffins (13.8 and 25.7%). The results revealed the catalysts’ effectiveness in FFA decarbonylation and decarboxylation, as evidenced by significant changes in the van Krevelen space, with the lowest O/C ratio values for BOMoCo and BOMoNi (O/C = 0–0.10) in relation to the BOWCSO (O/C = 0.10–0.20), and by a decrease in the presence of oxygenated compounds in the catalytic bio-oils. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Microalgal treatment of undiluted raw piggery wastewater is challenging due to ammonia toxicity and a deep dark color hampering photosynthesis. To overcome these problems, (1) a microalga (Coelastrella sp.) was isolated from an ammonia-rich environment, (2) the wastewater treatment was divided into two steps: a heterotrophic process followed by a mixotrophic process, and (3) a narrower transparent photobioreactor was employed with higher light intensity in the mixotrophic process. Coelastrella sp. removed 99% of ammonia, 92% of chemical oxygen demand (COD), and 100% of phosphorus during the 4-day process. Acetate in the wastewater relieved the ammonia stress on microalgae and promoted algal lipid and triacylglycerol productivity. Oxidative stability and low-temperature fluidity of triacylglycerols in lipids were improved by means of an altered fatty acid profile. Aside from the overall microalgal treatment performance, the proposed processing of piggery wastewater yielded a material suitable for possible production of algal biodiesel of better quality. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, the compatibility and corrosion behavior of carbon steel, stainless steel, aluminum and copper in contact with blends composed of biodiesel (consisting of soybean oil, beef tallow and swine lard) and petrodiesel were evaluated. Static immersion tests (total, partial and crevice) and exposure in vapor phase were carried out for 2160 h at 50 °C. Our main findings indicate that fuel blends influence the corrosion behavior, being observed a less corrosive attack on the materials, except for copper that presented an anomalous corrosion behavior, with a clear trend towards lower corrosion rates. Carbon steel and stainless steel in total, partial and crevice tests presented surface morphology with slightly changes, while carbon steel exposed in vapor phase showed corrosive attack. Copper presented the highest corrosion rates in partial (9.5273 μm/y), total (9.1484 μm/y) and crevice (6.6178 μm/y) tests in the B7 blend, respectively; and the lowest corrosion rates in total (0.0547 μm/y) for the B15 blend; in partial (0.4926 μm/y) and crevice (0.0182 μm/y) tests for the B30 blend. Among the materials evaluated, copper showed higher influence on biodiesel oxidative stability. Aluminum exhibited good compatibility and did not show any compound formed on its surface without presenting any corrosion. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Present study presents the results of methyl esters preparation from Jatropha-Algae oil using transesterification process. In this study, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and the response surface methodology (RSM) based Box–Behnken techniques were used for modelling and analysis of different parameters viz molar ratio, temperature, reaction time, and catalyst concentration in biodiesel production process. Significant regression model with R2value of 0.9867 was obtained under a molar ratio of 6–12, KOH of 0–2% w/w, time of 60–180 min and temperature of 35–55 °C using RSM. The ANFIS model was used to individually correlate the output variable (biodiesel yield) with four input variables with R2 value of 0.9998. Finally, a study investigating the performance and emissions of a diesel engine fuelled with biodiesel blends (B0, B5, B10 and B20 vol%) has been performed concluding significant reduction of emission. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - One of the dominating meat supply industries, the poultry chicken sector, is facing waste management concerns worldwide. Due to high oil content containment, biofuel researchers emphasized poultry waste as abundant, cheap, and high-quality feedstock for biodiesel production. Therefore, in the current study, an experimental investigation of biodiesel production from wasted chicken skin through the transesterification process has been performed. The chicken skin used in this study for biodiesel production can be used as the potential waste source for biodiesel production worldwide. Techno-economic, environmental, and sustainability analyses were also performed. During the synthesis, the reaction was conducted with potassium hydroxide (KOH), and the process yielded 48% biodiesel. The cost of electricity for providing electricity is estimated at US$0.575 per kWh when an auto-sized generator has been fueled by biodiesel. The environmental and substantiality analysis found that biodiesel is more suitable than conventional diesel as an environmentally friendly and sustainable fuel. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The activity of mesoporous Al-MCM-41 for deoxygenation ofReutealis trispermaoil (RTO) was enhancedviamodification with NiO nanoparticles. Deoxygenation at atmospheric pressure and under H2free conditions required acid catalysts to ensure the removal of the oxygenated fragments in triglycerides to form liquid hydrocarbons. NiO at different weight loadings was impregnated onto Al-MCM-41 and the changes of Lewis/Brønsted acidity and mesoporosity of the catalysts were investigated. The activity of Al-MCM-41 was enhanced when impregnated with NiO due to the increase of Lewis acidity originating from NiO nanoparticles and the mesoporosity of Al-MCM-41. Increasing the NiO loading enhanced the Lewis acidity but not Brønsted acidity, leading to a higher conversion towards liquid hydrocarbon yield. Impregnation with 10% of NiO on Al-MCM-41 increased the conversion of RTO to hydrocarbonsviathe deoxygenation pathway and reduced the products from cracking reaction, consequently enhancing the green diesel (C11-C18) hydrocarbon products. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

AB  - Ships, which are the backbone of world trade, are also major emission generators. IMO has prepared a regulation that came into force on January 1, 2020, in particular to reduce ship-related sulphur oxides. Accordingly, the sulphur content of the marine fuels cannot exceed 0.5% by mass. Although these fuels have a significant effect in reducing the sulphur oxides, the holistic environmental effects of the fuels must be examined within a life cycle perspective. In this study, LCA of four different marine fuels were realized and the environmental impacts of the fuels in production, distribution, and operation processes were investigated. The main purpose of this study is to increase precision by focusing on a small number of fuels, while increasing accuracy by obtaining a large number of LCA results. It is concluded that despite the success of low sulphur fuels during operation, the overall environmental effects are higher than other fuels. According to the LCA results, there are no significant differences between the fuels and HFO still remains an important and preferable fuel for the environment. Consequently, in life cycle perspective, it was concluded that the expected results of IMO 2020 Sulphur Cap are not at a desirable level. Thus, alternative fuels would be more beneficial in terms of total environmental issues and IMO should focus more on developing new regulations and policies on alternative fuels. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The promoting action of W in the Ni-Al2O3 co-precipitated catalysts with high nickel loading (31–46 wt% Ni) has been investigated in the selective deoxygenation of sunflower oil and waste cooking oil towards green diesel production. A WNi-Al2O3 catalyst containing 8 wt% W and 35 wt% Ni ([Formula presented] atomic ratio) proven the most efficient. The detailed characterization of the catalysts allowed an insight concerning the tungsten promoting action. It was attributed to the increase in the catalyst specific surface area and metallic nickel surface area, the acidity regulation, the decrease of the amount of catalytically inactive nickel aluminate formed and to the participation of W5+-oxo species via their defect oxygen sites in the selective deoxygenation network. The optimum reduction – activation temperature was found at 500 °C, where a good compromise between the increase of metallic Ni relative amount, the decrease of the specific surface area and the increase of Ni mean crystal size is achieved. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hydrothermal treatment (HT) is a promising method to convert sewage sludge to hydrochar biofuel. The heating value is directly correlated to the carbon content in hydrochar; however, the release of organic matter from sludge to hydrolysate and the transfer of the Maillard reaction products generated in the hydrolysate to the solid phase alter the carbon content in hydrochar. In this study, the relationship between hydrolysate and heating value of sludge-based hydrochar was presented, aiming to explain how the calorific value of hydrochar was affected by HT conditions. We adopted a direct combustion test to verify its clean combustion features. Hydrochar derived at 260 °C and residence time of 4 h (HC 260-4) exhibited the highest calorific value (HHVdaf = 26.23 MJ/kg) with an energy density of 1.43, and its fuel characteristics were similar to those of lignite. The increase in the HT temperature and residence time up to 260 °C and 4 h, respectively, was beneficial for enhancing HHVdaf. Conversely, further increase of the HT temperature to 300 °C and HT time to 6 h yielded a decrease in HHVdaf. Investigation of the underlying mechanism revealed that the protein and polysaccharide releasing from sludge to hydrolysate occurred the Maillard reaction (MR). The generated humic-like Maillard reaction product (MRP) was transferred to hydrochar, inducing an increase in the carbon content and calorific value and a decrease in the organic content of hydrolysate. As the carbohydrate content in the hydrolysate decreased, the MR was terminated, so no more MRP was transferred to hydrochar. At the same time, the protein was still continuously released at higher temperatures and longer residence times, yielding a decline in the HHVdaf. Moreover, clean energy utilization was verified from the reduced nitrogen content in hydrochar and lower CO and NOx emission of HC 260-4 in the combustion test. After the HT, increased hydrophobicity and a lower fraction of bound water improved the dewaterability, which is of great significance for applying hydrochar as biofuel. The findings of this study provided a new perspective to explain the heating value generation of hydrochar and more direct evidence to assess its clean combustion properties, with promising perspectives for practical applications. © 2021

AB  - Hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO) is a renewable diesel fuel used to replace petroleum diesel. The organic compounds in HVO are poorly characterized; therefore, toxicological properties could be different from petroleum diesel exhaust. The aim of this study was to evaluate the exposure and effective biomarkers in 18 individuals after short-term (3 h) exposure to HVO exhaust and petroleum diesel exhaust fumes. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was used to analyze urinary biomarkers. A proximity extension assay was used for the measurement of inflammatory proteins in plasma samples. Short-term (3 h) exposure to HVO exhaust (PM1 ~1 µg/m3 and ~90 µg/m3 for vehicles with and without exhaust aftertreatment systems, respectively) did not increase any exposure biomarker, whereas petroleum diesel exhaust (PM1 ~300 µg/m3 ) increased urinary 4-MHA, a biomarker for p-xylene. HVO exhaust from the vehicle without exhaust aftertreatment system increased urinary 4-HNE-MA, a biomarker for lipid peroxidation, from 64 ng/mL urine (before exposure) to 141 ng/mL (24 h after exposure, p &lt; 0.001). There was no differential expression of plasma inflammatory proteins between the HVO exhaust and control exposure group. In conclusion, short-term exposure to low concentrations of HVO exhaust did not increase urinary exposure biomarkers, but caused a slight increase in lipid peroxidation associated with the particle fraction. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Energy demand is increasing continuously due to the progress of industrialization, the vehicular population of the world, and modernization in lifestyle. In the present study, Chlorella minutissima microalgae were cultured in a 1500 L raceway open pond using commercial fertilizer under semi-continuous mode. About 19.98 wt % lipid was extracted by the soxhlet extraction method from this microalgae biomass. To optimize the input reaction parameters (temperature, lipid to methanol ratio, microwave power, and reaction time) for improving transesterification yield, Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was employed. The output responses of the experiments were biodiesel yield along with density, kinematic viscosity, calorific value, cold flow properties, and oxidation stability. To validate the model, confirmation trials were carried out. All the fuel properties were found to be satisfying ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 standard specifications except for oxidation stability at 3.0 h. The oxidation stability was further improved by using appropriate antioxidants and improved up to 10.5 h with the addition of 1000 ppm propyl gallate. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is a promising feedstock for the synthesis of value-added chemicals and biofuels. However, one of the biggest challenges for producing high-quality diesel fuels is the lack of sufficient carbon-chain length in biomass derivatives. In this study, a C17 diesel precursor 1,1,1-tris(5-methyl-2-furyl)ethane (TEMF) with a yield of ca. 70% was synthesized from the cascade acetylation-hydroxyalkylation/alkylation of bio-based 2-methylfuran (MF) with acetic anhydride (AA) catalyzed by acid-treated montmorillonite with enhanced acidity and improved porosity. The catalytic mechanism of the cascade reaction process was investigated over different types of acid species (Brønsted acid and Lewis acid), and the influence of in situ formed acetic acid was also examined. A synergistic effect was observed to enable the synthesis of TEMF from the trimerization of MF with AA, in which Lewis acid and weak Brønsted acid species mainly catalyze the acetylation and hydroxyalkylation processes, while the subsequent alkylation step is mainly catalyzed by strong Brønsted acid. © 2020 The Chemical Industry and Engineering Society of China, and Chemical Industry Press Co., Ltd

AB  - Oleaginous biomass conversion to liquid hydrocarbon biofuels has emerged as an effective solution to the energy crisis and environmental problems. In this process, the removal of oxygenated compounds will directly affect the effectiveness of subsequent biofuel applications. Herein, deoxygenation of oleic acid by catalytic cracking was conducted using five various elements (La, Ni, P, Zr and Ce) modified Al-MCM-41. The related characterizations were carried out for these catalysts, including N2 physisorption, XRD, XPS, pyridine-FTIR and NH3-TPD techniques. The results showed the mesoporous structure of Al-MCM-41 was maintained after different modifications, and these catalysts greatly improved the hydrocarbons content and physiochemical properties of biofuels. The modified catalysts tended to facilitate the decarbonylation pathway and showed high selectivity to alkane and aromatic hydrocarbons. Besides, La/Al-MCM-41 presented excellent anti-coking activity. Ni/Al-MCM-41 showed both high dehydrogenation and deoxygenation activities. The Zr modification and Ce modification had a promotion effect in the deoxidizing activity of the catalyst, owing to the formation of oxophilic metal oxides. Noteworthily, P/Al-MCM-41 displayed the best deoxidizing performance due to its high Brönsted acidity, which caused the highest hydrocarbons content (82.30 %) and the lowest fatty acids content (around 0 %) of the biofuel. Moreover, the resulting biofuel had not only low oxygen content (3.88 wt.%) and acid value (5.47 mgKOH g−1) but also a high calorific value (44.50 MJ kg−1), which could be processed into green diesel. Hence, the catalytic cracking of fatty acid over P/Al-MCM-41 has excellent potential to produce high-quality renewable fuels. © 2021

AB  - In this work, the pyrolysis characteristics of waste clay oil were studied using thermogravimetric and reaction kinetic analysis. Additionally, the two temperature stages in the pyrolysis process of waste clay oil were analyzed. Furthermore, Py-GC-MS was used to analyze the main products of cracked volatiles at different pyrolysis temperatures, it showed that the higher pyrolysis temperature was beneficial to promote the decarboxylation reaction in the pyrolysis reaction. Also, it suggested the probable occurrence of cyclization reaction during the pyrolysis process. Based on the pyrolysis characteristics of waste clay oil, a fixed bed rapid pyrolysis experiment was carried out to explore the properties of pyrolysis products. Subsequently, the pyrolysis products of waste clay oil were analyzed by means of FTIR, NMR, GC-MS and GC-TCD/FID. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Integration of the biorefinery concept to the existing Kraft-pulping process is undertaken to achieve a more sustainable development. This paper aims at developing a novel biorefinery-integrated-Kraft-pulping network with improved profitability, energy self-sufficiency and minimum CO2 emission by employing technologies consisting of biofuel and biochemical productions, biomass gasification together with CO2 capture and utilization. Three scenarios, including (I) the production of gasification-based dimethyl ether (DME); (II) the co-production of DME and succinic acid; and (III) the co-production of DME and succinic acid coupled with the CO2 utilization, have been investigated. Among all scenarios, Scenario II exhibits the best economic performances as highlighted by the 74% increase of profit compared to the conventional process. Scenario III achieves the highest energy efficiency at 39% and an improved environmental performance due to the 65% reduction of CO2 emission compared to the conventional process with only 0.7% profit reduction. Comparing to the biorefinery-integrated-Soda-pulping networks proposed by the previous work, the biorefinery-integrated-Kraft-pulping networks show higher performance on both economic and environmental improvements. Thereby confirming that the integration of the biorefinery network can improve the sustainability and enhance the economic benefit of the Kraft-pulping process beyond the conventional process. © 2021

AB  - An integrated biorefinery concept for yeast-based biodiesel production using durian peel (DP) as a feedstock was developed. After dilute acid hydrolysis, DP hydrolysate (DPH) and DP solid fraction (DPSF) hydrolysis residues were generated. Yeast lipid was produced from undetoxified DPH by Rhodotorula mucilaginosa KKUSY14. DPSF was subjected to a one-step sulfonation process to prepare a solid catalyst (DPSF-SO3H) and was characterized using FTIR, XRD, and FE-SEM analysis. DPSF-SO3H catalyst exhibited good catalytic activity for yeast-based biodiesel (FAME) production from wet cell of KKUSY14 grown in DPH by direct transesterification. FAME yields of 81.57% and 78.73% were reached, respectively, for microwave and conventional heating. The fuel properties of FAME were in accordance with the ASTM and EN standards. Based on the higher heating value of FAME produced, an energy output of about 32.44–34.90 MJ/kg was estimated. The proposed bio-refinery concept led to the production of 101.2 kg yeast biomass, 16.0 kg yeast lipid, 717 kg DPSF-SO3H catalyst, 79.7–82.6 kg FAME, and 70.4 kg yeast residues from 1000 kg of DP waste. This model clearly provides economic benefits by creating value-added products and eliminating any waste streams. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Low temperature performance determines that the application area of biodiesel is one of the most important parameters for biodiesel. Therefore, establishing a model between biodiesel composition and low temperature performance can help manufacturers easily select or deploy raw materials. In this study, different ML methods were evaluated for the first time to establish a prediction model between biodiesel composition and CFPP. The DT-based methods has good performance in predicting CFPP of biodiesel. The stacking method was shown to have the best prediction results and stability via verification of ET, stacking and MLP methods on the test set. Importance analysis shows that palmitic acid has the greatest influence on DT-based methods. This work determind that the coefficient of determination of stacking method (R2&gt;0.90) is significantly improved compared to the existing CFPP prediction model (R2=0.87). It provides support for the next step in a wider range of verification and promotion. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A four-component skeletal mechanism consisting of 1,4-hexadiene, methyl decanoate, methyl trans-3-hexenoate, n-hexadecane was developed to represent biodiesel fuel from various sources. The methyl decanoate and n-hexadecane were selected to represent saturated fatty acid methyl esters, and trans-3-hexenoate and 1,4-hexadiene were applied to adjust degree of unsaturation. A skeletal mechanism for this four-component biodiesel surrogate fuel with PAH was first formulated based on decoupling methodology, which contained a detailed C1 mechanism, a reduced C2–C3 mechanism, PAH mechanism and sub-mechanisms of four surrogate fuels, including 314 reactions and 98 species. After that, the skeletal mechanism was widely verified against various fundamental combustion experiments for each pure component and their mixtures. Furthermore, the experimental results of biodiesel soot volume fractions from biodiesel spray combustion in a constant-volume combustion vessel were used to verify the accuracy of the mechanism, and the skeletal mechanism was also coupled into the CFD-software to simulate the combustion characteristics of a diesel engine. Results showed that the calculated results agreed well with the experimental data including ignition delay times (IDTs), primary species concentrations, laminar flame speed, soot prediction and in-cylinder pressure of the engine. Overall, the developed compact skeletal mechanism was suitable for the combustion simulation of biodiesel fuel. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bio-oil is produced as a promising fuel for improving the economics of biomass. However, bio-oil utilizations suffer from challenges due to its complex compositions. In this research three bio-oil samples (BSR, BPA and BFT) were blended with coal/char to prepare slurries as biofuels. The thermogravimetric analysis of combustion and ash compositions of biofuels were investigated. Results showed that bio-oils have more weight loss peaks than coal/char, and the Tm is concentrated in the range from 476.4 °C to 495.2 °C, which are much lower than char. The contribution of coal/char and bio-oils to biofuel blendings can be clearly seen in the combustion profiles. There is a synergistic effect between bio-oils and coal/char improving the combustion performance. Tb of lignite BSR slurry reduced up to around 40 °C in comparison with lignite. The temperature range for combustion became narrow. By blending BSR, the Ea of lignite, long flame coal and char reduced 5.65 kJ mol−1, 13.56 kJ mol−1 and 6.31 kJ mol−1, respectively. Lignite BSR slurry with the lowest activation energy presented best combustion characteristics among all biofuels. The improved performance may attribute to AAEMs contained in bio-oil and microexplosions occurred in combustion, and AAEMs also help form lower fusion temperature of ashes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - These studies focuses on synthesizing of an efficient CaO-based-catalyst derived from the binary mixture of Lattorina littorea (periwinkles shell) and Mactra coralline (seashell), and apply it to transesterification of a quaternary mix of Carica papaya - Citrus sinesis- Hibiscus sabdariffa- Waste used. Details characterization of the developed catalyst was carried out using SEM, FTIR, and XRD to establish its catalytic potential. Process parameters optimization for the transesterification process was carried out to determine the optimum yield of biodiesel from oil blend. Lattorina littorea and Mactra coralline were made into powder by milling after drying, the powdered were mixed in the same ratio to obtain a developed catalyst before characterization. Oil was extracted from Carica papaya, Citrus sinesis, Hibiscus sabdariffa seed powder through solvent extraction method, the extracted oil was mixed in quaternary ratio with waste used oil, the properties of the mixed oil was determined before the transesterification with ethanol. Process optimization was carried using response surface methodology (RSM) coupled with central composite design (CCD) by considering four independent variables (reaction time, derived calcined catalyst powder (DCCP) amount, reaction temperature, and EtOH/OMR). The catalyst recyclability test was carried out, and the biodiesel quality was determined through physicochemical properties. The results showed 25:25:25:25 quaternary blend produced oil with low viscous and high volatility. Thermal treatment of a developed catalyst (DP) from Lattorina littorea mix with Mactra coralline, at 900 °C for 3 h produced CaO of 99.02 (% wt.) on XRD analysis result. The produced catalyst developed was re-used up to 3–cycles for base transesterification. The maximum experimental yield of 99.95 (% wt.) at a reaction time of 60 min, DCCP amount of 3.0 (g), reaction temperature of 70 °C, and EtOH/OMR of 6:1 (ml/ml), was obtained, but the statistical optimization predicted biodiesel yield of 99.8044 (wt. %) at a reaction time of 57.72 min, DCCP amount of 3.0 (g), reaction temperature of 69.54 °C, and EtOH/OMR of 6:1 (ml/ml), this yield was validated in triplicate and an average biodiesel yield of 99.7800 (%wt.) was obtained. Analysis of variance and the p-value showed that the selected variable factors were remarkably significant (p-value&lt;0.0001). Based on fit statistics and model comparison statistics, the coefficient of determination (R squared) of 99.84% was obtained with the predicted R2 of 99.06 in reasonable agreement with the adjusted R2 of 99.68. The quality of biodiesel produced was within the specification limits of biodiesel standard. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and H2 were produced from sesame cake in supercritical mixture of methanol and water using alumina supported CaO and MgO nanoparticles. The fresh and used catalysts were characterized by ICP-OES, BET, XRD, and TEM techniques. The significant influence of catalysts on the gas production was revealed. Further, the highest amounts of H2, CO, and CO2 was achieved by MgO/γ-Al2O3 with the hydrogen fraction more than 7.6 times, compared with the non-catalytic process. For biodiesel, CaO/γ-Al2O3 showed the best performance where 35.3% of the liquid product was FAMEs, more than 2.3 times relative to the non-catalytic process. In order to reduce the amounts of nitrogenate content in the liquid fuel, an efficient and scalable method implemented with the Soxhlet apparatus and the absorption tube equipped with CO2 gas flow system. Accordingly, the N-contents of the liquid products were reduced to highest degree of 65.2%, asserting that the reduced amount of the N-content strongly depends on the catalyst during the production process. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The transesterification of triglycerides is a critical step in biodiesel production. In this work, by loading boron-doped copper oxides onto SBA-15 mesoporous molecular sieve, an acid-base bifunctional catalyst (i.e., CunO-Bs/SBA-15) was prepared and applied to triglyceride transesterification. Compared with pure copper, sodium or boron oxides-based catalysts, CunO-Bs/SBA-15 enabled a higher biodiesel yield (>97.5%) at near room temperature (i.e., 40 °C) in 120 min. The characterization results showed that after B doping, the CunO-Bs/SBA-15 catalyst contained highly-dispersed acid-base sites without blocking the channels of porous SBA-15 support, which had good catalytic performance. Finally, in-situ DRIFTS was used to reveal the catalytic mechanism of the acid-base bifunctional groups of the as-prepared CunO-Bs/SBA-15 during transesterification. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work focuses on exctracting ethanol from waste pomegranate (Punica granatum) and the experimental investigation of impact of various mixtures on emissions and engine performance. Ethanol is produced through the fermentation process of waste pomegranate fruits. Four combinations, namely E10, E15, E20, and E25, were prepared and tested for various speeds with a wide open throttle at 10:1 compression ratio. As a result, it was found that the ethanol enrichment increased the fuel consumption and power for braking while the thermal efficiency decreased. CO-produced HC has decreased, but ethanol concentrations have increased the NOx and CO2 content emitted from the exhaust gas. The 1500RPM engine speed and the E15 combination revealed the optimal values of performance parameters among all the fuel combinations studied. © 2021, Islamic Azad University.

AB  - Sugarcane bagasse is an abundant residue from the ethanol/sugar industries and its liquefaction can be a low-cost process for the production of liquid biofuels. However, the resulting biocrude has high acidity, which requires an upgrading before being used. In this study, ethanol and fusel oil, which is the heavy residue of ethanol distillation made up of higher alcohols, were used as solvents for the liquefaction of bagasse. The 1:10 biomass:solvent ratio mixture was used at 300 °C for 30 min and (10 bar) N2 atmosphere. A mixture of both solvents was also tested to make a comparative study. The process with ethanol showed 72% bagasse conversion, but the best result showed 91% with fusel oil, producing a low biochar content (9%). After the distillation of the liquid product, a biocrude with high combustion heat (30.6 MJ.kg−1) and rich in esters was obtained. The results of GC/MS revealed the greater presence of esters with substituted isoamyl groups (51.2%) and, to a lesser extent, phenolic compounds (2.5%). The biochar has a higher heating value of 30 MJ.kg−1 and special thermal stability, suitable for application as a solid fuel. The biocrude was mixed with marine diesel (5%) and the properties of the mixture were evaluated, without relevant modifications. This innovative process showed the use of two residues, bagasse, and fusel oil, to produce a biofuel to be used with different types of diesel, with economic and environmental gains in a cycle economy for the ethanol industry. © 2020

AB  - Catalytic cracking of triglycerides over nanosized ZSM-5 (Nano-ZSM-5) and hierarchical ZSM-5 materials namely mesoporous ZSM-5 (Meso-ZSM-5) and nanosized ZSM-5/SBA-15 analog composite (Com-ZSM-5) was evaluated under fluid catalytic cracking conditions aiming to reduce the concentration of aromatics, especially benzene in the gasoline stream. The catalytic experiments were performed in a Single-Receiver Short-Contact-Time Microactivity Test unit (SR-SCT-MAT, Grace Davison) at 500 °C, catalyst-to-oil ratios of 0.3–1.0 (w/w) and contact time of 12 s. It was shown that the reduction of the ZSM-5 crystal size to nanometer (Nano-ZSM-5) or introduction of hierarchical porosity in ZSM-5 crystals (Meso-ZSM-5 and Com-ZSM-5) indeed improved the quality of gasoline by lowering the content of aromatics, particularly benzene. Compared to commercial ZSM-5, Meso-ZSM-5 and Nano-ZSM-5 produced more gasoline hydrocarbons while lowering the benzene content to ca. 2.0%, a relative decrease by ca. 50%. The advantage of Com-ZSM-5 over Meso-ZSM-5 and Nano-ZSM-5 was the lowest benzene level, i.e. ca. 0.8% which was below the permitted limit of less than 1% specified by the European regulation. The improved molecular transport along with the reduced density of strong Brønsted acid sites provided by the nanocrystalline and hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts might be responsible for their superior catalytic performance. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The processing of duckweed has been included in the list of promising pathways for biofuels production. This property is attributed to its simple manual harvesting method and its ability for high protein or starch content, depending on its species and growing environment. The biofuels production from duckweed, is not only a solution to energy and environmental problems, but also a reliable way to realize the utilization of duckweed. This critical review focuses on the bio-oil production from duckweed via pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction processes. First, characteristics and eco-environmental benefits of duckweed are reviewed. Next, the impacts of different parameters on the properties and distribution of bio-oil from pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction are discussed in detail. Subsequently, the effect of hydrogen donor solvents (as reaction media for upgrading) and catalysts on the upgrading of duckweed bio-oil are extensively discussed. This paper ends with the prospects for further development in thermochemical valorization of duckweed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper aims to evaluate the impact of cetane improvers on the combustion, performance and emission characteristics of a compression ignition engine fueled with a 20% peppermint bio-oil/diesel blend (P20). It is hypothesized that the low viscosity and boiling point of peppermint oil could improve the atomization characteristics of the fuel. However, the usage of peppermint oil is restricted due to its low cetane index. To improve this, Diethyl Ether (DEE) and Di-tertiary Butyl Peroxide (DTBP) are added to the P20 blend. The tests are performed in a single-cylinder naturally aspirated water-cooled diesel engine and results indicate that NOx emission for P20 + DEE and P20 + DTBP is decreased by 10.4% and 9.8%, respectively, when compared to P20 at full load condition. Among these two cetane improvers, DTBP is more effective in reducing the CO, HC and smoke emission and the performance of the engine was reported to be higher for P20 + DTBP blends. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Nowadays, most Italian biogas produces electricity even though recent political incentives are promoting biomethane from biogas by “upgrading” it. The aim of this paper is to focus on the regulatory framework for producing biomethane from new or already-existent anaerobic digestion plants. The complexity and lack of knowledge of the regulations on biofuel production and of anaerobic digested biomethane from waste and by-products create difficulties of both interpretation and application. Consequently, the aim of this paper is to analyze the regulations for producing biomethane, underline the critical issues and opportunities, and evaluate whether an electrical plant built in the last 10 years in Italy can really be converted to a biomethane plant, thereby lengthening its lifespan. Three case studies were considered to look more closely into applying Italian biomethane incentives and to simulate the types of incentivization in agriculture with examples based on certain fuel types typical of a standard biomethane plant of 500 standard cubic meter per hour. All the considered cases put in evidence that biomethane is a further opportunity for development with a high level of efficiency for all biogas producers, especially for many biogas plants whose incentivization period is about to finish. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Green biofuels are potential suggested solutions to pollutant emission issues and society's dependence on fossil derivatives for some time. Ethanol and biodiesel are renewable commercial fuels that are candidates for substituting fossil sources, especially in diesel engines, which are typically more efficient than spark-ignition engines. Ternary blends of diesel, biodiesel, and Ethanol form partial diesel replacement strategies applicable to diesel engines without the need for major adaptations. In this study, experimental evaluations were carried out in a multi-cylindrical diesel engine, supplied with diesel blends, Chlorella Vulgaris algae biodiesel (up to 20% in volumetric content), and anhydrous Ethanol (up to 20% in volumetric content). Each ternary blend is composed of different alcohol proportions and always with a volumetric concentration of 1% of a blend stabilizing additive. Therefore, the tests associate partial substitutions of diesel for biofuels with evaluations of engine performance and combustion of the blends under some load conditions, rotation regimes, and fuel injection instants. However, the search for optimized instants in fuel injection brought improvements to the engine's performance, allowed more advantageous energy conversions from Ethanol in diesel compared to spark ignition, in addition to minimizing the effects of Ethanol in delaying the beginning of combustion. To determine the effects of different ethanol proportions on efficiency when the CI engine is supplied with DBE mixtures, specific conditions of rotation, torque, and fuel injection moments were considered in the tests’ planning. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, various metal-modified zeolite beta-based catalysts such as La(10)zeo(90), Co(10)zeo(90), Fe(10)zeo(90), Mg(10)zeo(90), Mn(10)zeo(90) and Zn(10)zeo(90) were investigated in the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of oleic acid (OA) to produce renewable diesel. The La(10)zeo(90) catalyst showed a conversion of OA up to 99 % with 83 % C15 and C17 selectivity after the reaction at 350 °C for 2 h under 4 MPa H2 pressure. The superior activity of La(10)zeo(90) was attributed to the synergistic interaction between La-Si-Al, a sufficient amount of weak + medium acid sites and excellent textural properties (large pore diameter). Larger pore diameter of La(10)zeo(90) is highly desirable as it will generate greater diffusion of bulky molecules, thereby improving the accessibility of the reactant and hence excellent catalytic activity. The vacuum distillation was used to purify the crude liquid product (CLP), producing high-quality diesel fractions mainly comprising C14, C15, and C17 fractions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Lipase-mediated transesterification is a greener method for renewable biodiesel production, which can maintain high-level purity of the end products compared to the chemical transesterification methods. Hence, in this study, lipase was produced indigenously using Solid State Fermentation (SSF) from Rhizopus oryzae NRRL 3562, which was further immobilized on activated celite for transesterification. The evaluation of various transesterification attributes and stepwise optimizations were carried out for two different feedstock lipids, viz., a unialgal culture of Chlorella minutissima MCC 27, and a phyco-myco co-culture of C. minutissima MCC 27 and Aspergillus awamori. The optimal conditions, viz., 1:3–1:4 oil:methanol (molar ratio), 15 U lipase, 35 °-40 °C reaction temperature, 1% initial water loading, 1:0.4–1:0.6 substrate:hexane (w/v), 200–250 rpm agitation speed, and 30 h reaction duration ensued 91.52–93.25% fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) conversions in the selected microbial strains. The spent lipase showed potential for cyclic use and was found to have upheld almost 90% residual activity at the end of the 5th cycle. The two resultant biodiesels showed comparable fuel properties except a marginal alleviation in density, viscosity, and iodine value in case of C. minutissima MCC 27 and A. awamori co-culture biodiesel compared to C. minutissima biodiesel. © 2021

AB  - Catalytic esterification of fatty acids, such as oleic acid, is one of the most important chemical pathways for producing biofuels, and attention is now focused on looking for heterogeneous catalysts to avoid the defects of homogeneous catalysts. With this approach, an efficient Lewis acidic catalyst, Fe2(MoO4)3, was successfully prepared with definite crystalline morphology to catalyze the esterification reaction of oleic acid together with ethanol. Under optimum conditions (70 °C, 9 alcohol: 1 oleic molar ratio and 3% catalyst amount), the catalytic conversion of oleic acid to biodiesel was 90.5% and 92.5 in case of 5% catalyst, indicating that the combined catalyst has good catalytic activity. The kinetic study of ethanol–oleic acid esterification was conducted, as the kinetic study follows first-order kinetics with the calculated activation energy Ea = 25.21 kJ mol−1 and pre-exponential factor A0 = 2449.16 min−1. Thermodynamic showed a positive value of ΔH, ΔS, and ΔG (endothermic reaction). © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Current study was designed for developing the novel nano-biocatalyst (Lipase-PDA-TiO2 NPs) for enzymatic transesterification of Jatropha curcas seed oil (JCSO). The TiO2 NPs were prepared by the hydrothermal method and were afterward modified by the polydopamine (PDA) polymer. The synthesized nanomaterial was characterized by SEM, FTIR, XRD and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Lipase activity assay was used to check the stability of immobilized enzyme under varying conditions of pH and temperature. Transesterification of JCSO using Lipase-PDA-TiO2 NPs catalyst was optimized by response surface methodology (RSM). Optimum biodiesel yield (92%) was achieved by carrying out the transesterification process for 30 h at 37 °C temperature with 10% nano-biocatalyst concentration, 6:1 methanol:oil ratio and 0.5% water content. On the basis of model significance, R2 value, lack of fit test and predicted vs. actual values, quadratic model was selected as the best fitted model. The FTIR technique was utilized to monitor the transesterification process. The comparison of the physiochemical characteristics of the synthesized biodiesel with the international standard for bio-fuel affirms that the transesterification of JCSO in the presence of the nano-biocatalyst provides an effective alternative for the production of biodiesel. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Herein, we describe a three-step synthesis strategy starting with a chemical kinetics-governed one-pot two-step reaction. A series of biomass-derived molecules have been converted into ring-structured alkanes suitable for use as transportation fuels or jet fuels with high overall isolated yields of 68-90%. Various biomass-derived molecules can be used as starting materials, which include molecules with different functional groups such as carbonyl groups, benzene and furan rings, olefins, and so forth. Efficient and green reactions, including one-pot two-step reactions and solvent-free reactions, with common reagents and catalysts under mild reaction conditions or even under room temperature, were developed to produce bi(cyclopentane)-based biofuels with diversified and selective structures in good to excellent yields. The obtained products exhibit high densities of 0.87-0.94 g/cm3 and high net volumetric heating values of 38.3-41.4 MJ/L. Besides, they also have other fuel properties comparable to some well-known commercial synthetic fuels such as JET A, JET A-1, JET B, JP-10, and RJ-4. Some of the obtained biofuels have low freezing points of -58 and -80 °C. This general synthetic approach could be extended to a range of precursors with different carbon numbers, which allows the selective generation of high-energy content ring-structured alkanes with carbon numbers of C11-C26. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - We studied the thermal decomposition of dimethyl carbonate (DMC, C3H6O3) in a flash vacuum pyrolysis reactor in the 1100-1700 K range. The reaction products and intermediates were probed by vacuum ultraviolet synchrotron radiation in a photoelectron photoion coincidence (PEPICO) spectrometer to record isomer-specific photoion mass-selected threshold photoelectron (ms-TPE) spectra. Reaction pathways were explored using quantum chemical calculations, which confirmed the experimental observation that the intramolecular migration of a methyl group, yielding dimethyl ether (DME, C2H6O) and carbon dioxide, dominates the initial unimolecular decomposition chemistry. The role of a second potentially important channel, namely, C-O bond fission to yield methyl radicals, could not be determined experimentally due to the short lifetime of the ·C2H3O3 radical and overlapping sequential decomposition products. However, potential energy surface and microcanonical rate constant calculations predict 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower rates for this channel than for decarboxylation to yield DME. Consequently, DMC pyrolysis shows bewilderingly similar products and product abundances as DME pyrolysis. This coincides with DMC combustion modeling studies, which found that DME is a key intermediate in the mechanism. Furthermore, we have detected traces of methyl formate and formaldehyde, produced after the hydrogen shift to the central carbon atom in DMC. Ethylene and acetylene could be established as bimolecular reaction products because their abundance depended strongly on the DMC concentration. It is intriguing to compare the decomposition of DMC with that of the structurally similar methylal (dimethoxymethane, DMM). While methanol and formaldehyde are produced in similar quantities in DMM, thanks to low-energy hydrogen-transfer reactions, the methanol channel is almost fully suppressed in DMC due to the absence of hydrogens at the central carbon atom and the thermodynamically favored decarboxylation. These new mechanistic insights may help the development of predictive combustion models for fuel additives and biofuels. © 2021 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study investigates the morphology and nanostructure of soot particles during cold-start and hot-start engine operation of a diesel engine using oxygenated fuels. The soot samples were analysed using transmission electron microscopy. The oxygen content in the fuel was varied between 0 and 12%. The results showed that the primary particles during cold-start have significantly smaller size when compared to hot-start engine operation. The addition of oxygenated fuels also resulted in smaller sized primary particles. Smaller radius of gyration and higher fractal dimension of soot aggregates during cold-start would mean smaller aggregate size with a more compact structure. Shorter fringes with a higher inter-fringe spacing for cold-start would mean lower graphitisation of soot particles that could be related to higher oxidation reactivity of soot particles. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The performances of two novel aerogel based catalysts on the production of renewable diesel were compared with an impregnated catalyst for the deoxygenation of undiluted soybean oil. The catalysts were extensively characterized. The aerogel catalysts exhibited a remarkably higher production of hydrocarbons with a reaction rate over 4 times that of the impregnated catalyst and selectivity to uncracked hydrocarbon in excess of 90%. All catalysts exhibited zero order behavior in the undiluted condition tested and no deactivation was detected. The specific acidity appears to be directly linked to the degree of cracking achieved by the catalyst, with the impregnated catalyst being both the most acid and exhibiting the higher degree of cracking, thus lowering its selectivity. The subcritically dried aerogel catalyst had the best overall performance, exhibiting low levels of cracking and high selectivity to larger hydrocarbons, which has been linked to smaller crystallites and higher specific area. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is a type of widely recognized environmentally friendly and sustainable biofuel. The key point for the industrial manufacturing of biodiesel is its cost, especially the price of raw oil feedstocks. Oil feedstocks of low quality require highly effective catalysts with more active sites (e.g., acid, base, acid-base, and enzyme) for (trans)esterification. Metal-organic framework (MOF) is a kind of polyporous material that can control its pore size and topological structure to fit the requirements of the catalytic reactions or conversion routes. This review focuses on the application of MOF-based catalysts in the preparation of biodiesel. Two methods of linking the active sites with MOF are introduced including intermolecular forces and chemical bridging or bonding. Four kinds of MOF-based nanocatalysts (i.e., enzyme, base, acid, and bifunctional catalysts) are evaluated and compared with other heterogeneous catalysts. Besides, technologies such as ultrasound and microwave for MOF-based nanocatalyst applications to produce biodiesel through transesterification and esterification are described. Finally, a brief conclusion and perspective for MOF-based nanocatalyst that applies to biodiesel production are provided. The MOF-based functional catalytic materials show great potential in biodiesel production and other relevant biorefineries. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - This paper estimates the financial benefits accruing to fossil fuel producers (i.e., the producer incidence) that arise because of implicit fossil fuel subsidies in the United States. The analysis takes account of coal, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel, along with the implicit subsidies due to externalized environmental damages, public health effects, and transportation-related costs. The direct benefit to fossil fuel producers across all four fuels is estimated at $62 billion per year, a sum calculated due to the higher price that suppliers receive because of inefficient pricing compared to the counterfactual scenario where environmental and public health externalities are internalized. A significant portion of these benefits accrue to relatively few companies, and specific estimates are provided for companies with the largest production. The financial benefit because of unpriced costs borne by society is comparable to 18% of net income from continuing domestic operations for the median natural gas and oil producer in 2017-2018, and it exceeds net income for the majority of coal producers. The results clarify what the domestic fossil fuel industry has at stake financially when it comes to policies that seek to address climate change, adverse health effects from local pollution, and inefficient transportation. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - There is a growing need for drop-in biofuels for gas turbines for enhanced energy security and sustainability. Several fuels are currently being developed and tested to reduce dependency on fossil fuels while maintaining performance, particularly in the aviation industry. The transition from traditional fossil fuels to sustainable biofuels is much desired for reducing the rapidly rising CO2 levels in the environment. This requires biofuels to be drop-in ready, where there are no adverse effects on performance and emissions upon replacement. In this study, the performance and emissions of four different aviation drop-in biofuels were evaluated. They include UOP HEFA-SPK, Gevo ATJ, Amyris Farnesane, and SB-JP-8. These aviation biofuels are currently being produced and tested to be ready for full or partial drop-in fuels as the replacement of traditional jet fuels. The characteristic performance of each fuel from the prevaporized liquid fuels was performed in a high-intensity (20 MW/m3-atm) reverse flow combustor. The NO emissions showed near unity ppm levels for each of the fuels examined with a minimum at an equivalence ratio of ∼0.6, while CO levels were in the range of 1000-1300 ppm depending on the fuel at an equivalence ratio between 0.75 and 0.8. For an equivalence ratio range between 0.4 and 0.6, NO and CO emissions remained very low (between 1-2 ppm NO and 2400-2900 ppm CO) depending on the fuel. The examined biofuels did not show any instability over a wide range of equivalence ratios from lean to near stoichiometric condition. These results provide promising results on the behavior of these drop-in aviation biofuels for use in high-intensity gas turbine combustors providing stability and cleaner performance without any modification to the combustor design. © 2020 by ASME

AB  - The following article focuses on sustainable aviation fuels, which include first and second generation biofuels and other non-biomass fuels that meet most of environmental, operational and physicochemical requirements. Several of the requirements for sustainable aviation fuels are discussed in this article. The main focus was on researching the alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) alternative fuel. The tests covered the emission of harmful gaseous compounds with the Semtech DS analyzer, as well as the number and mass concentration of particles of three fuels: reference fuel Jet A-1, a mixture of Jet A-1 and 30% of ATJ fuel, and mixture of Jet A-1 and 50% of ATJ fuel. The number concentration of particles allowed us to calculate, inter alia, the corresponding particle number index and particle mass index. The analysis of the results made it possible to determine the effect of the content of alternative fuel in a mixture with conventional fuel on the emission of harmful exhaust compounds and the concentration of particles. One of the main conclusion is that by using a 50% blend of ATJ and Jet A-1, the total number and mass of particulate matter at high engine loads can be reduced by almost 18% and 53%, respectively, relative to pure Jet A-1 fuel. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Phytoremediation is an attractive strategy for cleaning soils polluted with a wide spectrum of organic and inorganic toxic compounds. Among these pollutants, heavy metals have attracted global attention due to their negative effects on human health and terrestrial ecosystems. As a result of this, numerous studies have been carried out to elucidate the mechanisms involved in removal processes. These studies have employed many plant species that might be used for phytoremediation and the obtention of end bioproducts such as biofuels and biogas useful in combustion and heating. Phytotechnologies represent an attractive segment that is increasingly gaining attention worldwide due to their versatility, economic profitability, and environmental cobenefits such as erosion control and soil quality and functionality improvement. In this review, the process of valorizing biomass from phytoremediation is described; in addition, relevant experiments where polluted biomass is used as feedstock or bioenergy is produced via thermo- and biochemical conversion are analyzed. Besides, pretreatments of biomass to increase yields and treatments to control the transfer of metals to the environment are also mentioned. Finally, aspects related to the feasibility, benefits, risks, and gaps of converting toxic-metal-polluted biomass are discussed. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Biomass can be envisaged as a potential solution to mitigate the problems that the extensive exploitation of fossil sources causes on the environment. Transforming biomass into addedvalue products with better calorific properties is highly desired. Thermochemical liquefaction can convert biomass into a bio-oil. The work herein presented concerns the study of direct liquefaction of Eucalyptus globulus sawdust. The main goal was to optimise the operating conditions of the process to achieve high bio-oil conversion rates. Studies were carried out to understand the impact of the process factors, such as the residence time, catalyst concentration, temperature, and the biomassto- solvent ratio. The E. globulus sawdust conversion into bio-oil was achieved with a maximum conversion of 96.2%. A higher conversion was reached when the eucalyptus sawdust’s thermochemical liquefaction was conducted over 180 minutes in the presence of a >2.44% catalyst concentration at 160 °C. A lower biomass-to-solvent ratio favours the process leading to a higher conversion of biomass into bio-oil. The afforded bio-oil presented a better higher heating value than that of E. globulus sawdust. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - To upgrade biomass-derived alcohol mixtures to biofuels under solvent-free conditions, MgO–Al2O3 mixed metal oxides (MMO) decorated with Ni nanoparticles (Ni–MgO–Al2O3) are synthesized and characterized. Based on the result, Ni nanoparticles are highly dispersed on the surface of MgAl MMO. As the Ni loading content varies from 2 to 10 wt.%, there is a slight increase in the mean Ni particle size from 6.7 to 8.5 nm. The effects of Ni loading amount, reducing temperature, and Mg/Al ratio on the conversion and product distribution are investigated. With the increase in both the Ni loading amount and reducing temperature, dehydrogenation (the first step of the entire reaction network) is accelerated. This results in an increase in the conversion process and a higher selectivity for the dialkylated compounds. Due to the higher strength and density of basic sites under high Mg/Al ratios, double alkylation is preferred and more long-chain hydrocarbons are obtained. A conversion of 89.2% coupled with a total yield of 79.9% for C5–C15 compounds is acquired by the as-prepared catalyst (prepared with Ni loading of 6 wt.%, reducing temperature of 700◦C, and Mg/Al molar ratio of 3. After four runs, the conversion drops by 17.1%, and this loss in the catalytic activity can be attributed to the decrease in the surface area of the catalyst and the increase in the Ni mean particle size. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - There is a great interest in the utilization of various renewable energy resources in the agricultural sector due to the production and consumption of limited fossil fuel resources and the ever-increasing energy demand in developing countries such as Iran. Investigation of agricultural production in various provinces of Iran revealed significant potential for bioenergy production in this sector including ethanol, butanol, methane, hydrogen, and biodiesel. Statistical data for each province including population, cultivated land area, energy and fertilizer consumption, and agricultural production rate were used to calculate CO2 emissions and bioenergy replacement potential. The energy demand, potential, and related CO2 emissions were computed and discussed. The energy demand in the agricultural sector was 36.2 TWh, 13.2 ktons, 2257.7 ktons, and 2408 Mm3 of electricity, kerosene, diesel, and natural gas, respectively. On the other hand, the potential of bioethanol, biodiesel and biogas was respectively 2.932×106m3, 0.44×106tons and 2.647×109m3. These biofuels are processed to replace fossil fuels. In the case of bioethanol and biogas, 10% of the calculated potential and total potential of biodiesel was assumed to be accessible. Accordingly, the potential to recover the bioethanol, biogas, and biodiesel demand is 100%, 11%, and 19.5%, respectively. In this scenario, the total CO2 emissions from the conventional energy system was 46.7 million tons per year, which can be decreased by 77.2% by changing the fuels. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - There are several alternatives for how to phase out diesel in heavy-duty transports, thereby reducing the sector's climate change impact. This paper assesses the well-to-wheel (WTW) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of energy carriers for heavy-duty vehicles, analyzing the effect of the carbon intensity of the electricity used in production. The results show that energy carriers with high electricity dependence are not necessarily better than diesel from a WTW perspective. In particular, fuels produced through electrolysis are not well suited in carbon-intense electricity systems. Conversely, waste-based biofuels have low GHG emissions regardless of the electricity system. Battery-electric buses show a large reduction of GHG emissions compared to diesel buses and many other alternatives, while battery-electric trucks have higher GHG emissions than diesel in carbon intense electricity systems. Thus, electrifying transports or switching to renewable fuels will not suffice if the electricity system is not made renewable first. © 2021

AB  - The energy demand worldwide is ever-increasing with a growth of 2.3% registered in 2018. This means that there has also been an increasing demand for fuels. Biomass is an interesting alternative to fossil fuels as it contributes to a decrease of their adverse environmental effects. Nonetheless, biomass combustion may present several problems related to, for example, the initial moisture content and the increase of the emission of fine particles. This work describes the study undertaken regarding acid-catalysed liquefaction of different lignocellulosic biomasses as an alternative to process biomasses with high moisture contents and to decrease the emission of fine particles through the partial removal of the mineral matter of biomass. This process allows the production of a liquid biofuel which is more easily burned than the original biomass; moreover, it is also expected to reduce fly-ash forming species. Thus, olive stone/pits, olive bagasse, grape seeds and rice husk liquefaction was carried out at 160 °C using 2-Ethylhexanol as the solvent and a high biomass to solvent ratio of 1:1. In these conditions, a maximum conversion of 55% of the biomass into bio-oil was obtained for olive stone. On the other hand, 60–70% of the inorganic content of the biomasses was removed in the liquefaction stage. This result is an indication that, together with the production of a liquid biofuel, liquefaction can also be used as a pre-treatment to decrease the emission of fine particles associated to biomass combustion. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In order to produce an alternative energy of biodiesel using field pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.) seed oil, a novel Fe3O4/graphene oxide-phenylalanine bisulfate ionic liquid core-shell magnetic catalyst was developed. Ferroferric oxide nanoparticles and graphene oxide (GO) were employed to prepare a magnetic carrier of Fe3O4@GO nanocomposite which applied to immobilize phenylalanine bisulfate ionic liquid (PBIL). The immobilized PBIL was characterized by the means of characterization. The heterogeneous Fe3O4@GO@PBIL catalyst was demonstrated to have a high catalytic efficiency that reached 92.38 % of biodiesel yield under the optimal conditions (methanol/oil molar ratio of 10:1, reaction temperature of 60 °C, reaction time of 4 h, catalyst dosage of 25 wt%, stirring speed of 1500 r/min). After transesterification processes, the catalyst could be easily removed from the reaction mixture with an external magnet and showed little deactivation after multiple recycles. The main properties of biodiesel product were reconcilable with the range of test standards of ASTM D6751 and EN 14214. In summary, the prepared Fe3O4@GO@PBIL catalyst behaved a superiorly catalytic performance, which made the produced biodiesel possess the possibility of application to biofuel as an ideal substitution. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study explores the techno-economic analysis of producing Camelina-derived Hydroprocessed Renewable Jet (HRJ) fuel in Montana using the hydro-deoxygenation (HDO) pathway. The HDO method requires added hydrogen and increases cost. The estimated breakeven price of Camelina-derived HRJ fuel generated from the HDO reaction follows the UOP Honeywell procedure. Oilseed cultivation, lipid extraction, and HRJ fuel production were evaluated to estimate the HRJ fuel breakeven price. In an extraction facility with annual processing capacity of 3000 Mg, the breakeven price of Camelina oil was $0.35 per liter over a 20-year operating period and $0.34 per liter over a 30-year period. For a 20-year operating period, the deterministic breakeven price of HRJ fuel was $0.87 per liter with a commercial hydrogen and $1.01 per liter when the plant generated its own hydrogen supply; a 30-year operating period had $0.02 per liter savings. The sensitivity analysis indicates a breakeven price between $0.87 and $1.44 per liter in a facility with an on-site hydrogen plant, and between $0.75 and $1.26 per liter when purchasing hydrogen. An additional $0.02 per liter of capital investment cost is incurred to produce HRJ fuel instead of renewable diesel. Depending on the fuel product, investors would have a capital cost penalty of $0.13 to $0.15 per liter for producing hydrogen on-site. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Addressing dual crisis of fossil fuels i.e. environmental as well as gradually decreasing reserves, design of a nationwide robust supply chain network based on bio-energy has been presented in this work. The four echelon supply chain caters the target of blending 20% bio fuels with conventional fuel during 2018–2026. The mixed integer linear programming model considers handling of multiple types of feed sources, products, transport options while performing the techno, economic and environmental analysis of the supply chain to optimally determine the operational and design decisions. The uncertainty in demand, import product price and biomass feed supply has been tackled using data driven robust optimization approach developed using fuzzy transcription of discontinuous uncertain parameter space using machine learning based unsupervised learning methods. To handle a ∼50% increase in overall biofuel demand over the nine-year planning horizon, the deterministic model shows a dynamically changing supply chain with a ∼20% increase in the newly added locations; however, the worst case robust optimization results are reported to be 6% leaner than the results obtained for the deterministic model. The sensitivity analysis of biomass availability on net present value indicates the need of 43% and above biomass feed supply to run such bio supply chain sector to survive. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work investigates the thermodynamics and kinetics of the synthesis of 5-HMF-cyclic acetal, a fuel additive, from 5-HMF and 1,3-propanediol using lab synthesized, environmentally benign Brønsted acidic ionic liquid (IL) catalyst. Firstly, a thermodynamic study of the acetalization of 5-HMF with different mono and polyalcohols was carried out to evaluate the thermodynamic properties of critical temperature (Tc), critical volume (Vc), critical pressure (Pc), Gibbs free energy of formation (ΔGf0), enthalpy of formation (ΔfH0), and heat capacity (Cp) using group contribution methods. Then, kinetics of 5-HMF acetalization with 1,3-propanediol was investigated in a batch autoclave using Brønsted acidic IL catalyst and effect of reaction parameters temperature, molar ratio of reactants and time were investigated on the conversion of 5-HMF into 5-HMF-cyclic acetal product and optimized for high 5-HMF conversion and cyclic acetal yield. A first-order pseudo-homogeneous kinetic model with a squared regression coefficient R2 &gt; 0.99 fitted well with experimental data. The activation energy of the acetalization reaction is estimated to be 83 kJ/mol for the 1st order kinetics. Based on the catalyst activity, a plausible reaction mechanism was proposed for the acetalization reaction of 5-HMF and 1,3-propanediol. Finally, this manuscript reports an efficient method for the production of fuel-additive compound and valuable information for predicting the thermodynamic properties for the pure organic components. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, conventional diesel fuel, pure Jatropha biodiesel, Jatropha-butanol blended fuel, and Jatropha biodiesel with fumigated butanol were tested in a single-cylinder direct-injection four-stroke diesel engine. The engine performance, combustion, and emissions were measured at 3600 rpm and brake power of 4.4 kW. For Jatropha, tests revealed that brake thermal efficiency was reduced by 5% and brake-specific fuel consumption was increased by 17% relative to diesel. An overall reduction in exhaust emissions (oxides of nitrogen, unburned hydrocarbons, and smoke opacity) was observed with the exceptions of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. For Jatropha-butanol blended fuel, the efficiency was increased by 2% relative to Jatropha; however, it was still 3% less than that of diesel. The fuel consumption was increased relative to both Jatropha and diesel. In terms of emissions, oxides of nitrogen and smoke opacity were reduced by 12.3% and 72%, respectively, with increased carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbon emissions compared to diesel fuel. For Jatropha with fumigated butanol, the efficiency was increased by 4% relative to Jatropha and decreased by mere 1% when compared to diesel. The fuel consumption showed a reduction of 1.4% when compared to Jatropha. A substantial decrease in opacity (85%), oxides of nitrogen (12.7%), and carbon dioxide (4%) emissions was recorded relative to diesel; however, carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons were increased. It was concluded that butanol fumigation successfully improved the properties of Jatropha biodiesel and provided an overall better performance relative to blended fuel and neat Jatropha biodiesel. © 2020, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - A new series of acidic, dendrimeric polyamidoamine based polymeric ionic liquids of [PAMAM3256Cn] were synthesized with a second generation polyamidoamine dendrimer, alkyl bromides and 1, 3-propane sultone via a two-step procedure. The structure of functional ionic liquids was characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The polyamidoamine -1- dodecyl [PAMAM3256C12] catalyst was used for green fuel production via the transesterification of yellow grease. The influence of reaction variables on the green fuel yield was studied using this catalyst. The catalyst was effective having achieved a 93% green fuel yield from yellow grease after 6 h of reaction at 65 °C, using 306.8 mol (10 mmol) (wt % based on molar concentration of lipids) of [PAMAM3256C12] catalyst, a yellow grease-to-methanol molar ratio of 1:20 with a constant agitation speed 800 rpm. The catalyst was showed excellent stability for yellow grease transesterification over four cycles. Additionally, catalysts showed excellent transesterification activity of Jatropha curcas, Ricinus communis, and Pistacia chinensis oil, with green fuel yields of 90, 91, and 92%, respectively. The properties of green fuel were met the ASTM D6751-02 standards. Results indicate that the [PAMAM3256C12] catalyst system shows promising potential as a viable industrial-scale alternative. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Experimental data of excess enthalpy, (HE), density, (p), speed of sound, (u), and the refractive index, (nD), are reported in this work for ternary and binary mixtures composed of diethylene glycol monoethyl ether (2-(2-ethoxyethoxy)ethanol), heptane, and isooctane at 0.1 MPa and 298.15 and 313.15 K, over the whole set of mole fractions (680 points). Based on it, derivative properties such as excess volume, (VE), isentropic compressibility, (Ks), deviation in isentropic compressibility, (Δks), and deviation in the refractive index, (ΔnD), were determined. The Redlich-Kister equation is used to correlate the excess enthalpies, excess volumes, deviations in isentropic compressibility, and deviations in the refractive index. Also, the predictive Peng-Robinson 1978 (PPR78) equation of state (EoS) is employed to model the experimental data of HE. To predict the HE data, the NRTL and UNIQUAC models are applied, relatively to the PPR78 EoS. In addition, the perturbed chain-statistical associating fluid (PC-SAFT) equation of state is employed to fit the density measured data for the ternary and binary mixtures. Intermolecular interactions have been discussed for the studied binary and ternary mixtures. No reference data were found in the literature for binary or ternary mixtures containing 2-(2-ethoxyethoxy)ethanol, with the purpose of making a comparison with our presented experimental data. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biogas consisting primarily of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) can be upgraded to a transportation fuel referred to as renewable natural gas (RNG) by removing CO2 and other impurities. RNG has energy content comparable to fossil compressed natural gas (CNG) but with lower life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this study, a light-duty cargo van was tested with CNG and two RNG blends on a chassis dynamometer in order to compare the toxicity of the resulting exhaust. Tests for reactive oxygen species (ROS), biomarker expressions (CYP1A1, IL8, COX-2), and mutagenicity (Ames) show that RNG exhaust has toxicity that is comparable or lower than CNG exhaust. Statistical analysis reveals associations between toxicity and tailpipe emissions of benzene, dibenzofuran, and dihydroperoxide dimethyl hexane (the last identification is considered tentative/uncertain). Further gas-phase toxicity may be associated with tailpipe emissions of formaldehyde, dimethyl sulfide, propene, and methyl ketene. CNG exhaust contained higher concentrations of these potentially toxic chemical constituents than RNG exhaust in all of the current tests. Photochemical aging of the vehicle exhaust did not alter these trends. These preliminary results suggest that RNG adoption may be a useful strategy to reduce the carbon intensity of transportation fuels without increasing the toxicity of the vehicle exhaust. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A driving cycle is a record intended to reflect the regular use of a given type of vehicle, presented as a speed profile recorded over a certain period of time. It is used for the assessment of engine pollutant emissions, fuel consumption analysis and environmental certification procedures. Different driving cycles are used, depending on the region of the world. In addition, drive cycles are used by car manufacturers to optimize vehicle drivelines. The basis of the work presented in the manuscript was a developed computer tool using tests on the Toyota Camry LE 2018 chassis dy-namometer, the results of the optimization process of neural network structures and the properties of fuels and biofuels. As a result of the work of the computer tool, the consumption of petrol 95, ethanol, methanol, DME, CNG, LPG and CO2 emissions for the vehicle in question were analyzed in the fol-lowing driving tests: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA US06 and EPA USSC03); Supplemental Federal Test Procedure (SFTP); Highway Fuel Economy Driving Schedule (HWFET); Federal Test Procedure (FTP-75–EPA); New European Driving Cycle (NEDC); Random Cycle Low (×05); Random Cycle High (×95); Mobile Air Conditioning Test Procedure (MAC TP); Common Artemis Driving Cycles (CADC–Artemis); Worldwide Harmonized Light-Duty Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP). © 2021 by the author.

AB  - The worldwide consumption of fossil hydrocarbons in the road transport sector in 2020 corresponded to roughly half of the overall consumption. However, biofuels have been discreetly contributing to mitigate gaseous emissions and participating in sustainable development, and thus leading to the extending of the commercial utilization of internal combustion engines. In this scenario, the present work aims at exploring the effects of alternative fuels containing a blend of 15% ethanol and 35% biodiesel with a 50% fossil diesel (E15D50B35) or 50% Fischer–Tropsch (F-T) diesel (E15FTD50B35) on the engine combustion, exhaust emissions (CO, HC, and NOx), particulate emissions characteristics as well as the performance of an aftertreatment system of a common rail diesel engine. It was found that one of the blends (E15FTD50B35) showed more than 30% reduction in PM concentration number, more than 25% reduction in mean particle size, and more than 85% reduction in total PM mass with respect to conventional diesel fuel. Additionally, it was found that the E15FTD50B35 blend reduces gaseous emissions of total hydrocarbons (THC) by more than 25% and NO by 3.8%. The oxidation catalyst was effective in carbonaceous emissions reduction, despite the catalyst light-off being slightly delayed in comparison to diesel fuel blends. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Solid acid catalyzed cracking of waste oil‐derived fatty acids is an attractive route to hydrocarbon fuels. HZSM‐5 is an effective acid catalyst for fatty acid cracking; however, its microporous nature is susceptible to rapid deactivation by coking. We report the synthesis and application of hierarchical HZSM‐5 (h‐HZSM‐5) in which silanization of pre‐crystallized zeolite seeds is employed to introduce mesoporosity during the aggregation of growing crystallites. The resulting h‐HZSM‐5 comprises a disordered array of fused 10–20 nm crystallites and mesopores with a mean diameter of 13 nm, which maintain the high surface area and acidity of a conventional HZSM‐5. Mesopores increase the yield of diesel range hydrocarbons obtained from oleic acid deoxygenation from ~20% to 65%, attributed to improved acid site accessibility within the hierarchical network. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - In this paper, we describe a process to add value to the biomass derivatives (i.e., levulinic acid), converting it to bioadditives over solid Sn(II) exchanged Keggin heteropolyacid salts. These solid catalysts are an attractive alternative to the traditional soluble and corrosive Brønsted acid catalysts. Among Sn(II) heteropoly salts, the Sn1.5PW12O40 was the most active and selective catalyst, achieving high conversions (ca. 90 %) and selectivity (90–97 %) for alkyl esters and angelica lactone, the main reaction products. The impacts of the main reaction parameters (i.e., catalyst load, temperature, and the molar ratio of alcohol to acid) were investigated. The use of renewable raw material, and an efficient and recyclable catalyst are the main positive features of this process. The Sn1.5PW12O40 catalyst was easily recovered and reused without loss activity. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The use of insects as feedstock for biodiesel production has sparsely been studied and very little is known of the fuel properties and engine performance of insect biodiesel. In this study, biodiesel was initially produced from an insect feedstock M. nigeriensis, then its physicochemical properties were characterized. The biodiesel was produced via the three-step process of lipid extraction, acid esterification (1 wt% H2SO4) and alkaline transesterification (0.5 wt% NaOH). The optimal reaction time, temperature and methanol-oil molar ratio for the acid-esterification process resulted in a free fatty acid conversion of 96.58%. The volumetric yield, fatty acid methyl esters content and physicochemical properties of M. nigeriensis biodiesel were analyzed using various analytical equipment such as the GC-HRMS, and 1H NMR. Analysis of the production process showed that 86.54 vol% biodiesel was obtained from M. nigeriensis oil. Further analysis showed that the biodiesel contained 96.72% fatty acid methyl esters. The composition of the fatty acid methyl esters was found to be 48% saturated esters and 52% monosaturated esters. The biodiesel density (841 kg m−3), viscosity (2.32 mm2 s−1), flash point (125 °C), pour point (−15 °C), cetane number (51.4), higher heating value (41.8 MJ kg−1) and acid value (0.44 mgKOH.g−1) were in compliance with the ASTM D6751 standards. One of the important results to highlight is the remarkably low viscosity of the biodiesel, which is attributed to the high concentration of monounsaturated fatty acid methyl esters. Lower viscosity of fuel helps to improve fuel atomization and combustion efficiency, and hence lower emissions. The absence of polyunsaturated fatty acid esters also indicates that the biodiesel will have good oxidation stability. © 2021

AB  - During the decades past, the engine industries have witnessed a remarkable upsurge in the research and development (R&D) of modern technologies due to factors such as energy security and environmental concerns. Focus is on improved engine performance, sustainable energy, fuel economy, and minimal harmful exhaust emissions. Even though globally large database now captures modern engine technologies, a skillful presentation of those data is a demanding task. Based on this analogy, the authors made a conscious effort to brief audience on the various fuels used in Wankel rotary engine (RE) which is a type of internal combustion engine (ICE). Wankel REs various operating models, their merits, and demerits regarding modern engine technologies, the type of fuels and their utilization methods, and the future prospect of biofuel as its engine fuel has been made accessible in a subtle manner in this paper. In summary, this paper provides a wide scope review of basic principles that govern practical Wankel RE design and operation, the widely used single fuels and multi fuels in Wankel RE operation with their properties as well as emissions, and the practical Wankel RE design and operation in the present era and the prospects in the near future. It also outlines simplified frameworks of modern Wankel RE technologies structured in a systematic way to contribute to enhanced engine performance, sustainable energy, reduce fuel consumption, and reduce exhaust emissions in this pragmatic field. © 2021 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

AB  - The hydrotreating of bio-oil under mild conditions using inexpensive bimetallic catalysts advances the production of petroleum-like hydrocarbons from biomass wastes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd
Although liquid products derived from the pyrolysis of biomass are promising for the production of petroleum-like hydrocarbon fuels, the catalytic burden of hydrodeoxygenation must be reduced to achieve feasible upgrading processes. Herein, mild hydrotreating of an acid-rich biomass pyrolysis oil (bio-oil) with an unusually high total acid number (588 mg KOH/g bio-oil) was performed to stabilize the low-quality bio-oil. Ru-added TiO2-supported transition metal catalysts stabilized the bio-oil by reducing its acidity more compared to what could be achieved by Ru-free catalysts; this process also leads to lower loss of organic compounds compared to when using a Ru/TiO2 catalyst. Based on the performance of transition metal catalysts, including Ni, Co, and Cu, supported on TiO2, tungstate-zirconia, or SiO2, supported bimetallic catalysts were prepared by adding Ru to the TiO2-supported metal catalysts. The bimetallic catalysts Ru/Ni/TiO2 and Ru/Co/TiO2 exhibited good decarboxylation activity for the removal of carboxylic acids and a higher yield of organic compounds compared to that provided by Ru, which can be deemed appropriate for feedstocks when hydrodeoxygenation needs to suppress the loss of organic reactants. Using these catalysts, the carboxylic acid concentration was reduced to 319–323 mg KOH/g bio-oil with organic yields of 62–63 wt% at reaction temperatures 150–170 °C lower than the temperature required for direct conversion of carboxylic acids to alcohols or deoxygenates. The improved catalytic hydrotreating activity of Ru-added transition metals can be attributed to the high acid site densities of these catalysts along with their improved hydrogenation activities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel has been viewed as an alternative vehicle fuel for sustainable transportation, and sustainability assessments of various crop-based biodiesel fuels are meaningful for decision makers to select the best option. However, the development of crop-based biodiesel fuels has encountered a number of barriers and challenges. This study identifies and analyses the factors that block the adoption and promotion of biodiesel as alternative vehicle fuels by using fishbone diagram and best-worst methods. It also measures the sustainability of different crop-based biodiesel options by adopting the ecological footprint as a generic index for sustainability assessment from a life cycle perspective. As a result, it summarises a set of factors that hinder crop-based biodiesel development and finds that shortages of feedstock supplies, conflicts with human food supplies, and feedstocks are the greatest barriers to China's biodiesel development. Sustainability measurements of the ecological footprints of five crop-based biodiesel options indicate that palm-based biodiesel is the most sustainable among all options. Finally, the study provides some policy conclusions from the aspects of strategy and policy measures, promotion of non-edible feedstock, investment in foreign palm plantations and introduction of suitable palm species, technological innovation and improvement, knowledge pervasion and social promotion to promote biodiesel development. © 2020

AB  - Household biofuel burning contributes a large proportion of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), black carbon (BC), and organic carbon (OC) emissions in many parts of the world. Dilution sampling has been widely used to characterize PM2.5 emitted from biofuel burning. The residence time in the dilution chamber is a key parameter for accurate sampling. However, residence time has not yet been adequately characterized for biomass combustion. In this work, we investigated the effects of residence time of dilution sampling on PM2.5 emissions from a typical Chinese household stove burning typical biofuels including three major crop wastes and one type of wood. The filter based measurements indicated that the emission factors for PM2.5 and its main chemical components such as OC, EC, Cl−, and K+ did not vary with the residence time over the range of 1–80 s. Theoretical estimation of average time scale for achieving dynamic equilibrium (τs) between the gas and particle phase in the dilution sampling system was less than 1 s. Both the measurement study and theoretical simulations indicated that dilution sampling with a residence time of 1s can provide adequately reliable results for PM2.5 emissions from biofuel burning under the condition of these experiments. A simple way to estimate the equilibration time based on measured average PM2.5 concentration was proposed. Recommendations are provided for the residence time for dilution sampling of accurate measurements of PM2.5 emissions from biofuel burning. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study reports the use of ultraviolet–visible absorption, steady-state fluorescence, and time-resolved fluorescence to determine the water content in ethanol by using Rhodamine B as an optical probe. The experiments were performed by preparing water/ethanol blends with different percentages of water in the presence of the optical probe. The absorbance, fluorescence intensity, and fluorescence lifetime values were linearly dependent on the water content in the blends in the range between 0 and 10% (w/w). The results also revealed that the three techniques have a limit of detection for water ≤ 1.4% (w/w). Besides, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to evaluate the interaction of RhB with water and ethanol molecules when subjected to different water content in the blends. The simulations revealed that water molecules perform well-oriented dipole-dipole interactions (hydrogen bonding) with chromophores/fluorophores groups of Rhodamine B, affecting its absorption and emission characteristics, and altering the microenvironment density and viscosity. The present findings point out that common optical techniques can be used to develop a simple, rapid, portable, and precise approach to monitor water in ethanol as far as RhB be used as a probe. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) was converted into several biofuel additives such as alkoxymethylfurans (AMFs) and 2,5-bis(alkoxymethyl)furans (BAMFs) through two-step sequential hydrogenation and etherification reactions. In the first step, zinc‑iron magnetic nanocatalyst supported on activated carbon (ZnO-Fe3O4/AC) was prepared for the selective hydrogenation of HMF into BHMF and 5-MFA via Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reaction in three different hydrogen donor alcohols (ethanol, 1-propanol, and 1-butanol). The important physical properties of the catalyst such as crystallinity, chemical composition, morphology, reduction behavior, and surface area were studied by using several analytical techniques. The effect of hydrogenation parameters such as catalyst concentration, temperature, and time on the selectivity of (BHMF and 5-MFA), and HMF conversion were studied. The best hydrogenation results were obtained with 0.2 mmole HMF and 100 mg of catalyst at 200 °C for 12 h. In the second step, three commercial Brønsted acid catalysts were used to convert the hydrogenated products into alkoxymethylfurans (AMFs) and 2,5-bis(alkoxymethyl)furans (BAMFs). At the optimum etherification conditions (65 °C and 10 h), a spectrum of mono-, di-, and tri- ether compounds were obtained. The hydrogenation catalyst (ZnO-Fe3O4/AC) was recycled and used for five times without a remarkable reduction in its catalytic activity. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Herein we demonstrated an economically beneficial process coproducing biojet fuel and high-value polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) from Schizochytrium sp. ABC101 microalgae. Schizochytrium is a promising biofuel source for its rapid growth, high cell density, and fast lipid accumulation via heterotrophic cultivation. The most important feature of Schizochytrium is that half of its lipids are composed of omega-3 PUFAs (i.e., docosahexaenoic acid and docosapentaenoic acid), which are currently commercialized as dietary supplements at a high price. We observed direct injection of PUFA-rich lipid into a high-temperature catalytic reactor can cause rapid catalyst deactivation via coke deposition. Therefore, the PUFAs were separated by short-path distillation after transesterification. The remaining esters of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) were catalytically deoxygenated into C13–C18 n-paraffins, and then subsequently hydrocracked to produce iso-rich paraffins that are suitable as biojet fuel. As the result, 54.6 wt% PUFA-enriched esters (purity: 87.7%) and 20.4 wt% of qualified biojet fuel with respect to the initial lipids were obtained. © 2020

AB  - The Brazilian as well as the global energy matrix is still mostly supported by non-renewable energy sources such as oil. However, the national energy scenario has a much higher renewable share, and this behavior is largely due to the fact that the country has abundant renewable resources. The immediate availability of renewable grease in Brazil fell on soybeans, the main Brazilian agricultural crop. However, reliance on a single source, whose oil yield per planted area is low (approximately 500 kg/ha), led to the need for alternative sources with higher energy density. Thus, this work sought to obtain biodiesel through frying oil mixed with castor oil in order to obtain biofuel with adequate physicochemical properties and reducing dependence on soybean oil. The physicochemical analyzes, as well as statistical tests revealed that among the obtained indexes, the acidity and the viscosity were above the value established by the National Petroleum Agency (ANP), while for the iodine index a positive effect of the addition of castor oil was registered, indicating effectiveness regarding the strategy used. The value of the acidity index with the addition of castor oil to the frying oil was 0.49 mg KOHg−1 and the viscosity value was equal to 7,02 mm2/s which was within the norms established by ANP, EU and ASTM. The value of the iodine index was 108.3 g/100 g of iodine, remaining within the EU standard, while without the addition of castor oil these two indices were not within the mentioned standards. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this paper, an anionic functionalized ionic liquid antioxidant [MI][C6H2(OH)3COO] was designed and synthesized by a two-step method. The structure was characterized by 1H NMR and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The mechanism and antioxidant properties of the ionic liquid antioxidants were studied, and the effect on the catalytic oxidation characteristics of iron and copper ions in biodiesel. The results show that [MI][C6H2(OH)3COO] can significantly improve the oxidation stability of biodiesel and has a significant inhibitory effect on the catalytic oxidation characteristics of iron ions in biodiesel. DFT calculations show that the BDE of O–H in three phenolic hydroxyl groups in [MI][C6H2(OH)3COO] is 300–325 kJ/mol, and that of O–H in [MI][C6H2(OH)3COO]-Fe3+ chelate is 306 kJ/mol. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, we present a techno-economic analysis for integrating an electrochemical reactor into a lignocellulosic biorefinery for the purpose of converting biorefinery lignin to higher-value industrial chemicals with co-generation of hydrogen. We consider how the electrochemical reactor impacts the manufacturing costs for producing biofuel and determine a break-even value for the lignin oxidation product stream, which is the minimum lignin conversion product stream value that renders the cost to produce biofuel the same as in the typical biorefinery concept. We conclude that at low extents of lignin conversion, the break-even product stream value is likely too high for the process to be feasible. However, at higher extents of lignin conversion, the break-even product stream value may be between $1.00 and $2.00/kg, depending on capital cost and other manufacturing costs like depreciation. Potential markets for the biomass conversion products include resin manufacturing, where the products would compete with petroleum-derived resin precursors. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This work assessed the impact of fuelling an automotive engine with palm biodiesel (pure, and two blends of 10% and 20% with diesel, B100, B10 and B20, respectively) operating under representative urban driving conditions on 17 priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compounds, oxidative potential of ascorbic acid (OPAA), and ecotoxicity through Daphnia pulex mortality test. PM diluted with filtered fresh air (WD) gathered in a minitunel, and particulate matter (PM) collected directly from the exhaust gas stream (W/oD) were used for comparison. Results showed that PM collecting method significantly impact PAH concentration. Although all PAH appeared in both, WD and W/oD, higher concentrations were obtained in the last case. Increasing biodiesel concentration in the fuel blend decreased all PAH compounds, and those with 3 and 5 aromatic rings were the most abundant. Palm biodiesel affected both OPAA and ecotoxicity. While B10 and B20 exhibited the same rate of ascorbic acid (AA) depletion, B100 showed significant faster oxidation rate during the first four minutes and oxidized 10% more AA at the end of the test. B100 and B20 were significantly more ecotoxic than B10. The lethal concentration LC50 for B10 was 6.13 mg/L. It was concluded that palm biodiesel decreased PAH compounds, but increased the oxidative potential and ecotoxicity. © 2020

AB  - Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) carried out at high temperatures and high hydrogen pressures is one of the alternative methods of upgrading pyrolytic oils from biomass, leading to high quality biofuels. To save energy, it is important to carry out catalytic processes under the mildest possible experimental conditions. The aim of our research was the synthesis of ordered mesoporous SBA-16 type silica materials modified with transition metal atoms (Ir, Ru, Pd, Pt), their physicochemical characterization and use as catalysts in hydrodeoxygenation of model chemicals (guaiacol, syringol, creosol). The HDO process was carried out under mild experimental conditions at temperatures in the range from 90 to 130 °C and hydrogen pressures in the range from 25 to 60 bar. The catalytic tests revealed differences in the catalytic properties of the samples studied. The catalytic systems used assured highly efficient transformations of the examined molecules as well as high selectivity towards chemical compounds with lower O/C ratio and higher H/C ratio as compared to those in the initial substrates. High activity of the catalysts containing precious metals in the experimental conditions applied suggests their potential to improve bio-oil production for biofuels. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

AB  - The use of antioxidants in biodiesels, especially the synthetic TBHQ, has been an efficient way of maintaining the oxidative stability of biofuel during storage for a longer period. Considering other types of products, the use of several natural antioxidants, such as Eugenol, has been promising to increase oxidation stability and conservation of foods, with few studies on biodiesel conservation. This study aimed to evaluate the antioxidant action of Eugenol and TBHQ in commercial biodiesel produced from soybean oil and animal fat blend in order to evaluate the efficiency of these antioxidants. Thus, the samples of pure commercial biodiesel (without antioxidant), enriched with the antioxidant TBHQ and Eugenol were prepared and stored in an oven at constant temperature of 43 °C for 150 days. Periodically, the samples were characterized by ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy and oxidation stability (Rancimat method). They were also chemically characterized concerning the acidity, peroxide and iodine amounts. The results showed higher efficiency of the antioxidant Eugenol in relation to the TBHQ, considering that the oxidation stability was within the standard legislations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study investigated the quantitative and qualitative attributes of liquid product and biochar obtained from pyrolysis of woody biomass (rubberwood sawdust (RWS)) and non-woody biomasses (oil palm trunk (OPT) and oil palm fronds (OPF)). The prepared biomass was pyrolyzed at temperatures of 500◦ C, 550◦ C, and 600◦ C by using an agitated bed pyrolysis reactor, and then the yields and characteristics of liquid product and biochar were determined. The results showed that liquid product and biochar yields were in the respective ranges of 35.94–54.40% and 23.46–25.98% (wt.). Pyrolysis of RWS at 550◦ C provided the highest liquid yield. The energy content of the water free liquid product was in the range 12.19–22.32 MJ/kg. The liquid product had a low pH and it mainly contained phenol groups as indicated by GC-MS. The biochars had high carbon contents (75.07–82.02%), while their oxygen contents were low (14.22–22%). The higher heating value (HHV) of biochar was in the range 26.42–29.33 MJ/kg. XRF analysis revealed that inorganic elements had higher contents in biochar than in the original biomass. The slagging and fouling indexes of biochar were also different from those of the biomass. High carbon content of the biochar confirms potential for its use in carbon sequestration. The specific surface of biochar was lower than that of biomass, while the average pore diameter of biochar was larger than for raw biomass as revealed by BET and SEM. These results on liquid product and biochar obtained from RWS, OPT, and OPF demonstrate that they are promising feedstocks for biofuels and other value-added products. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - An improved kinetic model for the deoxygenation of fatty acids was developed and compared with previously developed models. The models were compared using data collected from the deoxygenation of oleic acid using a novel, extensively characterized aerogel-based catalyst and previously published data of the deoxygenation of stearic acid, resulting in an extensive analysis ranging from 275 °C to 400 °C. The novel model was able to predict the behavior of reactants, intermediates and products for all cases analyzed in this paper. Akaike and Bayesian information criterions were applied, concluding that the novel kinetic model was indeed the best model to predict the behavior of both our original data and a previously published dataset. Relevant data regarding reaction rates and selectivity for the novel catalyst was given, showing a clear practical use of the results presented in this paper for the design and optimization of deoxygenation reactors. © 2020

AB  - In August 2019, a new bus fleet of 36 electric and 58 hybrid buses were implemented in Trondheim, Norway. This paper examines the carbon footprint of electrified city buses, by addressing the achieved and potential reduction for the new bus fleet. Important aspects such as geographical location of production, charging electricity mix, and impact from production and operation on lifetime emissions, are also examined. A meta-analysis on life cycle assessment studies was undertaken to investigate greenhouse gas emissions and energy demand in different parts of bus production. This is followed by the production of a bus model using the findings and comparing electrified buses with diesel and HVO buses. The models were then used in a case study of the bus fleet in Trondheim, to understand the specific parameters affecting the carbon footprint. The results show that the overall carbon footprint has been considerably reduced (37%) by implementing biofuel and electrified buses, and that a further reduction of 52% can be achieved through full electrification. The operation emissions for the fleet were found to be 49 g CO2-eq/person-km, which is lower than the average city bus and passenger car in Norway. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Humanity is facing some major global threats, namely lack of environmental sustainability, the energy crisis associated with the unsustainable reliance on fossil fuels, and water scarcity, which will be exacerbated with the rapid growth of urban areas. Researchers have drawn their attention to microalgae, photosynthetic microorganisms known for their environmental applications, such as wastewater remediation and lipids accumulation, to produce third-generation biofuels to solve some of these major issues. Considering this dual role, this study evaluated the potential of the microalga Chlorella vulgaris on nutrient removal from a paper industry effluent and bioenergy production. Firstly, experiments were performed to assess the potential of this microalga to: (i) successfully grow in different concentrations of a paper industry effluent (20% to 100%); and (ii) treat the industrial effluent, reducing phosphorus concentrations to values below the accepted legal limits. Then, a techno-economic assessment was performed to study the viability of a C. vulgaris biorefinery targeting the remediation of a paper industry effluent and bioenergy production. The results have shown that C. vulgaris was able to successfully grow and treat the paper industry effluent. Under these conditions, average biomass productivities determined for this microalga ranged between 15.5 ± 0.5 and 26 ± 1 mg dry weight (DW) L−1 d−1, with maximum biomass concentrations reaching values between 337 ± 9 and 495 ± 25 mg DW L−1 d−1. Moreover, final phosphorus concentrations ranged between 0.12 ± 0.01 and 0.5 ± 0.3 mg P L−1, values below the legal limits imposed by the Portuguese Environment Agency on the paper industry. Regarding the proposal of a microalgal biorefinery for the bioremediation of paper industry effluents with bioenergy production, the techno-economic study demonstrated that six of the seven studied scenarios resulted in an economically-viable infrastructure. The highest net present value (15.4 million euros) and lowest discounted payback period (13 years) were determined for Scenario 3, which assumed a photosynthetic efficiency of 3%, a lipids extraction efficiency of 75%, and an anaerobic digestion efficiency of 45%. Therefore, it was possible to conclude that besides being economically viable, the proposed biorefinery presents several environmental benefits: (i) the remediation of an industrial effluent; (ii) CO2 uptake for microalgal growth, which contributes to a reduction in greenhouse gases emissions; (iii) production of clean and renewable energy; (iv) soil regeneration; and (v) promotion of a circular economy. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - In Mexico, high quantities of lignocellulosic residues are generated. Such residues can be used to produce either biofuels of other products. In this work, a mathematical model representing the supply chain for the conversion of the lignocellulosic biomass in Mexico into biofuels and high-added value products is presented. The model aims to maximize the profit while satisfying as much as possible of the gasoline demand in the country. Additionally, the effect of the variations on the availability of raw materials and the demand of products over the optimal supply chain is analyzed. According to the results, the highest profit can be obtained if the biomass is used to produce levulinic acid and furfural, satisfying all the demand. If it is desired to satisfy the demand of ethanol or butanol, the profit is reduced. Under the studied conditions, only a fraction of the alcohol demand can be covered. © 2020

AB  - Post-grafting methodologies were used to prepare aryl-organosulfonic acid functionalized silica nanoparticles (SO3H-aryl-SiO2NPs) as highly active heterogeneous acid catalysts for catalytic esterification of free fatty acids (FFA) and levulinic acid (LA), and aldol condensation of furfural with 3-methylfuran, well known renewable feedstocks for biodiesel and fuel additives production. The chemical and structural characterization of the SO3H-aryl-SiO2NPs confirmed the success of the functionalization. Complete conversion for all FFA was observed using SO3H-aryl-SiO2NPs after 2 h of reaction. SiO2NPs_CSPTMS showed to be the most active and stable catalyst with no significant loss of activity in the first 5 cycles. In the LA esterification in the presence of an alcohol, complete conversion and selectivity and high reusability were observed (e.g., 83.2% yield after 10 cycles in the presence of 1-propanol, SiO2NPs10_CSPTMS, at 120 °C and 2h reaction). Finally, aldol condensation of furfural and 3-methylfuran had been performed using SiO2NPs_CSPTMS catalysts with almost 100% yield after 10 min at 65 °C, high stability and reusability for 7 catalytic cycles. In general, the prepared SO3H-aryl-SiO2NPs have demonstrated promising catalytic performance for transformation of biomass-derived feedstocks into biodiesel and fuel additives. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The increase in energy demand led to the challenging of alternative fuel development. Biofuels from palm oil through catalytic cracking appear as a promising alternative fuel. In this study, biofuel was produced from palm oil through catalytic cracking using the modified HY zeolite catalysts. The Ni and Co metals were impregnated on the HY catalyst through the wet-impregnation method. The catalysts were characterized using X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), Pyridine-probed Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) methods. The biofuels product obtained was analyzed using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method to determine its composition. The metal impregnation on the HY catalyst could modify the acid site composition (Lewis and Brønsted acid sites), which had significant roles in the palm oil cracking to biofuels. Ni impregnation on HY zeolite led to the high cracking activity, while the Co impregnation led to the high deoxygenation activity. Interestingly, the co-impregnation of Ni and Co on HY catalyst could increase the catalyst activity in cracking and deoxygenation reactions. The yield of biofuels could be increased from 37.32% to 40.00% by using the modified HY catalyst. Furthermore, the selectivity of gasoline could be achieved up to 11.79%. The Ni and Co metals impregnation on HY zeolite has a promising result on both the cracking and deoxygenation process of palm oil to biofuels due to the role of each metal. This finding is valuable for further catalyst development, especially on bifunctional catalyst development for palm oil conversion to biofuels. © 2020. The Authors.

AB  - This work investigates the oxidative stability and corrosivity of residual cooking oil (RCO) methyl biodiesel exposed to metallic coupons (copper and carbon steel) under simulated storage conditions (static immersion for 90 days within closed vessels) and the effect of antioxidants (tert-butylhydroquinone, curcumin, propylgallate, and butyl-hydroxyanisole) on biodiesel and metallic surfaces. The induction period measured during the experiment showed that all antioxidants retarded biodiesel degradation due to their antioxidant properties. Scanning-electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction of the metallic surfaces revealed the presence of oxides due to the corrosion by biodiesel in absence of antioxidants. Nevertheless, the presence of carbonaceous solids over the metallic surfaces was found which evidences the anticorrosive properties of the antioxidants, confirmed by X-Ray spectroscopy that showed increase in the content of carbon and oxygen on the surfaces. Measurements of corrosion rate also confirmed the anticorrosive action of all antioxidants. Hence, this work shows the dual properties of antioxidants acting as free radical scavengers in the RCO biodiesel as well as corrosive inhibitors, with a special performance of propylgallate, probably due to the presence of more hydroxyl groups in its structure that also may facilitate its interaction with the metallic surface. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The bioenergy sector in the European Union has undergone strong growth in line with the legislative framework, with environmental, economic and social implications at global scale. In Spain, almost 100% of biodiesel is produced from food and feed crops feedstocks. First-generation biodiesel will go on being a key partial rapid solution to replace fossil fuel in transport sector. However, impacts differ significantly among the type of agricultural system, the raw materials used and their life cycle. The aim of this study is to identify the best first-generation biodiesel alternative to replace petrodiesel in transport sector in the short term in Spain. Life Cycle Assessment normalization and weighting can facilitate decision making in situations where trade-offs among impact category results do not allow choosing one preferable solution among the alternatives. A panel weighting impact approach based on expert opinions was used to assess the sustainability of three biodiesel production systems. The results indicate that, according to expert's opinion, the rapeseed-based biodiesel produced entirely in Spain is the most sustainable alternative of biodiesel, with higher normalized weight (0.398), over soybean-based biodiesel produced in Argentina (0.291) or in Spain (0.312) using soybean oil imported from Argentina, because it could significatively increase job creation and gross value added. © 2020

AB  - Pyrolysis coupled to either thermal or catalytic cracking of mattress foam waste was performed in a laboratory-scale facility consisting of a fixed-bed reactor joined to a tubular cracking reactor. The results showed a great potential for the production of syngas specially at high cracking temperatures. Particularly, fixing 800 °C in the cracking reactor, a CO and CH4 rich gas with a remarkable amount of H2 was obtained. The addition of catalysts (dolomite, olivine or HiFUEL®) significantly decreased undesirable tar formation, (below 10 wt%), simultaneously increasing the gas yield and keeping CO and CH4 as the main components in the stream, becoming a preferable route that the non-catalytic process. Accordingly, this stream could be used preferably for further applications in energy generation because its heating value ranged between 15.7 MJ/Nm3 and 19.6 MJ/Nm3. In particular, the gas obtained by the use of dolomite could be advantageous for the production of organic compounds such as dimethyl ether (DME) as well as its use an engine or boiler to generate electricity in small facilities. In addition, the solid fraction obtained after de process could be used as a medium quality refused derived fuel (LHV ~ 12 MJ/kg) in order to support the internal energy requirements of the process. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Premixed flames play a prominent role in combustion systems such as aircraft combustors, gas turbines and internal combustion engines. Current fuels are also derived from fossil sources, including coal, petrol, gasoline, natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas. Alternatively, liquid and gaseous biofuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, hydrogen, wood gas or coal gas, can be used with appropriate modifications. Furthermore, the components of oxygenated fuel are known for their reduction of soot particles in diesel combustion processes while having little effect on nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions. The advantage of C1-oxygenate dimethoxymethane (OME1, also called “methylal” or DMM) is the lack of C-C bonds in their molecular structure. OME1 belongs to the group of oxymethylene ethers (OMEn) with the molecular structure CH3-O-(CH2-O)n-CH3 where n = 1 (short molecular structure: C3H8O2). This experimental and numerical study aims to investigate the laminar burning velocity (LBV) of the oxymethylene ether (OMEn, n = 1), the influence of temperature and nitrogen dilution. To our knowledge, no studies have been conducted with regards to nitrogen dilution during the measurements of OME1 burning velocity. In this study, a heat-flux burner setup was used to investigate the LBV for equivalence ratios from 0.7 to 1.6. The experimental LBV data shows a decreasing nonlinear influence of nitrogen dilution effects for 0% to 70% and increasing linear with preheating up to 373 K. The numerical results were compared with the experiments conducted with simple alcohols (ethanol) and C3 hydrocarbon fuels (propane). Existing numerical reaction mechanisms can only partially reproduce the new experimental data. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted by changing various parameters during the numerical investigations, in order to clarify the discrepancy. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - The hydroprocessing of palm oil was carried out in a continuous fixed bed reactor to produce biojet fuel using Rh/HZSM-5 catalyst. The effect of operating parameters, including reaction temperature, molar ratio, and solvent on the yield of biojet and biodiesel was evaluated. The catalyst deactivated rapidly in the solvent-free system due to carbon deposition. The application of 30% heptane in the feed maintained the conversion of palm oil above 90% for 8 hr. At 330°C, the liquid fuel product yield was slightly less than that obtained at 300°C since more gaseous product was formed. The H2-to-oil molar ratio of 158°C at 300°C was insufficient to maintain the reaction at high conversion. At 300°C and a H2-to-oil molar ratio of 316, the system was stable for the entire experimental period of 8 hr providing the biojet yield and selectivity of 15.3% and 28.5%, respectively. Although, this system was operated at a relatively low temperature for hydroprocessing, the productivity parameter of 0.60 kg product/Kg cat-hr was considerably higher compared to previous data.

AB  - Neat biodiesels are not preferred for use in the compression ignition (CI) engines due to their high viscosities and related operational difficulties. This study investigated the fuel properties and combustion characteristics when 2-butoxyethanol additive was mixed separately with waste cooking oil biodiesel (W100) and rapeseed oil biodiesel (R100). Compared to neat biodiesels, the viscosities (at 40 °C) of the W100 and R100 were reduced by 12.5% and 9.8% respectively, when they were blended separately with 15% 2-butoxyethanol. Four different samples such as W100, mixture of 85% W100 and 15% 2-Butoxyethanol (W85), R100, mixture of 85% R100 and 15% 2-Butoxyethanol (R85) were tested in a multi-cylinder CI engine. The thermal efficiency of the W85 fuel was higher than fossil diesel by approximately 3.7%. Total combustion duration of the biodiesel-additive blends were shorter than neat biodiesels and fossil diesel. Biodiesel-additive blends provided approximately 6% higher in-cylinder peak pressures. At full load, W85 fuel gave up to 5.4% reduced NOx emissions than neat biodiesel. The CO, HC and smoke emissions were decreased by up to 36%, 100% and 79% respectively. The study concluded that 2-butoxyethanol could effectively be used as biodiesel additive to improve fuel property; and to achieve better combustion and reduced pollution. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this paper, a complete characterization of diesel Particulate Matter (PM) in terms of mass, chemical composition, particles number, size distribution and mutagenic potential was carried out. As a test case, a Euro 5 1.3L passenger car diesel engine fueled with Ultra Low Sulphur Diesel (ULSD) and high-percentage blends (B30 − 30% vol.) of ULSD and biofuels (Rapeseed Methyl Ester, RME, and Hydrotreated Vegetables Oil, HVO) was considered. In addition, PM gravimetric analysis was compared with soot measurements carried out by means of standard laboratory equipment (e.g. smokemeters), showing a good correlation at medium and high load operating points. On the contrary, at low loads, as confirmed by thermo-gravimetric analysis, smokemeter measurements underestimated the Soluble Organic Fraction (SOF) fraction of PM, especially when for RME (B30). Then, a detailed investigation on Particles Number (PN) and size distribution was carried out, running the engine with the same fuel matrix. The results showed that adopting biofuel blends, both RME (B30) and HVO (B30), produces negligible differences in particles number distributions with respect to standard diesel. Finally, the analysis of the mutagenic potential of PM samples highlighted an increased genotoxicity for HVO (B30) and a decreased genotoxicity for RME (B30) with respect to ULSD. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the perspective of a cleaner and better world, the research of eco-responsible energy systems is an obligation. Biofuels are from the most interesting ways to reduce air pollution without major changes in nowadays vehicles technology. The paper deals with the transformation of lignocellulosic biomass derivative furfural acetone furfural into Jet and Diesel biofuel. The reaction was carried out upon a one pot process including ring opening, hydrogenation and deoxygenation. It was catalyzed by ruthenium supported on silica-alumina catalysts which were prepared and fully characterized using X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy and thermal analysis. Bare silica-alumina oxides were only able to partially or totally hydrogenate aliphatic bonds almost without oxygen removing. Whereas supported ruthenium catalysts with different loadings did lead to the production of liquid hydrocarbons with a Turnover Frequency of 0.84 hour−1 and selectivity up to 80%. A general reaction pathway was proposed including all the reaction products identified by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - With the production of renewable biofuels, concerns about the end of fossil fuels have been partially eliminated. On the other hand, the utilization of low-cost and waste materials to provide the raw essential substances to manufacture these fuels is of paramount importance. Biodiesel is one of these fuels and the required raw materials for the reaction are oil (triglycerides), alcohol and catalyst. In this work, travertine stone powder (as waste in the manufacture of building materials) was used as a catalyst and waste frying oil as a source of triglyceride for biodiesel production. Using thermogravimetric and X-ray diffraction analysis, optimum temperature for catalyst calcination was selected at 900°C. Furthermore, X-ray fluorescence, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller, transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy analyses were performed. Using the design of experiments Response Surface Methodology, the optimum reaction conditions for biodiesel production yield of 97.74% were: reaction temperature 59.52°C (~60°C), time 3.8 h (228 min), catalyst concentration 1.36 wt.% and the methanol to oil molar ratio of 11:6. After reusing four times, the catalyst efficiency was reduced a little, and the biodiesel yield was 89.84%, indicating high strength and stability of the catalyst. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - To further evaluate the compatibility of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) with the biofuels included ethanol–gasoline E30 and biodiesel B30, especially the change of mechanical properties of HDPE over soaking time, soaking tests were performed in E30 and B30 fuels at 45°C for 1608 h. Volume/mass change, yield stress, yield elongation, and impact strength of HDPE were measured at different soaking times. In all fuel soaking tests, more fuel absorption occurred between HDPE and fuels than oxidative damage. Due to higher polarity of bioethanol, E30 is less easily absorbed by HDPE than gasoline and causes less volume and mass change of HDPE. Compared with gasoline and E30, diesel and B30 were less likely to be absorbed by HDPE and there was no significant different of HDPE volume and mass change soaked in them. As fuel could be more easily stored in the amorphous phase of the HDPE than in the crystalline phase, the significant increase of yield elongation and little change of yield stress and the absorbed fuel may act as a plasticizer in HDPE. The increase of impact strength was due to the HDPE became more ductile after fuel soaking rather than strength increase. The compatibility research between HDPE and biofuel can help design engineers to evaluate the performance changes of plastic fuel tank products made of HDPE after long-term fuel soaking. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Aiming at a circular carbon economy, electrosynthesis is gaining in importance. The conversion of bioderived materials using green electrons from renewable energy sources tackles challenges like fluctuating energy production and the integration into the already existing supply networks. Herein, we discuss concepts for transforming 150-year old Kolbe chemistry into flow processes. In a recirculation setup, levulinic acid is converted to the Kolbe product 2,7-octanedione with up to 75% yield. Single-pass setups allow for continuous production, for which conversion scales linearly with contact time. It was found that non-Kolbe electrolysis is even better suited toward continuous production because of the possibility to use lower substrate concentrations. We present an example of an n-alkyl acid converted using different flow cells including a 3D printed vessel for a semibatch non-Kolbe reaction. The electrochemically more challenging β-hydroxy-acid is selectively converted to a drop-in oxygenate fuel, increasing the hourly production compared to the batch process by five times. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Using pure rapeseed oil fuel (R100) in forest machinery could be a measure that contributes to climate, water, and soil protection in forestry. However, forest machinery that is compatible with R100 is not currently available. The target of this research was to operate forest machinery with R100 in a field-test, to collect and evaluate the operational and real-world emission behaviour and to assess the environmental impact. Therefore, a modern forest harvester was modified to operate with R100 and was monitored from August 2017 until December 2018, under Bavarian working conditions. The behaviour during 2100 h of operation was mainly evaluated using information on productivity and operating fluid consumption compared to diesel fuel operation before the modifications were made. Compared to diesel fuel operation, no significant differences in the productivity of the harvester and the energy efficiency of the engine could be detected. With the fuel tempering system installed, the engine could be started at an ambient temperature as low as −20 °C. The results of the engine oil analysis and technical engine inspection after the field test indicate a failure-free operation of the engine and exhaust gas after-treatment system. Furthermore, a functional diagnosis of the harvester indicates that all of the additionally installed components were functioning and the engine, as well as the exhaust gas after-treatment system, were in an appropriate condition. The real driving emissions of nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, and carbon monoxide were measured at the beginning of and close to the end of the field test and compared to that of the harvester operating with diesel fuel. Statistical analysis showed no significant influence of the fuel type or the operation time with R100 on the emission behaviour. The emission results were well below the legal requirements for engine test stand measurements. Within the lifetime of the harvester it can be estimated that a turnover of 350,000 L of diesel fuel and 700 to 1050 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions can be avoided. For the first time, the results indicate that it is technically possible to operate a modern forest harvester with R100 (even during hard winter conditions), and this is in compliance with emission requirements and can contribute to climate, soil, and water protection. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To improve catalytic performance of metal active sites in hydrodeoxygenation and hydrocracking conversion of methyl palmitate into high-quality jet biofuel, Ni-1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate (Ni-BTC) metal-organic framework loaded on MCM-41(Mobil Composition of Matter No. 41) was prepared to enhance the accessibility of Ni active sites, facilitating hydrodeoxygenation to increase alkane yield with suitable arene content. The distance (0.98 nm) between Ni active sites within Ni-BTC structure, which was much larger than that (0.20 nm) within Ni nanoparticles, enabled methyl palmitate with maximum molecule width of 0.68 nm to go through Ni-BTC crystalline plane and get access to Ni active sites more easily. Ni-BTC nanosheets newly assembled in pore channels of MCM-41 were beneficial to effectively screen chain molecules of alkane products. With the largest BET surface area of 1014.2 m2/g, the Ni-BTC@MCM-41 catalyst with 2.5 wt% nickel (2.5Ni-BTC@MCM-41) reduced the nickel metal consumption by 75% comparing to nickel nanoparticle loading (10Ni@MCM-41), but achieved the best catalytic performances through hydrodeoxygenation on Ni active sites and hydrocracking on -SiOH acid sites. The alkane yield increased from 23.3% to 33.9%, while arene yield reduced from 22.4% to 6.5% in jet biofuel products. This resulted in an overall jet biofuel yield of 53.2% with uniform distribution along carbon numbers. The higher heating value of jet biofuel products thus increased to a peak of 45.90 MJ/kg. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - In this study, the components of Terminalia chebula plant such as leaves and seeds are effectively utilized as a green source for the synthesis of copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) and production of biodiesel, respectively. CuO NPs have been synthesized through solution combustion route using T. chebula leaves extract as a reducing-cum-fuel agent. Notably, the synthesized CuO NPs are used as a heterogeneous catalyst in the biodiesel production. The synthesized CuO NPs are characterized using XRD, FTIR, FESEM, BET, Zeta potential, DLS and UV–visible absorption spectroscopy. The obtained results showed the monoclinic crystal structure of CuO with rod-like morphology with diameter of around 100 nm. The CuO NPs were successfully utilized for the biodiesel synthesis using T. chebula oil as feedstock by varying the reaction parameters. The maximum of 97.1% yield of T. chebula methyl ester (TCME) is achieved at 3 wt% catalyst loading with methanol to oil molar ratio of 9:1 for the reaction time of 60 min at the of temperature 60 °C with constant stirring speed of 650 rpm. The CuO NPs showed a good catalytic stability up to four cycles with a slight loss in biodiesel yield. The kinetic study of TCME production fits well to the pseudo-first order reaction and the activation energy (Ea) and frequency factor (A) is found to be 40.74 kJ/mol and 5.7 × 104 min−1 respectively. Further, the TCME is also characterized by 1H NMR and FTIR. The fuel properties of TCME are also determined and found to be in the range of ASTM standards. The green chemistry metrics such as E-factor, atom economy, atom efficiency and solvent and catalyst environmental impact parameter have also been studied. Furthermore, the performance, combustion and emission characteristics of the test samples (diesel, biodiesel test blends such as B10, B20, B30, B40 and B100) on a single cylinder diesel engine have also been studied by varying the load (0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Ethanol and DME are the most promising gasoline and diesel alternative fuels among biofuels. In the present study, we conducted a numerical and comparative study of the laminar burning velocity, chemical kinetics and flame instability of DME and ethanol premixed flames at P = 1 bar, T = 408 K and equivalence ratio of 0.8–1.4. The laminar burning velocity and adiabatic flame temperature of DME are higher than ethanol at all equivalence ratios. In addition, acetaldehyde and formaldehyde are the dominant intermediate product of ethanol and DME, respectively. The peak mole fraction of H + OH + CH3 radicals correlates nearly linearly with the laminar burning velocity. The rate-of-production of DME and ethanol suggests that CH3 + O = CH2O + H is the main reaction of CH3 consumption in both DME and ethanol flames. In addition, the reverse reaction of CH3 + O = CH2O + H is enhanced to inhibit the consumption of CH3 due to the high mole fraction of CH2O in DME, which is one of the reasons that the mole fraction of CH3 in DME flame is higher than in ethanol flame. Furthermore, the hydrodynamic and diffusional-thermal instability of DME are both stronger than ethanol because of thinner flame thickness, higher thermal expansion ratio and smaller effective Lewis number. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Green diesel is one of the alternative energy sources, which is found to be a second-generation biofuel. Green diesel has a similar molecular structure to petroleum diesel but has better diesel properties, sustainability, and environmental benignity. In this study, green diesel was synthesized from waste cooking oil via a deoxygenation reaction process and blended with petroleum diesel to assess the rate of greenhouse gas emissions. The fuel properties of the formed G100 (pure green diesel) were investigated, and the performance of G5 and G20 (a mixture of 5 and 20% green diesel in petroleum diesel) was tested for combustion in an oil burner. The overall test showed that the combustion of the blends of green diesel produced lower CO2 and SO2 emissions than that of petroleum diesel as a result of the rich oxygen-free fuel content. The obtained fuel properties of pure green diesel and blended green diesel are in compliance with ASTM D6751, ASTM D240-17, and EN 14214 standards. Based on these findings, it is shown that blended green diesel is a clean fuel for the environment and a promising alternative fuel for internal combustion engines. © 2021 ACS. All rights reserved.

AB  - The carboxyl-functionalized porphyrin entangled with benzimidazolium-based ionic liquid (CFPBIL) was successfully synthesized and characterized by FT-IR, FT-NMR and TGA analysis. The proton level was determined by the Hammett acidity function, and DR spectra have been supported to confirm the band gap of photocatalyst. The present study reveals the metal-free, conventional photocatalytic acetalization of furfural to biofuel components under visible light irradiations using carboxyl-functionalized porphyrin catalyst. The effect of different parameters on the photocatalytic reaction, catalyst loading, ratio of furfural:alcohol, duration and intensity of light were investigated. The model reaction of furfural and ethanol in a home-made photoreactor using a 5-W LED presented that a very high yield of furfural acetal (92%) could be obtained under optimized conditions. Moreover, the eco-friendly method of acetalization reactions with higher alcohols (1-butanol, 1-pentanol, 1-hexanol, 1-octanol) was carried out at optimized reaction conditions which also afforded good to excellent yield of the target products, demonstrating the potential of CFPBIL as a highly active, stable and recyclable heterogeneous photocatalyst. Moreover, physical properties of biodiesel–diesel blends comprising B10, B20 and B30 were determined and furfural acetals were found as a potential fuel additive.

AB  - Recently, research organizations and researchers have been working on finding and producing clean and alternatives to fuels such as biofuels, and thus using new technologies to reduce harmful emissions such as nanoparticle technology. In this regard the use of heterogeneous catalyst for producing biodiesel is classified as a new promising technology as of its characterization for saving in the production total cost. Heterogeneous transesterification reaction is applied to change the waste cooking oil WCO triglycerides to methyl esters with applying lower concentration of alcohol, while the yielded biodiesel has fitted the ASTM norms. In the current investigation, the maximum biodiesel yield obtained was 95% at optimal reaction conditions of 60 min reaction time, 60 °C reaction temperature, 0.01 mass% TiO2 nano-catalyst, 0.3 mass% NaoH, and 1:10 V/V% oil to methanol percentage. Also, the influence of diesel, biodiesel blend, and Cadmium (II)-Based supramolecular coordination polymer nano-additives, {[Cd (EIN)2(SCN)2]}, SCP 1, on the performance and emissions of DI diesel engine were studied experimentally by varying the engine load at 1400 rpm. While the obtained results show a great reduction in UHC, CO, and NOx emissions with increasing the SCP 1 nanomaterials. However, the CO2 emissions show a unique increase in its value by adding SCP 1 as a nanoparticle. If 70 ppm of SCP 1 is used the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) has reached 31.2% as associated with the tested fuels. Also, temperature of the engine exhaust (EGT) was analyzed for all tested fuels, where a consequent reduction was observed. © 2021, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - Butanol is an important compound used as a building block for producing value-added products and an energy carrier. The main butanol production pathways are conventional acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation and catalytic upgrading of ethanol. On the other hand, the application of biomass as a promising substrate for biofuel production has been widely considered recently. However, few studies have compared different butanol production pathways using biomass as raw material. In light of that, the present work aims (i) to provide a short review of the catalytic ethanol upgrading and (ii) to compare conventional ABE fermentation and catalytic ethanol upgrading processes from the economic and environmental perspectives. Aspen Plus v9.0 was used to simulate both processes. The economic and environmental assessments were carried out considering the Colombian economic context, a gate-to-gate approach, and single impact categories. Considering a processing scale of 1000 ton/d, the conventional ABE fermentation process presented a more favorable technical, economic, and environmental performance for butanol production from biomass. It also offered lower net energy consumption (i.e., 57.9 GJ/ton of butanol) and higher butanol production (i.e., 2.59 ton/h). Nevertheless, the proposed processing scale was insufficient to reach economic feasibility for both processes. To overcome this challenge, the minimum processing scale had to be higher than 1584 ton/d and 1920 ton/d for conventional ABE fermentation and catalytic ethanol upgrading, respectively. Another critical factor in enhancing the economic feasibility of both butanol production pathways was the minimum selling price of butanol. More specifically, prices higher than 1.56 USD/kg and 1.80 USD/kg would be required for conventional ABE fermentation and catalytic ethanol upgrading, respectively. From the environmental impact point of view, the conventional ABE fermentation proc e ss led to a lower potential environmental impact than catalytic ethanol upgrading (0.12 PEI/kg vs. 0.18 PEI/kg, respectively). © 2021 Brteam.

AB  - Bio-oil is a promising source of chemicals and renewable fuels. As the liquid phase obtained from the pyrolysis of biomass, the composition and amount of bio-oil generated depend not only on the type of the biomass but also on the conditions under which pyrolysis is performed. Most fossil fuels can be replaced by bio-oil-derived products. Thus, bio-oil can be used directly or co-fed along with fossil fuels in boilers, transformed into fuel for car engines by hydrodeoxygenation or even used as a more suitable source for H2 production than biomass. On the other hand, due to its rich composition in compounds resulting from the pyrolysis of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, bio-oil co-acts as a source of various value-added chemicals such as aromatic compounds. This review presents an overview of the potential applications of bio-oils and the pyrolysis conditions under which they are obtained. Then, different extraction methods for value-added chemicals, along with the most recent developments, are discussed and future research directions for bio-oil upgrades are highlighted. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Agricultural wastes especially empty fruit bunch (EFB) are abundantly available to be utilized as a feedstock for biochemical synthesis or biofuel production. The components of the waste include lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose. Cellulose, the polymer of glucose, is the active component for producing bio-based chemicals. However, it is difficult to isolate cellulose since lignin, the most outer layer in the waste is recalcitrant. Therefore, the agricultural wastes need to be pre-treated prior to downstream processing. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of ozone pretreatment on lignin degradation and total reducing sugar (TRS) yield. EFB was pre-treated using ozone gas in a ribbon-mixer reactor. The chemical and structural changes of ozonated EFB were analysed. The highest delignification obtained were 95.7 wt.% and TRS yield was enhanced to 84.9% at a moisture content of 40 wt.% with 60 g/m3 ozone concentration within one hour of reaction time. Both NMR and FTIR spectra conferred major peaks inferring higher lignin degradation could be achieved using ozonolysis. Copyright © 2021 by Authors, Published by BCREC Group.

AB  - Advanced transportation biofuels have been the focus of intensive development since the early 2000s, and gasification in combination with synthesis technologies represents a flexible production pathway to deliver fuels for heavy-duty transport sectors that are difficult to electrify. This article is related to the pilot-scale development of a process concept aiming to smaller-scale production plants than are feasible with fluidized-bed gasifiers. Five test weeks with a total gasification time of 347 h were realized at a pilot plant that consisted of the pressurized staged fixed-bed gasifier, raw gas cooling to 500–600 °C, filtration with robust metal filters, and catalytic reforming of tars and methane. The gasifier combined an updraft primary stage and a catalytically enhanced secondary stage where most of the updraft tars were decomposed. The tar content of the product gas, 2–12 g/m3, was of the same order of magnitude as determined previously for fluidized-bed gasifiers. Consequently, similar filtration and reforming methods could be successfully applied. After the reformer, the contents of C2-hydrocarbon gases and high-molecular-weight tars were negligible. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - As fossil fuel sources are being decreasing day by day, finding renewable energy resources are necessary. Biodiesel is one of the best alternatives in diesel engines. Eruca sativa Madwort (ESM), a nonedible plant and spice of Brassica carinata family, is one of the Iranian local oil seed plants that can grow in poor and unsuitable lands and has been used as an initial source of biodiesel in this study. Transesterification of ESM’s oil has been done using KOH as catalyst and methanol with protection of molar proportion of oil to alcohol (1:6). Indirect Spray Diesel engine (Lister M8.1) is used according to ECE-49 standard and different proportions of diesel fuel and biodiesel (B0, B5, B10, B20, and B35) are selected to investigate functional parameters and exhaust emission. The results show that with the increase in the percentage of the amount of biofuel in the fuel mixture, the amount of NO, NOx, and soot contamination reduce. Also, the diesel engine has best specific fuel consumption equal to 470 g/kw.h at B20. Other basic engine parameters such as power also remain in optimal condition. Finally, it is shown that ESM has good potential to replace the diesel fuel in diesel engines, without major modification in the design of engine and injection system. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The transport sector is a crucial bottleneck in the decarbonization challenge. To study the sector’s decarbonization potential in the wider systems perspective, we couple a large-scale integrated assessment model, Regionalized Model of INvestments and Development (REMIND), to a detailed transport model, Energy Demand Generator-Transport (EDGE-T). This approach allows the analysis of mobility futures in the context of long-term and global energy sector transformations, at a high level of modal and technological granularity and internal consistency. The runtime of the coupled system increases by ~ 15–20% compared with a REMIND standalone application, and first convergence tests are promising. To illustrate the capabilities of our modeling approach, we focus on a reference pathway for Europe. Preliminary results indicate that transport service demands grow in the next decades for both passenger and freight transport. Transport system emissions are expected to decrease in the same time range, due to a shift towards electric drivetrains, advanced vehicles, more efficient modes as well as a slight increase in the share of biofuels. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The measured data (549 points) of density, (ρ), speed of sound, (u), and refractive index, (nD) are presented in this work for binary and ternary mixtures containing dibutyl ether (DBE), 1-butanol, toluene, and cyclohexane at 298.15 K and 0.1 MPa. Therefore, derivative properties such as excess volume, VE, deviation in the speed of sound, (Δu), isentropic compressibility, (ks), deviation in isentropic compressibility, (Δks), and deviation in refractive index, (ΔnD) were generated from the reported experimental data. Some of these derivative properties are fitted using the Redlich.Kister equation. Moreover, the measured data of density are modeled using the perturbed-chain statistical associating fluid theory equation of state. Intermolecular interactions between each binary and ternary mixtures have been discussed. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Researchers are looking for alternative energy sources, and biofuel from algae has a significant contribution as an alternative renewable fuel. This paper aims to evaluate fundamental running parameters (heat release rate, peak pressure, specific fuel consumption, and brake torque) and estimates the factors influencing nitrogen oxides (NOx) formation for algae biofuel-diesel blends (A-diesel). The analyses were done using a thermodynamic model and simulated with Diesel-RK and ANSYS. The numerical results of Diesel-RK and ANSYS were validated with experimental in-cylinder pressure data, and also compared with existing literature where needed. Injection timing, engine speed, and inlet temperature were selected as variables for developing the model. The engine speeds were chosen from 1400 rpm to 2500 rpm, and the injection timings were varied from 30° Before Top Dead Center (BTDC) to 20° After Top Dead Center (ATDC). Three algae biofuel blends such as 5% Algae-oil and 95% diesel (A5), 10% Algae-oil, and 90% diesel (A10), 15% Algae-oil and 85% diesel (A15), and pure diesel were considered as fuels for the analysis. The numerical findings indicate that higher inlet temperature, in-cylinder combustion temperature, and advanced injection timing are the main reasons for higher NOx formation during combustion. Among all the four fuels, algae bio-fuel blends showed lower NOx formations than conventional diesel fuel, and also, the engine performance was satisfactory. These two developed numerical models will also help researchers investigate various fundamental parameters of a diesel engine using blended fuels. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The aims of this work were (i) to develop and characterize the cheap and efficient CaO/MgO catalyst with a source of CaO from waste blood clamshell mix with MgO, and (ii) to study the catalyst efficiencies on biofuel production via continuous packed-bed reactor under atmospheric pressure without any purge gases. The chemical and physical properties of the catalyst were characterized by many techniques. The results can confirm that the ball-mill technique successfully prepared CaO and MgO catalysts. The specific surface area was increased with the increasing of Mg contents. The surface morphologies of calcined catalysts were obvious in a roughly spherical shape. The results were found that not only the Mg content was a significant effect on product and distilled yields, but also reaction temperature was a significant effect as well. The highest pyrolytic oil, derived from 10 %wt Mg catalyst with reaction temperature at 525 °C, was about 80 %, and it can be distilled almost 100 % following ASTM D86. The pyrolytic oils were purified into three types of biofuel, and then the properties of distilled products were examined. The heating values and kinetic viscosity were on standard values except for acidity. Surprisingly, the acidity was decreased comparing with raw material. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Black carbon (BC) is one of the short-lived air pollutants that contributes significantly to aerosol radiative forcing and global climate change. It is emitted by the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, biofuels, and biomass. Urban environments are quite complex and thus, the use of mobile jointly with fixed monitoring provides a better understanding of the dynamics of BC distribution in such areas. The present study addresses the measurement of BC concentration using real-time mobile and ambient monitoring in Barranquilla, an industrialized urban area of the Colombian Caribbean. A microaethalometer (MA200) and an aethalometer (AE33) were used for measuring the BC concentration. The absorption Ångström exponent (AAE) values were determined for the study area, for identifying the BC emission sources. The results of the ambient sampling show that vehicle traffic emissions prevail; however, the influence of biomass burning was also observed. The mean ambient BC concentration was found to be 1.04 ± 1.03 μg/m3 and varied between 0.5 and 4.0 μg/m3. From the mobile measurements obtained in real traffic conditions on the road, a much higher average value of 16.1 ± 16.5 μg/m3 was measured. Many parts of the city showed BC concentrations higher than 20 μg/m3. The spatial distribution of BC concentration shows that vehicle emissions and traffic jams, a consequence of road and transport infrastructure, are the factors that most affect the BC concentration. A comparison of results obtained from two aethalometers indicates that the concentrations measured by MA200 are 9% lower than those measured by AE33. The AAE obtained was found to vary between 1.1 and 1.6, indicating vehicular emissions as the most crucial source. In addition, it was observed that the BC concentration on working days was 2.5 times higher than on the weekends in the case of mobile monitoring and 1.5 times higher in the case of ambient monitoring. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Increased environmental pollution due to the organic wastes over the world is one of the most burning issues. These organic wastes lie under the category of biodegradable waste and can be effectively degraded from their complex compound into simple one by the action of microbes or other living organisms. Moreover, lignocellulosic biomass is a major part of the biodegradable waste and belongs to the group of renewable energy source, which can be very effective for bioenergy production. Biomasses are made up of different compounds such as cellulose, hemicelluloses, lignin and protein. Apart from these components, based on the structural analysis biomass also consist of bioactive substances such as carotenoids, flavonoids, lignin and antioxidants. This review explores a complete overview of the classification, component and the structure of the biomass. Moreover, it discusses how biomasses can play the key role of substrate in many sectors such as industrial bioenergy production including gaseous and liquid biofuels. © 2021, Tech Science Press.

AB  - Corncob waste management has become a concern for corn producers worldwide. Agricultural waste-based energy generation is, therefore, extensively researched these days. However, the calorific potential of the moist corncobs still remains untapped due to the lack of technological advancements. In this study, a dilute acid pre-treatment followed with enzymatic hydrolysis was used to recover 80% of the fermentable sugars from the corncobs. When used for microbial oil production in a two-stage fermentation, this enzymatic hydrolysate resulted in a lipid production of more than 75% dried cell weight (DCW) in Rhodotorula glutinis. Extracellular oil capture in this two-stage fermentation further increased the total oil production to 8 g L−1 and 80% DCW. An oleic acid-rich microbial oil profile obtained from this process exhibited excellent biofuel properties. The energy content of the microbial oil valued 40 MJ kg−1, and was found to be 2.35 times higher than the intrinsic heating capacity of corncobs. Thus, a sustainable bioprocess for corncob waste remediation was devised to obtain vegetable oil equivalent through a microbial conversion platform. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In line with global demand for greenhouse gas reduction, the aviation industry has invested in biofuels development. A source feedstock that deserves special mention for this process is microalgae, because of its cultivation of renewable biomass with high yields, low cost, and high CO2 sequestering potential. This research aimed the study of microalgae culture with hard potential for biofuel production and its obtaining through catalytic deoxygenation to renewable source hydrocarbons in C12–C18 range. Thus, the oils of the Scenedesmus acuminatus and Cosmarium sp. species were cultivated and identified. Scenedesmus acuminatus oil is the majority composition of palmitic acid (C16:0) and has a higher production and yield than Cosmarium sp. oil. Scenedesmus acuminatus oil was then submitted to catalytic deoxygenation by the semi-batch reaction using the 5% Pd/C catalyst. The obtained results showed a selectivity of 82.9% and n-alkane yielding of 36.6%, placing the specie as potential biojet fuel precursor. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

The specific objective of this work is to measure the dielectric properties (dielectric constant, loss factor, loss tangent and penetration depth) of karanja seed. The data on dielectric properties of karanja seed will be helpful to understand its microwave absorbing capacity and heating behaviour in the microwave pyrolysis process. In this work, the dielectric properties of karanja seed are determined at ambient temperature and in the frequency range 0.1–3.0 GHz. The loss tangent values of karanja seed obtained at the two recognized commercial frequencies of 915 MHz and 2.45 GHz are compared with those of some biomass available in the literature. Finally, the karanja seed is pyrolyzed in a domestic microwave oven at four different power inputs of 500 W, 600 W, 700 W and 800 W. The microwave pyrolysis characteristics of karanja seed is determined in terms of temperature variation inside the reactor and pyrolysis products yields at different power inputs. The chemical composition and fuel properties of the produced bio-oil are measured. The loss tangent of karanja seed at 2.45 GHz is 1.3, which is higher than lignocellulosic biomass like oil palm fibre (0.08). The results of the dielectric properties of the present work shows that karanja seed has better microwave absorption characteristics compared to lignocellulosic biomass. In the actual pyrolysis process in a domestic microwave oven at different power inputs, the heating rate is found to range between 0.661 and 1.157°C/s which is considerably higher than that achieved using electrical heating (0.16–0.33°C/s). The bio-oil yield increases as the power input is increased from 500 to 700 W. The maximum bio-oil yield of 47% is obtained at 700 W. The GC-MS analysis of bio-oil has shown the presence of larger amounts of hydrocarbons, esters, alcohols, very little amount of aromatics and zero sulphur-containing compounds. The fuel properties of bio-oil show that it is a non-acidic and safer fuel. The calorific value of bio-oil is 40% lower than diesel, and its viscosity is 8.5 times higher than diesel. The results reveal that the karanja seed could be pyrolyzed by microwave heating to produce bio-oil which can be used as fuel for diesel engines by suitably upgrading it by blending with diesel fuel. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Increased consumption of fossil fuels and growing concerns regarding environmental pollution triggered by burning fossil fuels have directed investigators to search for renewable fuels as an alternative. Among different opportunities explored to replace diesel as sole fuel, biodiesel produced from vegetable oils is ascertained as one of the strong contestants for lowering the exhaust emissions. In this work, experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance behavior of a four-stroke single-cylinder compression ignition diesel engine running on cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL) mixed with oxygenated additive diethyl ether (DEE) and diesel. The prepared blends are characterized for their kinematic viscosity, density, flash point, and calorific value. These blends’ effectiveness is optimized for brake thermal efficiency, brake power and specific fuel consumption considering fuel blend, % of additive addition, and injection pressure. Split-plot design in response surface methodology (RSM) is used for performing the experiments, and desirability analysis is used for optimization. The investigation outcomes show that brake thermal efficiency increases for B10 biodiesel blend and for lower injection pressure and for 15% addition of diethyl ether as additive. Similarly, specific fuel consumption is higher for blended fuel and for 10% addition of additive addition and 210 injection pressure. For all the outputs, the most influential parameter is injection pressure and its interaction effect with the type of fuel used. Finally, the optimized condition is obtained for both diesel and CNSL-DEE-diesel blend. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The hydrocracking of used cooking oil into biofuel over mesoporous silica was systematically studied. This research aims to induce the silica pores using NaHCO3 and employ the heteropore silica for the hydrocracking process of used cooking oil into biofuel. The mesoporous silica material was synthesized with various ratios of NaHCO3 and TEOS, and calcined at various temperatures. The highest acidity of mesoporous silica was obtained under the optimized conditions (NaHCO3/TEOS ratio of 1:2 and calcination temperature of 400 °C). The modification of silica led to decreasing the crystallinity, particle size, and percentage of Si and O, while increasing the pore size of the catalyst. The hydrocracking of used cooking oil over mesoporous silica with catalyst/feed ratio of 1:100 under H2 gas rate of 20 mL/min for two hours successfully produced the highest proportion of liquid yield. © 2021, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - First, second, third, and fourth-generation biofuels are continuously evolving as a promising substitute to petrodiesel catalyzed by energy depletion, economic and environmental considerations. Bio-diesel can be synthesized from various biomass sources, which are commonly divided into FAME and renewable biodiesel. FAME biodiesel is generally produced by the transesterification of vegetable oils and fats while renewable diesel is produced by hydro-deoxygenation of vegetable and waste oils and fats. The different generation, processing technologies and standards for FAME and renewable biodiesel are reviewed. Finally, the life cycle analysis and production cost of conventional and renewable biodiesel are described. © P. Vignesh et al., published by IFP Energies nouvelles, 2021.

AB  - This study investigates Marula (Sclerocarya birrea) seed oil (SBSO) as a novel feedstock for biodiesel production through the transesterification process catalysed by heterogeneous bio-alkali derived from banana (Musa acuminata) peels. Response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN) tools were used for the modelling and optimization of the process variables. The reaction process parameters considered were methanol/SBSO molar ratio, catalyst loading levels, reaction time and temperature. Central composite design (CCD) was espoused to generate 30 experimental conditions which were deployed in investigating the individual and synergetic effect of the process input variables on Sclerocarya birrea oil methyl ester (SBOME) yield. Appropriate statistical indices were adopted to investigate the predictive aptitude of the two models. Analysis shows that ANN model obtained for the transesterification process has a higher coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9846 and lower absolute average deviation (AAD) of 0.07% compared to RSM model with R2 of 0.9482 and AAD of 0.12%. The process modelling outcome also confirmed ANN performance to be more precise than RSM. At methanol/ SBSO ratio of 6:1, catalyst loading level of 2 wt%, process reaction time of 50 min and temperature of 55°C, the experimental maximum SBOME yield was observed to be 96.45 wt % following the ANN predicted yield of 96.45 wt % and RSM predicted yield of 96.65 wt % respectively. The analysed fuel properties of SBOME was found satisfactory within the biodiesel stipulated standard limit(s). The study establishes that SBSO is a good source for biodiesel production and its biodiesel methyl ester is a potential substitute for petroleum diesel and a bioenergy fuel. © 2021 by Japan Oil Chemists’ Society.

AB  - Palm oil mill effluent (POME), wastewater discharged from the palm oil refinery industry, is classified as an environmental pollutant. In this work, a heterogeneous catalytic process for biojet fuel or green kerosene production was investigated. The enzymatic hydrolysis of POME was firstly performed in order to obtain hydrolysed POME (HPOME) rich in free fatty acid (FFA) content. The variations of the water content (30 to 50), temperature (30 to 60◦C) and agitation speed (150 to 250 rpm) were evaluated. The optimal condition for the POME hydrolysis reaction was obtained at a 50% v/v water content, 40◦C and 200 rpm. The highest FFA yield (YFA) of 90% was obtained. Subsequently, FFA in HPOME was converted into hydrocarbon fuels via a hydrocracking reaction catalysed by Pd/Al2O3 at 400◦C, 10 bars H2 for 1 h under a high pressure autoclave reactor (HPAR). The refined-biofuel yield (94%) and the biojet selectivity (57.44%) were achieved. In this study, we are the first group to successfully demonstrate the POME waste valorisation towards renewable biojet fuel production based on biochemical and thermochemical routes. The process can be applied for the sustainable management of POME waste. It promises to be a high value-added product parallel to the alleviation of wastewater environmental issues. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Metal–organic framework MOF-5 was used for the first time as a heterogeneous acid catalyst for the simultaneous esterification/transesterification of two nonedible oils, waste cooking oil and Jatropha curcas oil. Fatty acid methyl ester (biodiesel) production was evaluated using an experimental central composite design. A surface response methodology allowed the determination of optimal reaction conditions in terms of methanol/oil molar ratio (3:1–45:1), reaction time (1–15 h), temperature (118–152 °C) and catalyst amount (0.1–0.9 wt%) with a variation lower than 10% with respect to the experimental yield value. The best oil to biodiesel yield conversions were 90.8% (36:1 M/O molar ratio, 12 h, 145 °C, and 0.75 wt% catalyst amount) for waste cooking oil and 88.3% (36:1 M/O molar ratio, 9.59 h, 145 °C, and 0.75 wt% catalyst amount) for Jatropha curcas oil together with respective 93.3% and 94.8% decreases in the free fatty acid content, respectively. It was also verified that the produced biodiesel meets the ASTM D6751 quality standard for some properties of the biofuel and the cost analysis of biodiesel production has also been provided. © 2021, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - In the current study, a domestic food waste containing more than 50% of carbohydrates was assessed as feedstock to produce second-generation bioethanol. Aiming to the maximum exploitation of the carbohydrate fraction of the waste, its hydrolysis via cellulolytic and amylolytic enzymatic blends was investigated and the saccharification efficiency was assessed in each case. Fermentation experiments were performed using the non-conventional yeast Pichia anomala (Wickerhamomyces anomalus) under both separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) modes to evaluate the conversion efficiencies and ethanol yields for different enzymatic loadings. It was shown that the fermentation efficiency of the yeast was not affected by the fermentation mode and was high for all handlings, reaching 83%, whereas the enzymatic blend containing the highest amount of both cellulolytic and amylolytic enzymes led to almost complete liquefaction of the waste, resulting also in ethanol yields reaching 141.06 ± 6.81 g ethanol/kg waste (0.40 ± 0.03 g ethanol/g consumed carbohydrates). In the sequel, a scale-up fermentation experiment was performed with the highest loading of enzymes in SHF mode, from which the maximum specific growth rate, µmax, and the biomass yield, Yx/s, of the yeast from the hydrolyzed waste were estimated. The ethanol yields that were achieved were similar to those of the respective small scale experiments reaching 138.67 ± 5.69 g ethanol/kg waste (0.40 ± 0.01 g ethanol/g consumed carbohydrates). © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Modifying oilseeds to obtain a desired fatty acid composition is often necessary to enable use as feedstocks for specific applications such as food processing, biofuels, or biolubricants. A mutant population of camelina (Camelina sativa), an emerging specialty oilseed crop, was screened by high-throughput gas chromatography for lines with altered seed oil fatty acid composition. By leveraging knowledge of fatty acid synthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana, mutations in orthologs of FATTY ACID ELONGASE1 (FAE1), FATTY ACID DESATURASE2 (FAD2), FATTY ACID DESATURASE3 (FAD3), and β-KETO-ACYL-ACP SYNTHASE II (KASII; FAB1) were identified. The mutations altered conserved amino acid residues in the encoded proteins. The ability of the mutations in FAE1, FAD2 and FAD3 to affect enzyme function was demonstrated by comparing in vivo activities of wild-type and mutant alleles in yeast. In addition, expression of wild-type cDNA in camelina complemented fatty acid phenotypes of these mutants. As camelina has a hexaploid genome, the effect of a mutation in one of the three homeologs for each gene resulted in no or less severe growth phenotypes compared to similar mutations in Arabidopsis. Mid-oleic oils with nearly 40 % oleic acid and reduced very long-chain (≤C20) fatty acid content were obtained by crossing to obtain a fae1c/fad2a/fae1a/fad3a quadruple mutant. Little effect on total seed oil content was observed in the stacked mutant line. The resulting mid-oleic acid oil had improved oxidative stability due to reductions in polyunsaturated fatty acid content, increasing its utility for biofuels and other applications. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Siberian apricot (Prunus sibirica L.), an excellent woody oil plant unique to Asia, is well known for its ability to produce high-oil seeds for use as a promising feedstock of biodiesel. Based on the investigation of natural Siberian apricot resources in China in the early stage, seeds of Siberian apricot from 74 geographic provenances which can fully reflect the overall information were collected. In this research, seeds oil content, fatty acid composition and biodiesel properties were evaluated, and the key environmental factors that caused the variation of these in different geographic provenance were analyzed. The oil content of Siberian apricot seeds is 45.48%–61.07%, and the average was 50.95% for all provenances. The characteristics of oil can identify and quantify eight fatty acids. The most abundant fatty acids were oleic acid (C18:1; 54.02%–76.54%), followed by linoleic acid (C18:2; 16.78%–38.49%) and erucic acid (C16:0; from 3.27% to 6.12%). Monounsaturated fatty acids are the most abundant in 54.75%–77.03% compared with saturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids. The biodiesel properties of most provenance seeds meet the standards of the ASTM D6751 and GB/T 20828, and a few meet the standards of the EN14214. Through the clustering of oil content and fatty acid composition and the analysis of biodiesel properties indexes, it is concluded that KSK provenance is the most suitable for biodiesel production. The XBZ, HHE, AES, ZLQ and LD provenances may be preserved as potential biodiesel. RDA and VPA showed that the effects of environmental factors on the oil properties of Siberian apricot were ranked as terrain factor > climate factor > soil factor, among which longitude, latitude and altitude are the main terrain indicators. These evaluations can provide reference for the effective utilization and further development of Siberian apricot as a bioenergy feedstock. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Industrial research departments and chemical engineering institutes have begun to adopt additive manufacturing technologies, such as stereolithography for producing special types of reactors for continuous production. Microreactors have been widely used to improve the mass and heat transfer processes between immiscible liquid-liquid phases, but with the disadvantage of requiring sophisticated technology for their manufacture. In this paper, an approach for producing millireactors by stereolithography and rapid optimization of millireactor design with circular cross-section is presented. Transesterification of vegetable oils with alcohols is widely used method for biodiesel synthesis, generally taking place in a batch reactor. Microreactors due to their short residence times and high biodiesel yields are currently being explored for continuous production, but have disadvantages in low production volumes and high pressure drops. To overcome above-mentioned problems, millireactors with channel diameters from 1.5 mm to 3.5 mm were produced in order to investigate the impact of channel dimensions on conversion of sunflower oil to fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). Transesterification reaction of sunflower oil using methanol with addition of KOH base catalyst to FAME was monitored by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, gas chromatography, and nuclear magnetic resonance. Results show that millireactors with smaller channel dimensions and processes with higher temperatures at certain residence times can be used to achieve better biodiesel yield in much shorter time than batch reactors. In addition, continuous way of FAME production in millireactors is presented. Production in millireactors provided an improvement when compared to microreactors because they have low pressure drops and higher production volumes. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The monitoring of biodiesel production processes is currently performed by methods requiring high reagent consumption and long response times. Aiming to overcome these drawbacks, this article developed chemometric models combining principal component analysis (PCA), multivariate curve resolution alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) and mid infrared spectroscopy to determine simultaneously the concentrations of the main components, methyl esters and triglycerides, along transesterification reactions. This methodology also tried to model the intermediates (fatty acids plus monoglycerides, and diglycerides), thus providing semi-quantitative predictions for these components. These reactions were carried out in different experimental conditions according to a factorial design with two factors, the batch of soybean oil (raw material) and the alcohol:oil molar ratio. The concentration values estimated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), as the reference method, were the inputs for the correlation constraint used as a key step in the multivariate calibration MCR-ALS models. The spectral profiles recovered for the methyl esters and for the triglycerides have shown high correlations (greater than 0.985) in comparison to the reference spectra. In addition, the spectra calculated for fatty acids, monoglycerides and diglycerides showed absorption bands characteristic of functional groups present in these molecules, mainly the hydroxyl and carbonyl stretching bands. The root mean square errors of calibration and prediction estimated for the triglycerides and for the methyl esters were within the range from 1.9% to 6.3%. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Kitchen waste (KW) has gradually become a prominent problem in municipal solid waste treatment. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a promising method used to make fuel oil from food and KW. However, the upgrading of bio-oil is particularly important for the sake of industrial reuse. In this study, the KW from university restaurants was subjected to HTL experiments in order to study theoretical feasibility. With the change of conversion temperature and residence time, the optimal conversion working conditions in this study were determined according to the quality and yield of the bio-oil. Moreover, the bio-oil upgrading effects of different additives (hydrogen chloride, sodium hydroxide, and iron(III) chloride) on the HTL of KW were studied. Alkaline additives have an inhibitory effect on the bio-oil yield and positive effect on coke yield. Acidic additives and iron (Fe)-containing additives can promote bio-oil yield. As an important aspect of upgrading, the effect on the nitrogen content of bio-oil with additives was revealed. The alkaline and Fe-containing additives have little effect on reducing the viscosity of the bio-oil while with the appropriate ratio (2.5 mol•kg−1) of acidic additives to the raw material, the static and dynamic fluidity of the oil phase products are reduced to about 0.1 Pa•s. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The feasibility of using intermittent cycle extended aeration system (ICEAS) sludge as a lipid feedstock for biodiesel production was investigated. The main effects of in situ transesterification parameters, reaction temperature (30–70 °C), reaction time (4–24 h), catalyst concentration (1–5% v/v), and proportion of methanol to dry sludge (5–25 ml/g) at five-levels as well as their simultaneous interactions were evaluated to develop an empirical model. Optimized conditions were obtained at 60 °C, 4.65% (v/v) H2SO4, 17.84 h reaction time, and 5:1 methanol to dry sludge proportion (ml/g), leading to a maximum of 18.58% (w/w) biodiesel yield with 94.23% fatty acid methyl ester content. This result was higher in comparison with yields derived from conventional activated sludge, membrane bioreactor and anaerobic-anoxic-oxic processes. The ICEAS technology advantages are owned to its different configurations leading to production of one blended sludge, shorter hydraulic retention time and higher chemical oxygen demand to nitrogen ratios. The predominance of fatty acid methyl esters such as palmitic, oleic, palmitoleic, stearic, linoleic and myristic acid methyl ester, in the obtained biodiesel, indicated suitability of ICEAS sludge as feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2020

AB  - The growing demand for inexpensive, environmentally benign fuels has sparked research into fuel properties that affect fuel production, handling and engine efficiency. Reid vapor pressure (RVP) has been shown to be one such important fuel property. Having models that can accurately predict the RVP of a fuel rapidly and robustly can aid in the design of de novo fuels and increase the value proposition to the refinery. Conventional fossil fuels typically consist of 100 s of highly non-ideal components, especially when oxygenates are involved, and current methods often fail to predict RVP correctly. The large number of components can render conventional modelling approaches burdensome and inaccurate. To overcome these barriers, a robust methodology for the rapid and accurate prediction of the RVP of complex base fuels blended with oxygenated biofuels via surrogate models was developed. The aim was to minimize the number of components necessary to accurately represent the complex mixture, whilst retaining the ability to accurately predict RVP of the base fuel. Three models were developed using the SAFT-γ approach, which varied in complexity and accuracy of prediction. The RVP for a suite of oxygenates, blended at 10, 20, and 30%, by weight into blendstocks for oxygentated blending (BOB) was studied in order to evaluate which oxygenate families have potential to reduce RVP. The majority of oxygenates evaluated decreased the RVP of the mixture, with the branched alcohols and the ketones showing the largest decrease. These results have promising implications for biofuels development and biorefinery economics. © 2020

AB  - There have been several works on criteria emissions from biofuels and their mixtures. In this study, the focus is on emissions of non-criteria pollutants, in particular polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their nitrated (nitro-PAHs) and alkylated analogs (alkyl-PAHs). The determinations were made using a standard engine from the fleet of vans used in Brazilian towns and cities operating at 700, 1200 and 1500 rpm and with pure commercial diesel and mixtures of 7, 10, 15 and 20% biodiesel. Sampling was performed with a 10-stage cascade impactor and the selected items were grouped into coarse, fine, ultrafine and nano particles. Chemical analyses were conducted using gas phase chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC MS) detection with large volume injection. The results show that emissions from all PAHs increase with engine speed by 18.1% from 700 to 1200 rpm and by 88.7% from 700 to 1500 rpm. It was observed that there was a reduction of total PAHs from 700 to 1500 rpm when there was an increase in biodiesel content. However, this has the undesirable effect of increasing the nitro-PAHs when there is a greater amount of biodiesel in the mixture, which may be because the rise in NOx emissions can cause a reaction with PAHs. High correlations were observed between the emissions of PAHs and alkyl-PAHs (0.90) and between PAHs and nitro-PAHs (0.67) which suggests the formation mechanisms of these compounds might be similar. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper aims at analysing the utilisation of biodiesel for the case of bus rapid transit system (BRTS) in Ahmedabad, India, through the social benefit cost analysis (SBCA) and life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) tools. The SBCA and the LCCA have been performed for diesel and biodiesel blends B0, B5, B10, B15, B20, B30, B50 and B100. The study reveals that the overall social benefit cost ratio is close to 0.7 for diesel-based transit and can be marginally improved to 0.77 by adding biodiesel in various proportions. Given the easy transition of diesel-based transit to biodiesel-based transit coupled with improvement in benefit cost ratio, it is suggested to transition from diesel to biodiesel blended fuel. However, since the benefit cost ratio is less than 1.0, a need for alternative financial model development is identified. It is also deducted that the fuel conversion is one way to sustainable development, however, looking to the nature of social benefits; the step to development of BRTS instead of conventional bus transport can also aid sustainable development in a major way. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Biodiesel, fatty acid methyl ester (FAME), is an environmentally friendly alternative fuel produced by transesterification of renewable lipid feedstocks for diesel engines. Methanolysis of waste frying oil (WFO) was catalyzed by Rhizopus stolonifer 1aNRC11 mutant F whole-cell lipase that produced under solid state fermentation (SSF) using wheat bran (WB) and black cumin meal as the main substrate. Cultivation SSF parameters of R. stolonifer mutant were optimized using Plackett-Burman (PB) experimental design and Face-centred Central Composite Design (FCCD), taking FAME yield as a response for whole-cell lipase production ability. PB results showed that cultivation temperature, medium pH and moisture content were the most significant parameters, which were selected for optimization by FCCD. The optimal determined conditions were as follows: WB (10 g), black cumin meal (6%, w/w of WB), fodder yeast (1%, w/w of WB), moisture content (1.5 g water/g solid), inoculum size (3 discs), initial pH (8), and cultivation time (4 day) at 28 °C. With R. stolonifer mutant cultivated in the optimized conditions, the FAME yield reached 82.6% that was close to the predicted yield of 85.7%. The analysis of variance showed that the model was statistically significant (p value of.0001) and could explain 89% of the variability in the response. These results indicated that the optimization conditions increased biodiesel production by about 43% compared to the basal medium (57.60%). The optimization of SSF conditions using low cost components makes the whole-cell lipase production process from the R. stolonifer 1aNRC11 mutant F economically effective for application in biodiesel production from WFO. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - To obtain high-quality biofuel, bio-oil obtained from fast pyrolysis of woody biomass was pretreated with ion exchange resin (amberlyst 36) at 50°C, 100°C, and 150°C, and then the recovered liquid product was upgraded using hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) with Pt/C at 300°C. After the two-stage upgrading, 4 types of products (gas, light oil, heavy oil, and char) were obtained. Two-immiscible liquid products were consisted of organic heavy oil, derived from bio-oil, and aqueous light oil, based on the ethanol. The mass balances of the HDO products were influenced by the pretreatment temperature. Ion exchange pretreatment of bio-oil was effective in reducing the char formation during the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) process. The pretreatment also improved the following heavy oil properties: the water content, heating value, viscosity, acidity, and oxygen level. As a parameter used to indicate the biofuel acidity, the total acid number (TAN) value, was clearly reduced from 114.5 (bio-oil) to 34.1–78.2 (heavy oils). Furthermore, the water and oxygen contents of bio-oil (21.1 and 52.6 wt%, respectively) declined after the pretreatment followed by HDO (ranged 5.1–6.9 and 19.0–25.5 wt%, respectively), thereby improving its higher heating value (HHV) from 17.2 MJ/kg (bio-oil) to 26.2–28.1 MJ/kg (heavy oils). The degree of deoxygenation (DOD) increased as the pretreatment temperature decreased, and the highest energy efficiency (79.8%) was observed after pretreatment at 100°C. In terms of catalyst deactivation during the reaction, both carbon deposition and surface cracking intensified with increasing pretreatment temperatures. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz (family Brassicaceae) or false flax, a new oilseed plant for biodiesel and jet fuel production, has been cultivated for centuries in the temperate climate belt of Europe, as an annual summer or winter crop. Camelina is gaining popularity because of its low input requirements and its possibility of being used as a low greenhouse gas emission biofuel crop. Consecutive agronomic trials were carried out in northeast India (Assam), which is characterized by a sub-tropical climate. Three genotypes were used for the study. Comparisons at agronomic, physiological and biochemical levels were carried out. Results demonstrate that Camelina could grow and produce seeds in northeast India only during the winter season (October to March) when precipitation was absent, and the temperature was comparable to that of the temperate European belt in spring–summer. The oil quality and quantities showed small changes and remain in a suitable range for biofuel production. We infer that Camelina sativa has a high level of plasticity and ability to adapt in an area outside of its original habitat and can be cultivated in winter, as a second crop, in northeast India to provide a valuable feedstock for biofuel producers. © 2019 Council of Scientific & Industrial Research, India.

AB  - The effect of adding metal-based additives for improving the emission characteristics of biodiesel has been used of late for in unmodified diesel engine. However, analysis on the influence of adding the oxygenated additive on emission aspects has received little attention. This work examines the impact of propyl alcohol addition to mahua oil biodiesel (MOBD) in a diesel engine to view its effect on emission characteristics. Two fuel blends were prepared with different concentrations of biodiesel and oxygenated additives such as 95% mahua biodiesel + 5% propyl alcohol and 90% mahua biodiesel + 10% propyl alcohol (MOBD90P10). Results indicated that MOBD subjected to the addition of propyl alcohol (MOBD90P10 and MOBD90P10) has 11.39%, 3.81%, 7.99% and 5.3% decrease in CO, HC, NOx and smoke emission when compared to MOBD. Further, the modified fuel required no modifications in engine design while in operation. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the density and viscosity of ternary biodiesel blends. Fuel density and viscosity play an important role in the fuel injection system, flame propagation, and combustion process in compression ignition engine. The density and viscosity of biodiesel are higher than high-speed diesel which is an implication in the commercialization of biodiesel. In the present study, palm oil has been used for the production of biodiesel through the ultrasound-assisted transesterification process. Three different types of fuel additives including butanol, dimethyl carbonate, and plastic oil have been used for the preparation of nine ternary biodiesel blends. The density and viscosity of individual fuels and ternary biodiesel were measured experimentally in a temperature range of 281.51 K–348.15 K. For the prediction of density and viscosity of ternary biodiesel blends, four density and viscosity models were developed. The prediction accuracy of these developed models was assessed by a statistical tool absolute percentage error (APE). Newly proposed exponential regression models predicted well compared to experimental data for density and viscosity values with high regression coefficient 0.9995 and 0.9841 and lower mean absolute percentage of error 0.012 % and – 0.516 % at (348.15 K) temperature respectively. These correlations are significant for the automobile industry in developing fuel pipeline and transport equipment where additives would be present in diesel-biodiesel fuel blends. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Cumulative reported evidence has indicated that renewable feedstocks are a promising alternative source to fossil platforms for the production of fuels and chemicals. In that regard, the development of new, highly active, selective, and easy to recover and reuse catalysts for biomass conversions is urgently needed. The combination of enzymatic and inorganic heterogeneous catalysis generates an unprecedented platform that combines the advantages of both, the catalytic efficiency and selectivity of enzymes with the ordered structure, high porosity, mechanical, thermal and chemical resistance of mesoporous materials to obtain enzymatic heterogeneous catalysts. Enzymatic mineralization with an organic silicon precursor (biosilicification) is a promising and emerging approach for the generation of solid hybrid biocatalysts with exceptional stability under severe use conditions. Herein, we assessed the putative advantages of the biosilicification technology for developing an improved efficient and stable biocatalyst for sustainable biofuel production. Results: A series of solid enzymatic catalysts denominated LOBE (low ordered biosilicified enzyme) were synthesized from Pseudomonas fluorescens lipase and tetraethyl orthosilicate. The microscopic structure and physicochemical properties characterization revealed that the enzyme formed aggregates that were contained in the heart of silicon-covered micelles, providing active sites with the ability to process different raw materials (commercial sunflower and soybean oils, Jatropha excisa oil, waste frying oil, acid oil from soybean soapstock, and pork fat) to produce first- and second-generation biodiesel. Ester content ranged from 81 to 93% wt depending on the raw material used for biodiesel synthesis. Conclusions: A heterogeneous enzymatic biocatalyst, LOBE4, for efficient biodiesel production was successfully developed in a single-step synthesis reaction using biosilicification technology. LOBE4 showed to be highly efficient in converting refined, non-edible and residual oils (with high water and free fatty acid contents) and ethanol into biodiesel. Thus, LOBE4 emerges as a promising tool to produce second-generation biofuels, with significant implications for establishing a circular economy and reducing the carbon footprint. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Multivariable component analysis is one of the most challenging topics in the area of microwave resonator based sensors. In this article, a new approach is developed for introducing new independent features for analyzing the volumetric fraction of water, ethanol, and gasoline in E85 biofuel samples. The novel features are extracted based on a multiharmonics measurement of frequency and amplitude variations of the transmission response of the resonator over multiple harmonics due to nonlinearity and uniqueness of the permittivity spectrum of different materials. For the experiments, 60 samples of biofuel mixtures are prepared with randomly chosen percentages of each of the components. An artificial neural network is trained with the extracted features from 40 of the samples and tested over the remaining 20 samples. The average relative error in determining the water concentration in the biofuel samples of as low as 0.09% is achieved. The experimental results verify the capability of the sensor for selective analysis of all the components of a multivariable mixture simultaneously. © 1982-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The production of chemicals and fuels from renewable biomass with the primary aim of reducing carbon footprints has recently become one of the central points of interest. The use of lignocellulosic biomass for energy production is believed to meet the main criteria of maximizing the available global energy source and minimizing pollutant emissions. However, before usage in bioenergy production, lignocellulosic biomass needs to undergo several processes, among which biomass pretreatment plays an important role in the yield, productivity, and quality of the products. Acid-based pretreatment, one of the existing methods applied for lignocellulosic biomass pretreatment, has several advantages, such as short operating time and high efficiency. A thorough analysis of the characteristics of acid-based biomass pretreatment is presented in this review. The environmental concerns and future challenges involved in using acid pretreatment methods are discussed in detail to achieve clean and sustainable bioenergy production. The application of acid to biomass pretreatment is considered an effective process for biorefineries that aim to optimize the production of desired products while minimizing the by-products. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper investigates the authenticity of the biofuels as an alternative to Jet A fuel. Owing to the fact of reduced CO2 emission quality, biofuels can be used in the field of aviation to substantially reduce the CO2 emission and improve the performance. In this analysis, microalgae Spirulina biofuel was added with Jet-A fuel at different proportions such as 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100%. The proportions used are B20% (20% biofuel with 80% jet-A fuel), B40% (40% biofuel with 60% Jet-A fuel), B60% (60% biofuel with 40% Jet-A fuel), B80% (80% biofuel with 20% Jet-A fuel) and B100% biofuel. All the test results were compared with the neat jet A fuel. The experiments were conducted at different engine speeds. A small experimental jet engine was used to conduct all the experimental tests. Engine performance characteristics and emission characteristics were found for different fuel blends. It is concluded that the biofuel at a lower proportion level with the Jet–A fuel comparatively produced a good result. In terms of thrust and engine speed, the lower level of addition of biofuel is fruitful. The emission level of CO, CO2, and NOx was reduced owing to the presence of excess oxygen content in the blends. However, when the addition percentage was increased, the results produced by them were not positive because of its low energy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this present study, biodiesel was produced from an eco-friendly and non-edible AMC seed oil using a biocatalyst. The optimum biodiesel yield was obtained as 92% by undergoing microwave transesterification with 20 min time, 4.5 wt% catalyst amount and 1:12 oil-methanol ratio at 55 °C. The activation energy needed for the reaction was 51.9 kJ/mol. The thermodynamic parameters for the transesterification process, such as enthalpy and entropy were 56.4 kJ/mol and −0.091 kJ/mol. Further, the engine studies were carried out for different fuel injection pressures and injection timing. Performance results reveal that BSEC and BTE of biodiesel are lower and higher than that of diesel fuel for 400 bar FIP and 27° CA bTDC FIT at full load respectively. However, except NO, composite emissions of CO, UBHC and dry soot are comparatively lesser than that of standard emission norms. It is thereby inferred from the experimental results that the optimum fuel injection pressure and timing are 400 bar and 27° CA bTDC. The developed ANN model precisely predicted the out data with a higher R2 value for biodiesel synthesis and engine characteristics. Hence, it can be concluded that ANN is the best tool for predicting output data. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A detailed investigation of the physicochemical properties and thermal characteristics of argan fruit residues (AFRs) was carried out to identify their potential application as biofuels. This experimental study covered the four main by-products of argan fruit: argan pulp (AP), argan nut shell (ANS), argan oilcake (AOC) and argan deoiled cake (ADC). Physicochemical analysis was performed to characterize biomass-based materials. Thermogravimetric techniques (TG, DTG and DTA) were applied to assess structural decomposition, biomass reactivity and combustion parameters. Lastly, thermal conductivity and diffusivity between 25 and 100 °C were measured using the transient plane source technique (TPS). The study shows that heating values were in the range of 17–22.5 MJ kg−1, which is comparable to those of wood pellets and lignite coal. The maximum ash content was found in AP and the minimum in ANS. The residual oil of AOC was found to affect the drying process and calorific value. Thermal analysis showed that ANS has the highest ignition temperature and thermal conductivity values and therefore appears to be the most reactive material. Our data show that ANS has a good potential to produce heat through direct combustion. A pretreatment appears to be necessary to improve the characteristics of AP and AOC in order to make them suitable biofuels in the near future. © 2020, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - Black carbon (BC) as an important part of atmospheric aerosols imposes adverse effects on atmospheric visibility, health, and climate change. Mass absorption cross-section (MACBC) is an essential parameter in BC quantitative and model research, which is of growing concern in recent decades. In this study, we conducted real-world measurements on BC emissions from two major sources of residential biofuel stoves and diesel trucks. BC emissions and MACBC values are quantified based on the photoacoustic and thermo-optical methods. The impacts of typical factors from biofuel stoves (biofuel and stove types) and diesel trucks (vehicle types, emission standards, and driving conditions) on BC/EC, MACBC values, and the relationships between BC and EC, BC/PM2.5 and MACBC are analyzed comprehensively. We find the BC and EC emissions from these two sources present good correlations, and those emissions are almost equal from diesel trucks, while the EC emissions from biofuel burning are slightly higher than BC. The typical factors for analysis may affect the optical properties of BC, and then will affect the mass ratio of BC/EC, indirectly. We have calculated the equivalent MACBC values and compared those with previous studies. Then, we further divided the equivalent MACBC values under several typical factors, which are 5.84 and 2.71 m2/g for improved and simple biofuel stoves, and 5.91 and 4.64 m2/g for light-duty and heavy-duty diesel trucks, respectively. Furthermore, the MACBC and BC/PM2.5 under the main operational metrics generally present good correlations. Our results will help to enhance the understanding of MACBC and provide effective data support for BC quantification and atmospheric model research. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Fourth generation (4G) biofuels have been found compatible with engines, storage systems, and transport facilities. Due to advances in synthetic biology and genetic engineering tools, considerable progress has been made in producing 4G biofuels including high-carbon alcohols, long-chain hydrocarbons, terpenoids-based, and/or fatty-acid derived biofuels using Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia pastoris, Yarrowia lypolytica, and Zymomonas mobilis as microbial cellular factories. However, these microbial platforms face various challenges including low product titers, low product yields, difficult product recovery incurring intensive energy consumption, and discharge of large amounts of wastewater. All these issues make the production and recovery of these biofuels expensive and commercially non-competitive. However, various genetic manipulation approaches including overexpression of heat-shock proteins, enhanced production of precursor molecules, regulating redox-balance, and membrane engineering have been employed to cope with these challenges. This review discusses the progress made in the molecular approaches for the enhanced biosynthesis and easier recovery of these biofuels through employing the secreting microbial cell factories. Besides, based on the data published on membrane transporters in previous fifteen years, selected fungal and bacterial membrane efflux pumps are studied to evaluate their biofuel secretion potential as future targets to be employed in the biofuel secreting microbial cell factories to achieve commercial robustness in the future. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Due to severe geopolitical uncertainty, tensions between nations that produces fuel/oil, and trade sanctions, almost no nation can guarantee a consistent fuel supply and that can affect the progress or development of countries significantly as fuel is the backbone of the energy supply. Counties are exploring different alternative energy sources that can be sustainable and locally available. Waste-based biofuel, i.e., biodiesel, can be an excellent cheap alternative to diminish the fuel supply–demand conflict and can also play an important role in mitigating the adverse effects of greenhouse gas emissions in the environment. This study focuses on four biodiesel feedstocks that are classified as having the most potential (microalgae oil), being the most prevalent (palm oil), the most popular (soybean oil), and the most proven (coconut oil) identified by the current researchers. The Scopus research database recognises these biodiesel feedstocks. The ranking among these studied biodiesel feedstocks is focused on technical, economic, environmental, and social aspects with eighteen criteria. There are five weighting methods used in this study, namely EQUAL, Criteria importance through intercriteria correlation (CRITIC), ENTROPY, Analytical hierarchical process (AHP), and Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process (FAHP). Five multiple criteria decision analysis processes, namely PROMETHEE, Weighted sum method (WSM), Weighted product method (WPM), Technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), and VIse Kriterijumska Optimizacija Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) are applied for ranking these feedstocks. The results reveal that Coconut oil rated the best followed by Microalgae and Palm oil, whereas Soybean was considered to be the worst performer among those feedstocks. This ranking of biodiesel feedstocks is important for commercialisation purposes as well as providing a clear picture to the researchers, scientists, policymakers, and Government stakeholders. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Cyclopentanol is a novel biofuel with high resistance to auto-ignition, which can be used as a promising additive to gasoline fuel. It is of great importance to gain a comprehensive understanding on the oxidation chemistry of cyclopentanol. The reaction of cyclopentanol with hydroxyl radical plays an important role in both combustion and atmospheric chemistry. In this study, we calculate the rate constants of cyclopentanol reaction with hydroxyl radical over a wide temperature range of 200–2500 K, using multistructural canonical variational transition state theory. The effects of variational, quantum tunneling and multistructural torsional anharmonicity were analyzed. The results show that the variational and multistructural torsional anharmonicity effects play a key role, while the quantum tunneling effect is nearly negligible for the studied reaction system. Moreover, the rate constants of reactions with submerged forward barrier heights show a non-monotonic behavior, while a positive temperature dependence is found for the rate constants of reactions with positive forward barrier heights. Our calculated total rate constants are in good agreement with those estimated in the literature (Cai et al., CNF, 2019), however, significant discrepancies are observed in the branching ratios of reaction channels. The rate constants reported in this study are expected to be more accurate and will benefit the understanding on the oxidation chemistry of cyclopentanol. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Generation of energy is a vital process for sustenance of human life. Quality of human life is undoubtedly linked to the efficient generation and use of energy. The choice of alternative fuels is of the utmost significance due to the decline of fossil fuel reserves and their effect on global warming. One of the most important areas of research all over the world is the generation and distribution of sustainable energy. There are, in fact, many sustainable fuel resources. In this study, we describe the problem of selecting alternate fuel using novel types of hesitant multi criteria decision-making equation methods. The considered fuel systems are Electricity, natural gas, biodiesel, ethanol, and propane. In the selection of alternative fuels, quantity, quality of performance, cost, and efficiency among others, have to be taken into account. The alternatives selected should, for example, increase the speed of buses, and provide for greater mileage while and not affecting the environment. Here, the DEMATEL (Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory Model) method is used to determine the weights of the criteria and the COPRAS (Complex Proportional Assessment) method is used to calculate the ranking of the alternatives. The main objective of this research paper is to select the best alternative, based on environmental safety, CO2 emission level, technical cost, and fuel cost. Thus a better alternative is selected with the selected alternatives and criteria. The results of this research are summarized as follows. These are natural gas ( R2 ) &gt; propane ( R5 ) &gt; biodiesel ( R3 ) &gt; electricity ( R1 ) &gt; ethanol (R4 ). The numeric values of these selected alternatives are R2=1&gt;R5=0.5215&gt;R3=0.4904&gt;R1=0.4887&gt;R4=0.3299. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Wet ethanol is a biofuel with unique fuel properties: a high latent heat of vaporization and low equivalence ratio sensitivity. These two fuel properties enable control over the heat release process in low temperature combustion through the enhancement of in-cylinder thermal stratification. In this work, it is shown that the direct injection of wet ethanol 80 (80% ethanol, 20% water, by mass) during the intake stroke on a mid-compression ratio engine with a side-mounted gasoline direct injector does not fully premix with incoming air, leaving stratification in the cylinder which elongates the combustion process, enabling high-load low temperature combustion without engine-damaging knock. As a result, the load under naturally aspirated conditions was only limited by oxygen content as the global equivalence ratio approached stoichiometry. The results show that swirl can not only modulate the induced stratification effectively by increasing the amount of bulk motion in the cylinder but also cause a thermal efficiency penalty, since swirl increases heat transfer losses. Modulation over the induced stratification can be achieved without an efficiency penalty by employing either a dual injector system where a fraction of the total fuel is injected into the port or a split injection strategy where a fraction of the total fuel is injected during the compression stroke. This strategy enables high-load low temperature combustion, while reducing the number of regions that form NOx and avoiding excessively rich regions that contribute to combustion inefficiency. © IMechE 2020.

AB  - The negative impact of transport on climate has led to incentives to increase the amount of renewable fuels used in internal combustion engines (ICEs). Oxygenated, liquid biofuels are promising alternatives, as they exhibit similar combustion behaviour to gasoline. In this article, the effect of the different biofuels on engine efficiency, combustion propagation and emissions of a gasoline-optimised direct injected spark ignited (DISI) engine were evaluated through engine experiments. The experiments were performed without any engine hardware modifications. The investigated fuels are gasoline, four alcohols (methanol, ethanol, n-butanol and iso-butanol) and one ether (MTBE). All fuels were tested at two speed sweeps at low and mid load conditions, and a spark timing sweep at low load conditions. The oxygenated biofuels exhibit increased efficiencies, even at non-knock-limited conditions. At lower loads, the oxygenated fuels decrease CO, HC and NOx emissions. However, at mid load conditions, decreased volatility of the alcohols leads to increased emissions due to fuel impingement effects. Methanol exhibited the highest efficiencies and significantly increased burn rates compared to the other fuels. Gasoline exhibited the lowest level of PN and PM emissions. N-butanol and iso-butanol show significantly increased levels of particle emissions compared to the other fuels. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This work aims to convert waste cooking oil (WCO) into biofuel through a catalytic cracking process. The process of catalytic cracking was catalyzed using activated carbon loaded with iron and manganese ions. Cellulosic waste, as an eco-friendly, cheap, and renewable resource, was used to prepare the activated carbon. FTIR, XRD, TGA, differential thermal analysis, and N2-adsorption/desorption investigations were applied to characterize the prepared catalysts. Characterization of the obtained biofuels was established according to ASTM standard specifications. The engine tests of the different blends of biofuels-traditional diesel were performed. The obtained data confirmed that the biofuel blend contained 10% biofuel (B10) decreased the brake-specific fuel consumption from 651 g/kw.h for regular diesel to 554 g/kw, and raised the thermal brake efficiency from 15% to 17.4%. Therefore, a biofuel-petroleum fuel blend at 10% of biofuel can be presented as a promising fuel blend for the petroleum diesel. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - High emissions of particulate matter from diesel engines presents a serious risk to human health and the environment. The addition of oxygenated molecules to diesel fuels has been shown to reduce soot formation during combustion. Polyoxymethylene ethers (POMEs) are a novel class of oxygenated molecules that can be produced from biomass and that have the potential to be used as soot-reducing diesel fuel blendstocks. However, only a few variations of these molecules have been studied thus far, and those that have been characterized present significant disadvantages that could compromise current liquid fuel systems and diesel engines. Using a variety of structure–activity models, we evaluated 67 POMEs to predict the effects of structural variations on important fuel properties. Prediction accuracy was assessed by comparing predictions with measurements for a subset of structures. Nine POME molecules were identified as having potential to reduce soot formation by over 75% compared to conventional diesel fuels while being compatible with current liquid fuel infrastructure, maintaining optimal engine performance, and presenting a minimal risk to the environment. None of these nine POMEs has been previously identified as a potential diesel blendstock. This is the first evaluation of POMEs as a class of molecules and the results guide research on the synthesis, properties, and engine performance of POMEs. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - By extracting lignin, pulp production can be increased without heavy investments in a new recovery boiler, the typical bottleneck of a pulp mill. The extraction is performed by using 0.20 and 0.15 weight equivalents of CO2 and H2SO4 respectively. Herein, we describe lignin esterification with fatty acids using benign reagents to generate a lignin ester mixable with gas oils. The esterification is accomplished by activating the fatty acid and lignin with acetic anhydride which can be regenerated from the acetic acid recycled in this reaction. The resulting mass balance ratio is fatty acid/lignin/acetic acid (2 : 1 : 0.1). This lignin ester can be hydroprocessed to generate hydrocarbons in gasoline, aviation, and diesel range. A 300-hour continuous production of fuel was accomplished. By recirculating reagents from both the esterification step and applying a water gas shift reaction on off-gases from the hydroprocessing, a favorable overall mass balance is realized. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Biodiesel fuel applications can be found in several sectors, including transport, power generation, industry, and commerce. Biodiesel has a high density, viscosity, and acidity than diesel fuel (B0) due to its characteristics, thus having a different effect on the lubricant side, particularly in the long term. This effect takes the form of an increase in the concentration of metal pollutants, both from friction and corrosion, leading to a decrease in the efficiency of the system. The study shows that Fe, Al, and Cr concentrations on lubricants containing B100 were lower, whereas Cu and Pb metals were higher than those with B20. The results show that the average concentrations of Fe, Al, and Cr metal contaminants in the B100 fuel oil were lower by 28%; 13.5%; and 42%, respectively, while the Cu and Pb metals in lubricants with B100 fuel were 23% and 19% higher, respectively, compared to lubricants with B20 fuels. Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) data shows that in the region of wave numbers 2850 cm−1 to 3000 cm−1, the strong absorption band occurred by showing the-CH group, which comes from the-CH2 and-CH3 groups and is mostly owned by hydrocarbon components. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study evaluated the economic feasibility of fast pyrolysis biorefineries fed with blended pine residues and switchgrass in the Southeastern U.S. with different supply chain design. Previous techno-economic analyses (TEA) have focused on either blended biomass or decentralized preprocessing without investigating the impacts of varied process parameters, technology options, and real-world biomass distribution. This study fills the literature gap by modeling scenarios for different biomass blending ratios, biorefinery and preprocessing site (so-called depot) capacities, and alternative preprocessing technologies. High-resolution, real-world geospatial data were analyzed using Geographic Information Systems to facilitate supply chain design and TEA. For a decentralized system, the minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) of biofuel was $3.92–$4.33 per gallon gasoline equivalent (GGE), while the MFSP for the centralized biorefinery at the same capacities ranged between $3.75–$4.02/GGE. Implementing a high moisture pelleting process depot rather than a conventional pelleting process lowered the MFSP by $0.03–$0.17/GGE. Scenario analysis indicated decreased MFSP with increasing biorefinery capacities but not necessarily with increasing depot size. Medium-size depots (500 OMDT/day) achieved the lowest MFSP. This analysis identified the optimal blending ratios for two preprocessing technologies at varied depot sizes. Counterintuitively, increasing the proportion of higher cost switchgrass reduced the MFSP for large biorefineries (>5000 ODMT/day), but increased the MFSP for small biorefineries (1000–2500 ODMT/day). Although the decentralized systems have a higher MFSP based on current analysis, it has other potential benefits such as mitigated supply chain risks and improved feedstock quality that are difficult to be quantified in this TEA. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A combination of biodiesel with hydroxy is expected to be one of the most viable fuels to enhance engine performance besides stringent emission norms. In this study, biodiesel was produced from water hyacinth and injected into the engine along with HHO in a volumetric ratio of 40% (BD40). The test was performed in a 4-stroke cycle, single cylinder, and water cool CI engine to evaluate performance, emission, combustion, and heat loss characteristics. The maximum biodiesel yield of 87% was obtained at 1% KOH, 9:1 M ratio, 500 rpm, and 55 °C for 90 min. The engine results showed that a mixture of hydroxy and biodiesel blends caused an increment of BTE by 12.4% while reducing BSEC by 13.5%, HC by 48% and CO by 21.9% as compared to DF. However, the induction of hydroxy increased NOx emission by 47.3% at full operational mode. The peak HHR, peak cylinder pressure, and ID were higher for hydroxy operated engine. The supplementation of hydroxy increased heat loss through the cooling water, and the exhaust. Thus, the present investigation has proved that the induction of hydroxy with BD40 in the CI engine improves performance and reduces exhaust emission like CO and HC except for NOx. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Particulate matter (PM) generated by residential wood combustion is a major environmental concern in Europe. This study focuses on the influence of potassium chloride (KCl) on fine particle emissions from a modern wood stove. Wood logs with and without KCl impregnation were subjected to batch combustion and emission measurements. A bi-modal particle number-size distribution characterized by a nucleation mode and an accumulation mode was identified for all types of wood fuel. However, in the presence of KCl, a lower number emission of ultrafine particles and a higher number emission of larger particles (size ∼200–500 nm) were observed. In addition, the emission factor of condensed organic compounds (COC) increased with increasing KCl content, from 0.16 g/kg dry wood for normal wood (NW) to 0.48 g/kg dry wood for wood impregnated with the 2 mol/L KCl solution (HKW), most likely due to the facilitated heterogeneous condensation of semi-volatile hydrocarbons on pre-existing ash particles. In addition, the emission factor of soot particles also increased slightly when the KCl content was high, from 1.47 g/kg dry wood for NW to 2.23 g/kg dry wood for HKW. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bio-based isobutanol has attracted more and more attention due to its wide application and excellent fuel performance. Compared with ethanol, isobutanol has higher energy density, lower oxygen content, and hygroscopicity, making it an ideal gasoline additive or substitute. Bio-based isobutanol has been commercially produced from a variety of renewable feedstock, including corn, wheat, sorghum, barley, and sugar cane by using a yeast biocatalyst. The existing facility of ethanol plants is acquired to separate and purify isobutanol from the fermentation broth, meaning that the energy-intensive distillation process still cannot be replaced. There are still some challenges in the production of bio-based isobutanol, such as low product concentration, unexpected impurities, high separation cost, thus the development of an efficient and low-cost downstream separation process has become one of the keys to the industrial production of bio-based isobutanol. The separation methods for isobutanol recovery, including vacuum evaporation, adsorption, pervaporation, gas stripping, solvent extraction, salting-out, salting-out extraction, are summarized in this review. An outlook on the challenges and opportunities of isobutanol separation is also described in this review. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Given the economic and environmental advantages of using Waste Fried Oil (WFO) as a starting material, this investigation explores the conversion of WFO to Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME) via electrolysis for use in waste. In electrolysis, hydroxyl ions are generated from water in close proximity to the cathode. When hydroxyl ions react with methanol, they produce a species of nucleophilic methoxide which is the main actor in converting WFO into FAME. This study specifically investigates the effects of voltage, catalyst concentration, co solvent amount, rotation speed, and molar ratio of methanol to WFO in electrolytic transesterification converting WFO into FAME using graphite electrodes in the presence of a heterogeneous, catalytic zeolite–chitosan composite. With an alcohol to WFO molar ratio of 8:1, 1 wt% zeolite-chitosan composite concentration at 40 V in the presence of 2 wt% H2O of the whole solution at room temperature and stirrer rate of 400 rpm and reaction time of 30 min, a 96.5% yield of FAME was achieved. Characterization of physical and biodiesel fuel properties was performed using American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) methods. The biocomposite was characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), X–ray Diffraction (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET), Thermogravimetric analysis (TG), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X–ray spectrometry (EDX). Finally, the physical properties of FAME produced under optimal conditions were studied using Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS), FTIR, surface tension, and viscosity. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae based biofuel is dictated to a great extent by certain synergistic interactions between critical nutrients as well as the quality and quantity of light energy available. For latitude regions with high light irradiance for a greater part of year, it is important to optimize the proportions of critical nutrients for microalgae species to display a suitable metabolic profile and not loose advantage when total light energy input increases. In this study, the conjunct impact of light intensity using white LED, together with photoperiod and nutrients (nitrate, phosphate and glucose) depleted and replete conditions on energy storage metabolites and fuel characteristics of Scenedesmus sp. were investigated under a mixotrophic growth regime. Results show that Scenedesmus sp. could efficiently exploit even very intense light, for longer duration (216 μmolm−2s−1 at 16:8 light: dark photoperiod) in presence of 1.5 g/L of sodium nitrate, 0.04 g/L of di-sodium hydrogen phosphate and 5 g/L of glucose (G5N1.5P0.04) to produce a biomass of 1782.4 ± 56.8 μg/mL with a specific growth rate of 0.2 ± 0.007 day−1. High light intensity (216 μmolm−2s−1) and organic carbon at 16:8 light: dark photoperiod (L16:D8) led to increased synthesis of carbohydrate content in the absence of nitrate and phosphate (1924.8 ± 128.6 μg/mg at G5N0P0), increased TFA in the absence of nitrate (59.5 μg/mg at G5N0P0.04) and high lipid content (154.1 ± 7.7 μg/mg at G5N1.5P0.04) without obliterating growth. Certain vital properties that determine the biodiesel quality were computed and compared to the parallel parameters put forth by European and American biodiesel norms. These results stand to be a baseline for sustainable algal bio-refinery and create futuristic vistas for further evaluation of Scenedesmus sp. for bio-energy applications in countries like India having tropical climate with high solar incoming radiation for a greater part of the year. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Most edible plants used for biofuel production need agricultural lands with freshwater resources, leading to the land crisis in near future. Thus, the halophyte plants which can grow in highly saline lands and tolerate seawater salinity are considered recently. In this work, the production of surfactant-free microemulsion hybrid biofuels according to the extracted oil from two types of halophytic salicornia plants and employing different eco-friendly oxygenated ethanolotropes are investigated to replace fossil fuels. According to the results of low temperature phase behavior, salicornia oil shows good low temperature phase behavior and is quite suitable for biofuel formulation. The nanostructures of the produced biofuels are characterized by dynamic light scattering, small angle X-ray scattering and electrical conductivity. The mean droplet size of all samples were in the range of 0.99 to 22.62 nm which corresponds to the IUPAC standard. According to electrical conductivity results, a large region of ethanol in oil structure can be seen along dilution lines at different weight fractions of additive to salicornia oil which are in agreement with zeta potential and dynamic light scattering results. The presented technique leads to the production of new green biofuels considering the worldwide freshwater shortage. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Spray characteristics are among the most important factors affecting compression ignition (CI) engine performance and emission levels. Fuel flow visualisation and optical diagnostics have been widely employed as methods for investigating combustion processes in CI engines. Due to the increase in the number of renewable alternative fuels and more stringent legislation governing engine pollutant emissions, it is important to characterise the spray behaviour of these alternative fuels in CI engines under different operating conditions. This study reviews and summarises the practice of spray visualisation to determine macroscopic characteristics, such as spray tip penetration (S) and spray cone (θ); and microscopic characteristics such as spray droplet diameter and Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD). It also provides literature reviews: experimental efforts regarding optical techniques; spray operating conditions (injection pressure, ambient conditions, and injector geometry), fuel types (biodiesel and alcohol blends) and numerical studies regarding software usage, spray models and simulation cases results. Increasing fuel injection pressure (FIP) initiates combustion due to improved spray penetration length and atomisation, however SMD decreases with increasing FIP. Fuel properties and ambient temperatures have a significant impact on both spray penetration length of the liquid phase and, two-phase interaction between liquid and vapour. Velocity of spray droplets is impacted by ambient gas and aerodynamic and viscous properties because of their impact on spray breakup processes. The higher viscosity and higher surface tension of the biodiesel blend resulted in a reduction of the Weber number and injection velocity with a corresponding increase in droplet size and SMD. All alcohol blends improved the atomisation performance of biodiesel and diesel fuel because alcohol blends have low kinematic viscosity, boiling point and surface tension leading to improved atomisation and vaporisation rate. Piezo-driven injection system atomisation performance is better than that of the solenoid-driven injection because of its faster response time. Finally, simulation studies of spray visualisation revealed good agreement with the experimental investigation so simulation studies can save time and effort. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The environmental impact and the dependence upon fossil fuels in the aeronautical sector have promoted the demand for alternative and greener fuels. The implementation of alternative fuels is one of the main challenges for this sector in the near future. A possible short-term solution might be the blending of biofuels with jet fuel, which would allow for the use of greener fuels and a reduction in the greenhouse gases and pollutant emissions without significant changes in the existing fleets of the companies, with the purpose to develop a "drop-in"fuel. In this context, this work examines the combustion characteristics of single droplets of Jet A-1 (JF), hydroprocessed vegetable oil (NExBTL), and their mixtures in a drop-tube furnace (DTF). The objective of this work is to evaluate the influence of the mixture composition on the fuel characteristics. Droplets with diameters of 155 ± 5 μm, produced by a commercial droplet generator, were injected into the DTF, whose wall temperature and oxygen concentration were controlled. Experiments were conducted for three temperatures (900, 1000, and 1100 °C). The combustion of droplets was evaluated through the images obtained with a high-speed camera coupled with a high magnification lens and an edge detection algorithm. From the images allowed for the analysis of droplet combustion, data are reported for the temporal evolution of droplet sizes and burning rates. The results revealed that the mixtures followed the D2 law, except the mixture with 75% JF for a DTF wall temperature of 1100 °C. The 75% JF mixture did not follow the D2 law as a result of the occurrence of puffing and microexplosions, which enhanced the burning rates. Additionally, it was observed that the mixtures with a higher content of JF present brighter flames and higher burning rates. © 2021 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society.

AB  - Renewable Energy Sources (RES) have become increasingly desirable worldwide in the fight against global climate change. The sharp decrease in costs of especially wind and solar photovoltaics (PV) have created opportunities to move from dependency on conventional fossil fuel-based electricity production towards renewable energy sources. Renewables experience around 7% (in 2018) annual growth rate in the electricity production globally and the pace is expected to further increase in the near future. Cuba is no exception in this regard, the government has set an ambitious renewable energy target of 24% RES of electricity production by the year 2030. The article analyses renewable energy trajectories in Isla de la Juventud, Cuba, through different future energy scenarios utilizing EnergyPLAN tool. The goal is to identify the best fit and least cost options in transitioning towards 100% electric power systemin Isla de la Juventud, Cuba. The work is divided into analysis of (1) technical possibilities for five scenarios in the electricity production with a 40% increase of electricity consumption by 2030: Business As Usual (BAU 2030, with the current electric power system (EPS) setup), VISION 2030 (according to the Cuban government plan with 24% RES), Advanced Renewables (ARES, with 50% RES), High Renewables (HiRES, with 70% RES), and Fully Renewables (FullRES, with 100% RES based electricity system) scenarios and (2) defining least cost options for the five scenarios in Isla de la Juventud, Cuba. The results show that high penetration of renewables is technically possible even up to 100% RES although the best technological fit versus least cost options may not favor the 100% RES based systems with the current electric power system (EPS) setup. This is due to realities in access to resources, especially importation of state of the art technological equipment and biofuels, financial and investment resources, as well as the high costs of storage systems. The analysis shows the Cuban government vision of reaching 24% of RES in the electricity production by 2030 can be exceeded even up to 70% RES based systems with similar or even lower costs in the near future in Isla de la Juventud. However, overcoming critical challenges in the economic, political, and legal conditions are crucially important; how will the implementation of huge national capital investments and significant involvement of Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) actualize to support achievement of the Cuban government’s 2030 vision?. © 2021 by the author.

AB  - Plastics are one of the major pollutants to the environment. An investigation is carried out in converting low density polyethylene (LDPE) to oil by pyrolysis method with the aid of catalyst for the use in internal combustion engines. Experiments were conducted at different speeds (1200, 1500 and 1800 rpm) and variable loads (low, medium and full) with constant compression ratio engine to evaluate the performance and ecological parameters. Plastic pyrolyzed oil (PPO) is blended with diesel fuel in 20:80 volume proportion to get D80PO20 blended mixture which is employed in engine in order to assess its characteristics. Encouraging outcomes have been obtained as cylinder pressure in combustion is of same order as that of diesel fueled engine. The results showed that increasing engine speeds resulted in higher cylinder pressure and brake thermal efficiency. Also, high nitrogen oxide (NOX) and low brake specific energy consumption (BSFC) has been identified. Lower smoke (BSN) and NOX emissions are noticed from engine tail pipe with D80PO20 blended mixture. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The production and utilization of biofuels from food crops have been reviewed. Developments in Brazil, the United States, the European Union and China have been assessed in relation to the aims of biofuels policies, their costs and outcomes. The energy input for making biofuels has been compared with energy released during their combustion. The effect of using crops for fuel on the cost of grain for food and of arable land have been examined. There is evidence that current international policies have caused environmental degradation greater than the fossil fuels they were purported to replace. However, policy choices are difficult to reverse. Despite vast effort and expense, the actual scale of biofuels production is small compared to the resources that have been mobilized. As these processes have evolved, new groups of commercial interests have coalesced internationally, to take advantage of the subsidies with little recognizable benefit to the environment. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - The potential of new trimetallic (Ce, Cu, La) loaded montmorillonite clay catalyst for synthesizing biodiesel using novel non-edible Celastrus paniculatus Willd seed oil via two-step transesterification reaction has been reported along with catalyst characterization. Transesterification reaction was optimized and maximum biodiesel yield of 89.42% achieved under optimal operating reaction states like; 1:12 oil to methanol ratio, 3.5% of catalyst amount, 120 °C of reaction temperature for 3 h. The predicted and experimental biodiesel yields under these reaction conditions were 89.42 and 89.40%, which showing less than 0.05% variation. Additionally, optimum biodiesel yield can be predicted by drawing 3D surface plots and 2D contour plots using MINITAB 17 software. For the characterization of the obtained biodiesel, analysis including the GC/MS, FT-IR, 1H NMR and 13C NMR were applied. The fuel properties of obtained biodiesel agrees well with the different European Union (EU-14214), China (GB/T 20828), and American (ASTM-951, 6751) standards. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) activity of NiMo catalysts have been evaluated in the presence of catalyst poisons in bio-based feedstocks. An in-house synthesized NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst was placed in a refinery unit for biofuel production. Iron (Fe), phosphorus (P) and metals were identified as major contaminants. Calcination treatment was explored to recover the activity of spent catalysts. The effect of Fe, K and phospholipid containing P and Na on catalyst deactivation during hydrodeoxygenation of stearic acid was simulated at lab-scale. Fe caused the most deactivation where the highest feed concentration of the Fe compound resulted in 1480 ppm Fe deposited on the catalyst. Elemental distribution along the radial axis of spent catalysts indicated: Fe deposited only to a depth of 100 μm irrespective of concentration while P and Na from phospholipid and K penetrated deeper in catalyst particles with a distribution profile that was found to be concentration dependent. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, walnut shells and bio-oil distillation residues were co-pyrolyzed at varying ratios (i.e. 1:3, 1:1, and 3:1) and the resulting bio-oils were collected via fractional condensation. Furthermore, the effect of lyophilization on the collected bio-oils was analyzed. The results indicated that the temperature of fractional condensation effectively controlled the co-pyrolytic oil yield in first condenser, while the total bio-oil yield and condensation efficiency were dominated by the co-pyrolytic blend mass ratios. Meanwhile, the lower ratio of mixed walnut shell and higher condensation temperature would improve the element distribution of bio-oil, namely weakened oxygen content and intensified carbon content. Moreover, the introduction of bio-oil distillation residue not only decreased the content of carboxylic acids in co-pyrolytic oils, but also accelerated the conversion of lignin oligomers to aromatic monomers. The product distribution of fractional co-pyrolytic oil was also improved, in which the total detectable phenols enhanced to 9.73 wt% (with a maximum increase of 22.79 times). Additionally, lyophilization had a positive effect on separation and purification of aqueous bio-oil, endowing 4.79–10.81 times enhancement of detectable phenols and exhibiting a maximum increase of furfural content as surprising 2.22 wt%. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Single cell oils (SCO) are a promising source of oils that could be exploited in different industrial areas. SCO for biodiesel production circumvents the controversy food vs. fuel, does not require large land areas for culture, and is independent of climate and seasonal variations, among other advantages in comparison to vegetable oils. In this study, a red yeast isolated from a mountain water source, identified as Rhodotorula glutinis T13, showed high potential for lipid production (40% w/w) with suitable growth parameters, yields, and fatty acids profile. Yeast lipids showed a high content of unsaturated fatty acids (56.44%; C18:1, C18:2), and the fuel properties (cetane number, iodine value, density, kinematic viscosity, etc.) of yeast oil analysed were in good agreement with international biodiesel standards. The results show that R. glutinis T13 can be used in the future as a promising microorganism for the commercial production of biodiesel. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Effective catalysts are indispensable for the preparation of fuel components from vegetable oils via the one-step hydrothermal method. In this study, the Pt/MCM-41 catalysts were prepared by etching with sulfuric acid, citric acid, or hydrochloric acid. The performance of the obtained Pt/MCM-41 catalysts for the hydrothermal treatment of vegetable oils was evaluated in a fixed-bed reactor using Jatropha oil as a model raw material (temperature = 360°C, liquid hourly space velocity = 1 h−1, hydrogen–oil ratio = 1000, and hydrogen pressure = 4 MPa). The modified catalysts were characterized using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller analysis, X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, temperature-programmed desorption of NH3, CO chemisorption, and pyridine adsorption infrared spectroscopy, respectively. Furthermore, the selectivity of various fuel components, including C8–C16 alkanes, C8–C16 iso-alkanes, C8–C16 arenes, and C17–C18 alkanes, were analyzed based on the catalyst characteristics. Acid etching was found to decrease the surface area of Al-MCM-41 but increase the amount of acid sites, and among these acids, citric acid was proved as the priority additives, with better catalytic performance. Moreover, this catalyst exhibited the best conversion and the highest C8–C16 and C17–C18 selectivities. © 2020 The Authors. GCB Bioenergy Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - In the present work, biofuels produced from different raw fatty materials have been proposed as a dominant fuel component in biodiesel-diesel fuel blends. Biofuels were produced from pork lard and rapeseed oil by alkali transesterification using methyl alcohol. Blends of biofuels in volumetric proportions of 60 and 80% of the biocomponent and the remaining part of the conventional fuel were used in a compression ignition engine designed for medium-duty vehicles. The experiments were conducted at two engine rotational speeds (1500 and 3000 rpm, respectively) and a set of load conditions (50, 100, and 200 Nm, respectively). The tests focused on engine efficiency parameters (brake-specific fuel consumption and brake fuel conversion efficiency) as well as exhaust gas emissions (hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide were determined). The obtained results indicate that blends containing biocomponents produced from pork lard were characterized by superior fuel consumption and efficiency results, compared to blends containing biocomponents produced from rapeseed oil. In terms of exhaust emissions, biocomponents produced from pork lard were also characterized by lower emission of all of the examined components compared to rapeseed methyl ester-diesel blends. This study proposes that fuel components obtained from custom (animal) raw-fatty material can be an effective substitute for commonly used rapeseed oil methyl esters. © 2021 Silesian University of Technology.

AB  - γ-Valerolactone (GVL), which can be generated from levulinic acid (LA), has attained a humongous amount of interest due to its implantation in various fields, which includes fuels and fuel additives. Herein, for the first time, we have sequentially synthesized silver-cobalt core-shell nanoalloy-based catalysts through a simple wet impregnation method for selective conversion of LA to GVL. The highest catalytic proficiency (97.3 LA conversion with 100% GVL selectivity) had been achieved over a composition-graded optimized catalyst, named 5Ag-15Co, under comparatively moderate reaction conditions (150 °C, 1 MPa H2 pressure). The catalyst structure-activity relationship has been established through an extensive range of in situ spectroscopic characterizations, which included in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), in situ CO-diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy, and in situ attenuated total reflection-inferred (ATR-IR) spectroscopy. The extraordinary catalytic activity could be attributed to the modulation of electronic properties, which is mainly due to the synergistic interaction in the core-shell alloy system, as confirmed from in situ XPS studies. The presence of the highest amount of metallic cobalt in the 5Ag-15Co catalyst, which was evidenced by both in situ XPS and in situ CO-DRIFT, could assist the hydrogenation step in hydrodeoxygenation of LA to GVL. This finding also was emphasized by H2 chemisorption analysis, which revealed the presence of the highest active metal surface area in the 5Ag-15Co catalyst. In situ ATR-IR has elucidated that moderate interaction, which was generated between the catalyst and LA, has enhanced the rate of reaction. This finding also has been emphasized by the results obtained from NH3-TPD analysis, which revealed that the presence of high surface density of Lewis/weak acidic sites facilitated the hydrogenation step in the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reaction. The detailed kinetic analysis revealed that the 5Ag-15Co catalyst had the lowest activation energy (41.34 kJ) among its counterparts, which accelerated the reaction rate. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Given the scarceness of fossil fuels and high volume of pollution caused through the consumption of these fuels, many efforts are being made to produce alternative fuels. Biodiesel is one of the alternatives to diesel fuels. The main problem with biodiesel production is higher operation costs, as compared with diesel fuels. In this study, waste cooking oil and cow bone as the catalyst were used to reduce feed costs as much as possible. Moreover, a microreactor was utilized to reduce the residence time to 1 min. Using Box-Behnken design method, the effect of different variables including catalyst concentration (calcined cow bone), oil to methanol volume ratio, residence time, and reaction temperature on the purity of produced biodiesel were examined. The results showed that when using a catalyst concentration of 8.5 wt %, an oil to methanol volume ratio of 2.25 vol: vol, a residence time of 60 s, and a temperature of 63.1 °C, the maximum purity of biodiesel was 99.24%. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Glycerol availabity, a waste generated in the production of biodiesel, has increased during last years. In this work, Chemical Looping Reforming (CLR) of glycerol has been demonstrated in a 1 kWth continuous unit during 35 h using a Ni-based oxygen carrier to obtain a high purity syngas without CO2 emissions. Complete conversion of the glycerol and syngas composition close to thermodynamic equilibrium was obtained in the fuel reactor. Moreover, pure N2 was obtained as product in the air reactor. The influence of the main operating variables on the composition and flow rates of synthesis gas was evaluated. The oxygen-to-glycerol molar ratio was the main parameter since the amount of lattice oxygen transferred by the oxygen carrier in the fuel reactor controlled the syngas composition. The increase of the water-to-glycerol ratio produced an increase in the production of H2 and CO2 with a decrease in the CO content, increasing both the syngas yield and the H2/CO molar ratio in the gas. Fuel reactor temperature affected mainly to the CH4 content, being lower as higher was the temperature. Close to autothermal conditions, it is possible to obtain a syngas composed by H2 ≈ 48–50 vol%; CO ≈ 30–35 vol%; CO2 ≈ 14–18 vol%; and CH4 ≈ 1.6–3 vol%. In addition, different H2/CO ratios can be obtained by modifying the H2O/glycerol ratio and temperature. A H2/CO ratio of 2 could be reached using either a H2O/glycerol ratio of 1.5 at 750 °C or a H2O/glycerol ratio of 2 at 800 °C. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pediatric asthma incidence has been associated with exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in ambient air. NO2 is predominantly emitted through fossil fuel use in land transportation, power generation and the burning of solid biofuels in households. We simulated NO2 with a global atmospheric chemistry model, combined with a land use regression model, to estimate NO2 exposure in all countries worldwide. The global asthma incidence among children and adolescents attributable to NO2 was estimated by deriving an exposure-response function from a meta-analysis which included epidemiological studies from multiple countries, baseline incidence rates from the Global Burden of Disease and gridded population data. The sectoral contribution to pediatric asthma from NO2 exposure (NO2-related asthma incidence: NINC) was estimated for different source categories to provide guidance to mitigation policies. We estimate 3.52 (2.1-6.0) million NINC per year globally, being about 14% of the total asthma incidence cases among children and adolescents. We find that emissions from land transportation are the leading contributor to NINC globally (∼44%), followed by the domestic burning of solid fuels (∼10.3%) and power generation from fossil fuels (∼8.7%). Biogenic emissions which are not anthropogenically induced may contribute ∼14% to the total NINC. Our results show large regional differences in source contributions, as the domestic burning of solid fuels is a main contributor to NINC in India and Nepal (∼25%), while emissions from shipping are the leading source in Scandinavian countries (∼40%), for example. While only 5% of all children and adolescents live in areas where NO2 exceeds the WHO annual guideline of 21.25 ppb (40 μg m-3) for NO2, about 90% of the NINC is found in regions that meet the WHO guideline, related to the uneven distribution of children and adolescents in the population. This suggests the need for stricter policies to reduce NO2 exposure, and revisiting the current WHO guideline to reduce the health risks of children and adolescents. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Microbial fuel cell (MFC) efficiency depends on charge transfer capability from microbe to anode, and the application of suitable redox mediators is important in this area. In this study, yeast viability experiments were performed to determine the 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (mena-dione (MD)) influence on different yeast cell species (baker’s yeast and Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cells). In addition, electrochemical measurements to investigate MFC performance and efficiency were carried out. This research revealed that baker’s yeast cells were more resistant to dissolved MD, but the current density decreased when yeast solution concentration was incrementally in-creased in the same cell. The maximal calculated power of a designed baker’s yeast-based MFC cell anode was 0.408 mW/m2 and this power output was registered at 24 mV. Simultaneously, the cell generated a 62-mV open circuit potential in the presence of 23 mM potassium ferricyanide and the absence of glucose and immobilized MD. The results only confirm that MD has strong potential to be applied to microbial fuel cells and that a two-redox-mediator-based system is suitable for application in microbial fuel cells. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Crude glycerol, a by-product of biodiesel industry, has been used for production of biodiesel and polyhydroxy-alkanoates. But question is: which product is economically favorable using crude glycerol as substrate? In this study, energy balance and economic assessment has been carried out for crude glycerol valorization for B10 biodiesel and polyhydroxy-butyrate (PHB) production. For same quantity of crude glycerol utilized, energy ratio for B10 production was higher than PHB production while unit production cost for B10 was lower than that of PHB. For 50 million L plant capacity of biodiesel, unit production cost was 0.77 $/L B10 while for 2 million kg plant capacity of PHB, unit production cost was 4.88 $/kg PHB. Thus, in present scenario production of biodiesel seems economically better than production of PHA with crude glycerol as raw material. This study is useful for researchers, environmental scientists and industries in identifying effective route for crude glycerol valorization. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel production using microbial oil derived from food waste discarded by the hospilatity sector could provide a sustainable replacement for diesel fuel. Discarded potato peels were used in solid-state fermentations of Aspergillus awamori for the production of glucoamylase (30 U/g) and protease (50 U/g). Hospitality food waste hydrolysis led to 98% (w/w) starch to glucose conversion yields. Crude hydrolyzates were used in shake flask fermentations with the oleaginous yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides Y-27012 leading to 32.9 g/L total dry weight (TDW) with 36.4% (w/w) intracellular lipid content. Fed-bath bioreactor cultures resulted in TDW of 53.9 g/L and lipid concentration of 26.7 g/L. Principal component analysis showed a fatty acid profile similar to soybean oil and solid food waste oil. Microbial oil was transesterified into biodiesel with satisfactory performance considering the European standard EN 14214. This work demonstrated that valorization of food waste for biodiesel production is feasible. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The use of diesel fuel in crop and transportation operations is responsible for one third of the carbon emissions in sugarcane biorefineries. A possible solution is to replace it with biodiesel from lipids, directly produced from sugarcane by highly productive heterotrophic microalgae. In this study a heterotrophic microalgae biodiesel plant, integrated with a typical Brazilian sugarcane bio-refinery, was designed and evaluated. Molasses, steam, and electricity from sugarcane processing were used as inputs for microalgae production. For a non-integrated plant, the production cost of the microalgae biodiesel was estimated at 2.51 and 2.27 $/liter for fed-batch and continuous processes, respectively. Equipment for cultivation and carbon sources was the highest cost affecting the financial feasibility of the proposed design. For the integrated plant, at present ethanol and biodiesel selling prices, the profitability would be lower than a first-generation sugarcane bio-refinery using fossil diesel fuel for its operations. However, the CO2 emissions would be reduced by up to 50 000 × 103 kg per year at a cost of $83 10−3 kg−1 CO2-eq. If carbon credits are considered, the process becomes economically profitable even at present fuel prices. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - As China continues to focus on renewable energy in its future development, the energy performance of biofuels has become a hot research topic. However, existing bioenergy assessments have used diverse indexes and inconsistent system boundaries, hindering the comparative analysis of different technologies. Generally, improvements in energy quality (e.g., from solid to gaseous fuel) are accompanied by increases in nonrenewable energy investment. To quantify this trade-off, this study examined the energy return on investment (EROI) of typical biomass conversion systems in China—namely, biomass compression, biodiesel, bioethanol, biogas, biomass gasification, and biomass power generation. Various feedstocks were considered, including first-generation (e.g., corn), second-generation (e.g., corn straw), and third-generation (e.g., algae) feedstock options. The system boundaries of previous biomass footprint calculations are unified to make the results comparable. The results showed that converting raw biomass feedstock to solid fuel had the highest EROI (8.06-24.13), followed by biomass power (2.07-16.48), biogas (1.24-11.05), biodiesel (1.28-2.23), second-generation bioethanol (1.18-9.90), first-generation bioethanol (0.68-3.12), and biomass gasification (1.12-1.57). Compared with fossil fuels (e.g., gasoline, diesel), biofuels had a higher average EROI, indicating obvious energy-saving benefits. Among all biomass conversion pathways, pyrolysis gasification had the highest EROI opportunity cost for both straw and wood residues. This study's findings highlight the need for consistent system boundaries in bioenergy technology deployment to quantify the EROI opportunity cost of each biomass conversion pathway, and recognize the importance of energy efficiency promotion to enhance the economic feasibility of biomass energy industries. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In general, the certified pathways for the production of sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) are still far from being competitive with fossil kerosene, although they have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, the mitigation costs related to SAFs and how they compete with the carbon credits market remain unclear. The present study addressed these issues, evaluating SAF pathways based on hydrotreatment (HEFA process) of soybean oil, palm oil, used cooking oil (UCO) and beef tallow; dehydration and oligomerization of ethanol (ATJ technology) obtained from sugarcane, lignocellulosic residues, and steel off-gases; and the thermochemical conversion of lignocellulosic residues using the Fischer–Tropsch (FT) process and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). Residue-based pathways had lower mitigation costs. Used cooking oil / HEFA had the lowest value (185 USD tCO2e−1), followed by the thermochemical conversion of forestry residues (234–263 USD tCO2e−1). Of the 1G pathways, SAF production from 1G sugarcane ethanol (SC-1G/ATJ) performed better (495 USD tCO2e−1) than oil-based ones. In comparison with the carbon market, the mitigation costs of SAFs are much higher than the current prices or even future ones. However, several concerns about the credibility of the emission units and their effective mitigation effects indicate that SAFs could play an important role in aviation sector goals. Considering the potential of supplying SAF and mitigating emissions, SC-1G/ATJ was suggested as a preferred alternative in the short term. Of the residue-based pathways, tallow / HEFA and FT of forestry residues are suggested as strategic alternatives. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - In line with the aim to minimize climate change and dependence on fossil fuels, there is an increasing demand from different transport sectors for non-oxygenated and low-cost biofuels. In this study, bio-hydrocarbons were synthesized from macauba oils, which is a new and promising biofuel feedstock. These fatty materials were subjected to deoxygenation reactions over beta zeolite and ZSM-5 catalysts with different acidities (Si/Al ratio). Other parameters such as the reaction atmosphere (N2 or H2), catalyst calcination time, feedstock composition, and reaction time were also investigated. A preliminary study of the deoxygenation reaction kinetics indicated a higher conversion rate of hydrocarbons using beta zeolite, achieving a conversion of 100% in 3 h. The products were categorized into different compounds classes, such as linear, cyclic, branched, and aromatic hydrocarbons. The longer calcination time of the non-noble metal catalyst (15 h) and the use of hydrogen resulted in a high degree of deoxygenation. A higher percentage of hydrocarbons was obtained using an already hydrolyzed macauba pulp oil, with high initial acidity (38% m/m), and 10 bar H2. This feedstock and the innovative process provide low-cost alternatives to produce drop-in biofuels on a large scale. © 2020

AB  - The present research work was conducted on a compression ignition engine to assess the engine characteristics fueled with the blend of diesel and high-oxygenated additives such as ethanol. Ethanol does not easily blend with diesel. In order to attain a homogeneous mixture, a small amount of additive is added to the blend. Different additives were added to the blend to form a homogeneous mixture. Stability test was conducted on the blend to ensure prolonged homogeneity. The additives used for the test purpose were isopropanol, oleic acid, and ethylene acetate. From the stability results, it was found that oleic acid was the best additive which produces a better homogenous mixture for the blend of ethanol and diesel. One percentage of oleic acid is used as an additive to blend ethanol and diesel. The different combinations of blend ratios used for the test purpose were D90E10, D80E20, and D70E30. All the aforementioned blends have low cetane number because of ethanol, which was compensated by adding 1% DEE (diethyl ether) to all the blends. Experimental results exhibit that there is an improvement in the performance characteristics, such as brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and specific energy consumption (SEC), with the enrichment of DEE in ethanol-diesel blend. It is also noticed that the blend without DEE exhibited lower magnitude. This is mainly due to higher energy content and cetane number of DEE. Emission characteristics, like hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO), were found to drastically increase with the increase in the ethanol concentration in the diesel blend. This is attributed to higher latent heat of vaporization (LHV) of ethanol present in the blend. Combustion pressure and heat release rate of the DEE-enriched ethanol blends were higher by 2.2 % and 2.4 %, respectively, when compared with their corresponding blends without DEE. This is a result of higher volatility of DEE which leads to better combustion. [Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Use of biodiesel in diesel engine helps to reduce HC, CO, and smoke emissions due to their enormous oxygen content, whereas NOx emissions formed by Zeldovich mechanism shoot up. Implementation of Bharat Stage (BS) VI by April 2020 in India has created extreme pressure on automobile manufacturers to include after treatment technology in their systems. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR), a NOx control technology, is operated using aqueous urea solution as the reductant. There are several parameters that need to be monitored to enhance the NOx conversion efficiency of SCR retrofit. The uniformity index of ammonia, which determines the conversion efficiency, is greatly influenced by parameters like exhaust gas temperature, injection angle, injector position, mass flow rate, and SCR geometry. This paper considers two types of SCR design, namely SCR with and without mixer design and their impact on NOx reduction. The effect of mass flow rate on urea conversion in SCR design without mixer is 27%, but the impact is reduced greatly in SCR design with mixer with less than 2% variation. The UI resulting from different cases ranges from 0.59 to 0.83. Using Taguchi technique and CFD tool, the impact of parameters on both the SCR designs has been investigated and the optimum SCR design is reported. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The utilization of plastic in day to day life is ever-increasing and has generated a large amount of plastic garbage that needs proper disposal to save the environment from harmful pollution. The plastic waste management becomes a pressing concern in the present scenario in developing countries like India. This research article evaluates the potential of synthetic fuel (SF) derived from waste plastics collected from the local shops. In this current investigation, the SF blends are tested in a direct injection diesel engine to analyze the performance and emission characteristics of the engine. Three different blends were made namely SF20, SF40, and SF60 on a volumetric basis and the tests were carried out. From the experimental results, it was found that brake thermal efficiency (BTE) of the fuel blends was reduced as compared with neat diesel operation regardless of loads whereas SF20 showed a similar trend as that of diesel operation. The analysis of the emission characteristics revealed that the SF20 blends reduced dangerous smoke and carbon monoxide emission as compared with other test fuels. From the overall results, SF20 showed superior performance and emission aspects as compared with other SF blends whereas the engine operated smoothly up to 60% of SF blending at all loading conditions. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The current research work focuses mainly on improving the performance and emission characteristics of nanoparticle-blended mahua oil-fueled diesel engine. This work concentrates on finding the optimum quantity of nanoparticles to be blended with mahua oil so that it can be effectively deployed in compression ignition (CI) engine. A 4-stroke diesel engine with 3.7 kW at 1500 rpm was employed in this research. The two nanoparticles, Al2O3 and TiO2, were used in this experiment to blend with mahua oil. The nanoparticles of different concentrations, such as 25, 50, 75, and 100 ppm, were blended with mahua oil to test the performance. Based on the stability, the optimum blend was chosen. The mahua oil was emulsified in order to further enhance the optimum performance of the nanoparticle-blended mahua oil. The nanoparticles act as a combustion enhancer and aggravate the combustion process. The nanoparticle-blended emulsified mahua oil showed better performance and reduced emissions. The brake thermal efficiency (BTE) values of 100 ppm Al2O3 and TiO2 blended emulsified mahua oil (EMO) were 29.2% and 28.4% respectively, while in case of diesel and mahua oil, the values were 31.4% and 23.8% respectively. The smoke value for EMO with 100 ppm Al2O3 and TiO2 was found to have decreased by 61.9% and 59.4% respectively compared with mahua oil. The hydrocarbon (HC) emissions for EMO with 100 ppm Al2O3 and TiO2 were found to have decreased by 37.3% and 32.96% respectively. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Biofuel is the only novel solution to the increase in the greenhouse effect and bursting energy demand. The catalytic cracking of non-edible vegetable oils, namely castor and mustard was studied to yield gasoline range (C5–C9) hydrocarbons. Hβ (Microporous; pore size &lt;2 nm) and AlMCM-41 (Mesoporous; pore size 2 nm–50 nm) materials with different Si/Al ratios were used as catalysts for cracking purposes. Characterization of these catalysts was done by X-ray diffraction, Surface area analyzer, nitrogen sorption studies, TPD and inductively coupled plasma techniques. Used mustard oil was cracked over AlMCM-41 catalysts in a fixed bed catalytic cracking unit at optimized reaction condition (400 °C, 4.6 h−1) obtained over Hβ. The liquid and gaseous products were analyzed using gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-9A). Among the mesoporous catalysts AlMCM-41 (27) was able to convert 75% of mustard oil into 48% of bioliquid and 30.4% selectivity towards BG. Pongamia, neem, castor, fresh coconut and used coconut oil was also cracked using AlMCM-41 (27) catalyst. The major products of cracking reactions were Castor Bioliquid (CBL) comprising of bio gasoline (BG), bio kerosene (BK) and bio diesel (BD) with less yield of gaseous products. AlMCM-41 converted 98% of castor oil into 85% of CBL and it was tested with ASTM 6751 standard procedures for its calorific value, viscosity and flash point. The sulphur emission from CBL run engine reached lower index. The results exhibited the commercial utility of the CBL in the near future. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Supercritical water gasification (SCWG) as a pathway for biofuel production, presents an attractive option for processing assorted biomass feedstock due to its ability to process wet feedstock with higher hydrogen yield. However, SCWG requires significant thermal energy input to reach its high operating temperatures leading to overall process inefficiency. Although previous studies have found microalgae-based SCWG process to be uneconomic, investigations on the choice of energy integration and process-energy configuration options to make the process economically viable has not been considered. As such, this work focused on the economic viability of integrating energy alternatives such as solar thermal options (solar tower and parabolic trough collector), natural gas (NG), and electricity in a microalgae-based SCWG fuel plant. The syngas fuel plant of 19,000 t/y was modelled in Aspen Plus using nine different energy configurations of solar and conventional energy. The economic results of the energy integrations delivered minimum fuel selling prices (MFSPs) of 52–73 AUD/GJ. The most economic options for supplying energy to the plant were shown to be NG alone or using solar parabolic trough combined with supplementary NG to further boost the feedstock temperature in the SCWG reactor. The annual variable operational cost was found to contribute 77% towards MFSP and was highly dependent on the price of microalgae and hydrogen. At higher capital cost, MFSP was affected by the discount rate and the cost of energy which are susceptible to the cost of solar energy infrastructure or price of conventional energy. Sensitivity and switch value analysis showed that natural gas and parabolic trough-natural gas energy integrations could deliver lower MFSP at considerable reductions in annual operational cost and the solar energy components of the annual capital cost. The choice of energy option and process-energy configuration was demonstrated to play a significant role in making SCWG process economical. While solar tower technology may not be viable for high temperature process plant energy utilization, combining solar parabolic trough with natural gas was determined to be a more promising outcome for lower energy cost. Higher prices of conventional energy, carbon tax credit and government policies could make the SCWG technology with algae feedstock economically viable and 100% renewable in the future. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - 4-Hydroxybenzoic acid (HBA) is commonly found at high concentrations in waste streams generated by the thermochemical conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to bio-oils and biofuels. The objective of this study was to systematically assess the biotransformation of HBA in the bioanode of a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) for the production of renewable cathodic H2. A mixed, denitrifying culture, enriched with HBA as the sole electron donor, was used as the anode inoculum. MEC electrochemical performance, H2 yield, HBA biotransformation pathways and products, and the bioanode suspended and biofilm microbial communities were examined. In the absence of nitrate, 60%-100% HBA was converted to phenol, which persisted, resulting in very limited exoelectrogenesis. Under nitrate-reducing conditions, complete HBA degradation was achieved in the MEC bioanode with very low phenol production, resulting in the production of cathodic H2. The predominant bacterial genus in the MEC bioanode (relative abundance 33.4%-41.9%) was the denitrifier Magnetospirillum, which uses the benzoyl-CoA pathway to degrade aromatic compounds. Geobacter accounted for 5.9-7.8% of the MEC bioanode community. Thus, active nitrate reduction in the MEC bioanode led to complete HBA degradation, resulting in a higher extent of exoelectrogenesis and cathodic H2 production. The results of this study provide mechanistic insights into a productive use of HBA and other phenolic compounds typically found in waste streams resulting from the thermochemical conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to biofuels. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Purpose: Coffee cut-stems (CCS) are typically left in the field after coffee harvesting as fertilizer or used partially for cooking and drying of coffee grains. However, the energy contained in this residue is not completely exploited. For this reason, different applications for CCS have been considered to obtain innovative products. This work aims to evaluate the environmental impact of energy generation through two biorefinery systems using CCS as feedstock. Methods: The life cycle assessment (LCA) considers a cradle-to-gate approach, beginning at the seed germination and ending at the production of ethanol, electricity, and low-pressure steam. Inventory data of the coffee production are collected from national reports. Mass and energy balances are calculated using an integrated methodological approach comprising the conceptual design and optimization of the CCS biorefineries. Results and discussion: CCS production is one of the hotspots in both evaluated biorefineries due to the use of high amounts of fertilizers, contributing to most of the environmental impact categories. From the two assessed biorefinery configurations, the system with the lowest environmental benefits was the one that considered the generation of electricity and steam. Factors such as the high emissions of exhaust gases (mainly composed of CO2) and the use of water for steam generation were the main contributors. The alternative solution I (AS-I) has the lowest environmental impact in comparison with the base case. From the sensitivity analyses, the use of energy allocation approach provided better performance than the system expansion approach. However, the selection of one approach over the other highly depends on the evaluated impact category based on the uncertainty analysis. Conclusions: The production of CCS has the highest contribution to the overall environmental impact of the evaluated biorefineries, and thus, we need available information of the coffee crop production including the production of co-products, such as CCS. We present a detailed inventory of the production of CCS in Colombia as an important contribution for further research in the area of coffee-based biorefineries. Based on our inventory, the production of bioenergy (electricity and steam) for a coffee-based biorefinery seems to provide the best environmental performance in comparison to the production of biofuels (ethanol). © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Post-harvest crop residue burning is extensively practiced in North India, which results in enhanced particulate matter (PM) concentrations. This study explores the PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 μm) emissions during various time periods (pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon) over the biomass burning source region in Beas, Punjab. The PM2.5 concentrations during the pre-monsoon period (106–458 μg m−3) and the post-monsoon period (184–342 μg m−3) were similar but much higher than concentrations during the monsoon season (23–95 μg m−3) due to enhanced wet deposition. However, the carbonaceous aerosol fraction in PM2.5 was nearly double in the post-monsoon season (∼27%) than the pre-monsoon period (∼15%). A higher contribution of secondary organic carbon (SOC) observed during the pre-monsoon season can be attributed to enhanced photochemical activity in dry conditions. Stable carbon isotope ratio (δ13C value) of ambient PM allowed elucidation of contributing sources. δ13CTC correlation with SOC during post-monsoon and pre-monsoon periods suggests significant influence of secondary formation processes during both time periods. The concentrations of carbon fractions in sampled sources and aerosols suggests contribution of biofuels, resulting in enhanced PM concentration at this location. δ13CTC values of pre- and post-monsoon samples show dominance of freshly emitted aerosols from local sources. Impact of biomass and biofuel combustion was also confirmed by biomass burning K+BB tracer, indicating that major agriculture residue burning occurred primarily during nighttime. C3 plant derived aerosols dominated at the sampling location during the entire sampling duration and contributed significantly during the pre-monsoon season. Whereas, both fossil fuel and C3 plant combustion contributed to the total mass of carbonaceous aerosols during the post-monsoon and monsoon seasons. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The coconut fatty acid distillate (CFAD) was used as a novel feedstock for biodiesel production in this investigation. Its characterization as fuel in diesel engine was also studied. A maximum biodiesel yield of 92.6% was obtained, when esterification is performed with 10:1 methanol to oil ratio, 2.5% sulphuric acid at 60 °C for 90 min. This is followed by transesterification with optimized parameters of methanol to oil ratio 8:1, 1.5% potassium hydroxide at 60 °C for 90 min. 20%, 40%, 60% and 100% of CFAD biodiesel (CFAB) was added to diesel to form blends CFAB20, CFAB40, CFAB60 and CFAB100. Engine test results showed that the performance of CFAB20 is closer to diesel than the other CFAB blends. The brake thermal efficiency (BTE) of CFAB20 was found to be 4.7% lesser than diesel. Nitrogen oxide emission is higher for all biodiesel blends due to enhanced combustion characteristics. However, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon and smoke were reduced by 50%, 36.6% and 42.9% respectively for CFAB100 when compared to diesel at full load. Thus it is inferred that the CFAD is a potential source for biodiesel production. CFAB20 can be used in diesel engines with acceptable BTE and reduced emissions without any engine modification. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Present investigation highlighted the capability of microalgae cultivation in sewage wastewater integrated with nanomaterial, addressing wastewater treatment and consequent improvement in lipid for biodiesel application. Herein, the isolated microalga Chlorosarcinopsis sp. MAS04, was cultured in primary treated wastewater (PTWW) and secondary treated wastewater (STWW) incorporated with Zinc Oxide nanoparticles (ZnO- NPs). The characterizations of ZnO-NPs were performed by analytical technique and cytotoxicity assay of microalga against nanoparticles (NPs) was carried out prior to the experiment. The nutrient reduction rate of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total Nitrogen (TN), Total Phosphorous (TP), and Total Organic Carbon (TOC) by microalga was found higher in PTWW as compared to the STWW when incorporated with the ZnO-NPs. Maximum biomass of 3.43 g/L and 2.14 g/L along with 1.9 and 1.5 folds increase in cellular lipid was recorded in the presence of PTWW and STWW respectively as compared to control (BG-11). The cellular lipids were converted to fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) by the process of transesterification and analyzed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS). The cells developed in PTWW and STWW incorporated with ZnO-NPs were recorded with a higher amount of saturated fatty acids (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) with controlled polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Biofuel properties were found in accordance with American and European guidelines. The present report suggested that the Chlorosarcinopsis sp. MAS04 -ZnO NPs association is capable of better nutrient removal from sewage wastewater. Therefore, the nano-bio hybrid opens a new paradigm for efficient wastewater treatment and consequent quality biodiesel production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Ethyl pentanoate (EPE) or ethyl valerate is considered a surrogate for biodiesel fuels and a potential fuel for spark ignition engines. Knowledge of its combustion chemistry is of great importance for the development of high-performance and environmentally friendly combustion devices fueled with biofuels. In this work, a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism for the combustion of EPE is developed on the basis of a well-validated kinetic model proposed earlier for short ethyl esters up to ethyl propionate (by Sun et al.). The Sun et al. mechanism was augmented with primary oxidation reactions of ethyl butanoate and ethyl pentanoate and specific intermediates involved in these reactions. The proposed kinetic mechanism was validated against the new experimental data reported in this work on the chemical speciation of laminar premixed flames of stoichiometric EPE/O2/Ar mixtures at low (50 Torr) and atmospheric pressures. The mechanism provided a good predictive capability for experimental mole fraction profiles of many flame intermediates. The new mechanism was also shown to predict well literature experimental data on laminar flame speeds of EPE/air mixtures in a range of equivalence ratios and pressures. The reported flame data can be used for validation of kinetic models for ethyl ester-based biofuels. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We present a new concept of implementing natural, hydrophilic antioxidants in lipophilic biofuels without the necessity of classical surfactants. Hydrotropic glycerol derivatives are used to solubilise hydrophilic anti-oxidative agents in biofuels, such as fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). This concept has several advantages, as the antioxidants are obtainable from plants and usually significantly less hazardous than the synthetic antioxidants, such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) or hydroquinone (HQ), currently used in industry. Additionally, the hydrotropes – or better termed “oleotropes” here – used to solubilise the natural antioxidants exhibit favourable fuel properties, while being obtained by simple addition reactions with glycerol – a largely generated by-product during the biodiesel production in industry. Even more, certain natural antioxidants, such as gallic acid, are shown to exhibit significantly better anti-oxidative properties than their synthetic counterparts. In this context, the polar paradox theory is discussed, proposing that potent antioxidants for biofuels should be hydrophilic and exhibit a low solubility in the fuel. Additionally, the efficacy of phenolic antioxidants is correlated with the bond-dissociation enthalpy (BDE) of their phenolic ArO-H bonds and catechol as well as pyrogallol moieties are concluded to represent key structures for effective antioxidants in biofuels. This is shown by investigating the effects of antioxidants on the oxidative stabilities of FAME/rapeseed oil mixtures and a commercial biofuel. Lastly, the presented concept is further extended to use certain glycerol derivatives first to extract natural, hydrophilic antioxidants from a polyphenol-rich plant, and then to effectively stabilise biofuels with the extraction mixture. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The use of biofuels to power engines reduces the emission of certain undesirable exhaust components. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of second-generation biofuels on the composition of exhaust gases from a Perkins 1104D-44TA diesel engine. For comparison purposes, the same tests were conducted with first-generation biofuel and diesel fuel (DF). The second-generation biofuel was babassu butyl esters (BBuE) produced via transesterification using butyl alcohol and a sulphuric acid catalyst. Currently, methyl or ethyl alcohols and basic catalysts are commonly used to produce esters. The first-generation biofuel used in the tests was rapeseed oil methyl esters (RME). The biofuels used in the tests were produced using patented technology and a reactor developed by one of the co-authors of this paper. With the engine powered by BBuE, the concentrations of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrocarbons and particulate matter in the exhaust gas were reduced in comparison to the engine powered by either DF or RME. Furthermore, by powering the engine with BBuE, lower concentrations of nitrogen oxides were obtained in comparison to its powering with RME. This is because BBuE contains many short-chain esters that are absent in RME. As a result, an engine powered by a new-generation biofuel emits fewer undesirable exhaust gas components into the atmosphere compared to a first-generation biofuel and diesel oil. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Economic viability of biodiesel production relies mainly on the productivity of biomass and microalgal lipids. In addition, production of omega fatty acids is favorable for human nutrition. Thus, enhancement of lipid accumulation with high proportion of omega fatty acids could help the dual use of microalgal lipids in human nutrition and biodiesel production through biorefinery. In that context, phytohormones have been identified as a promising factor to increase biomass and lipids production. However, nitrogen limitation has been discussed as a potential tool for lipid accumulation in microalgae, which results in simultaneous growth retardation. The present study aims to investigate the combined effect of N-depletion and 3-Indoleacetic acid (IAA) supplementa-tion on lipid accumulation of the marine eustigmatophyte Nannochloropsis oceanica as one of the promising microalgae for omega fatty acids production. The study confirmed that N-starvation stimulates the lipid content of N. oceanica. IAA enhanced both growth and lipid accumulation due to enhancement of pigments biosynthesis. Therefore, combination effect of IAA and nitrogen depletion showed gradual increase in the dry weight compared to the control. Lipid analysis showed lower quantity of saturated fatty acids (SFA, 26.25%) than the sum of monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Under N-depletion, SFA decreased by 12.98% compared to the control, which recorded much reduction by increasing of IAA concentration. Reduction of SFA was in favor of PUFA, mainly omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids which increased significantly due to IAA combined with N-depletion. Thus, the present study suggests a biorefinery approach for lipids extracted from N. oceanica for dual application in nutrition followed by biodiesel production. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The shift from fossil to renewable fuels presents an opportunity to tailor a fuel’s molecular structure and composition to the needs of advanced internal combustion engine concepts, while simultaneously aiming for economic and sustainable fuel production. We have recently proposed a method for computer-aided design of tailor-made fuels that integrates aspects of both product and production pathway design. The present paper sets out to sequentially combine that method with experimental investigation on a single cylinder research engine and model-based early-stage process evaluation to create, validate, and benchmark a rationally designed multi-component biofuel for highly boosted spark-ignition engines. To this end, the computer-aided design approach is applied to a network of possible fuel components and their production pathways. The resulting optimal four-component fuel EBCC (50 mol% ethanol, 21 mol% 2-butanone, 15 mol% cyclopentane, and 14 mol% cyclopentanone) is analyzed with regard to combustion performance and estimated fuel production cost. Variations of both the indicated mean effective pressure and the relative air/fuel ratio were performed on an engine equipped with a compression ratio of 14.7. EBCC achieves indicated efficiencies that are significantly higher than those of RON 102 gasoline fuel and comparable to those of pure 2-butanone, an extremely knock-resistant fuel identified in a previous round of model-based fuel design. Furthermore, a strong reduction in engine-out soot emissions is observed compared to RON 102 gasoline. Early-stage process evaluation shows EBCC to have lower estimated fuel production costs than 2-butanone. Production costs of pure ethanol, however, are estimated to be even lower, mainly due to lower plant investment costs and a synthesis pathway that does not require hydrogen. The paper concludes with a brief perspective on further integration of the proposed sequential approach with the goal of co-optimizing the production and combustion of renewable fuel blends. © IMechE 2021.

AB  - In the present paper, an extensive energetic and exergetic assessment of a turbojet engine powered by biofuel, hydrogen and JP-8 fuels is performed in view of the thermodynamic principles. According to the results; when the engine fed with the biofuel, the fuel mass stream incremented from 0.16 to 0.184 kg s−1 compared to the utilization of JP-8 fuel, however, the fuel mass stream decreased from 0.184 to 0.058 kg s−1 compared to the utilization of hydrogen fuel. While the exhaust gaseous mass stream rate increased from 9.21 to 9.234 kg s−1 compared to the utilization of JP-8 fuel, it reduced from 9.234 to 9.108 kg s−1 utilization hydrogen. The produced kinetic energy rate by the turbojet engine which is equal to kinetic exergy rate increased from 1130.62 to 1133.63 kW, it is obtained to be 1118.07 kW for the hydrogen fuel. On the other hand, the energy efficiency of the engine increased from 16.39 to 16.43%, compared to the JP-8 fuel utilization, the specific fuel consumption of the engine rose from 0.035 to 0.040 kg kN−1 s−1, while the exergetic efficiency of the engine decreased from 15.34 to 15.25% compared to the JP-8 fuel usage and increased from 14.36 to 15.25% compared to the hydrogen utilization case. The engine’s environmental effect factor has risen from 5.52 to 5.56 compared to the JP-8 utilization, the exergetic sustainability index of the overall engine increased from 0.168 to 0.180 compared to the hydrogen utilization case. © 2021, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - Environmental pollution and the depletion of fossil fuels have created a growing interest in the world community for renewable energy. Large-scale production of liquid biofuels is supported by governments. Iran is a developing country that supplies its energy needs from fossil fuels. However, clean energy must be used to prevent environmental pollution and ensure food security. In this study, with a case study of Golestan province as one of the leading provinces in the field of agriculture, the existing capacities in this country have been studied. The results showed that 58,945.95 tons of biodiesel and 527.55 million liters of bioethanol can be produced annually in this province. By creating suitable grounds for the production of this fuel, solving technological problems and the support of the people and the government of this province, it is able to supply 2% of the fuel of the country’s gasoline engines. Also, the produced biodiesel can supply approximately 13% of the province’s diesel. Reports indicate that it has the largest share in the production of liquid biofuels in the agricultural waste sector.

AB  - Economically viable alternatives for utilizing municipal solid waste are still a major challenge for society, especially in less developed countries. A potential pathway is using the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) to produce energy, biofuels, organic fertilizers, and value-added chemical compounds. We evaluated an integrated biorefinery structure for the treatment of used cooking oil, pruning biomass, and organic and food residues to produce biodiesel, biogas, organic compost, 1,3-propanediol, and electrical energy at the campus of the Federal University of Pernambuco, which was considered a case study to represent a small city of Northeastern Brazil. A pilot transesterification plant, a biodigestion unit, and a compost unit were installed to process 3.3 tons daily of OFMSW produced. Additionally, research was carried out to produce 1,3-propanediol on a laboratory scale from residual glycerol. The quality of the biodiesel generated from the used cooking oil met national technical standards and the conversion of residual oil into biodiesel reached 93%. The average biogas production was 0.584 ± 0.176 Nm3 kgVS−1, with an average methane production of 50% generating up to 44 MWh of electricity per year. The organic compost produced met the quality requirements of organic fertilizers, such as maturation and nutrient contents. Glycerol treatment increased the yield of 1,3-propanediol production. Our findings demonstrate that the integrated biorefinery will lead to a reduction of US$ 80,000 in the costs of OFMSW management. More importantly, this approach generates incentives for circular economy initiatives in small municipalities in Brazil and other less developed countries.

AB  - Several published studies have evaluated the problems associated with the utilization of biodiesel obtained from safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) oil due to the low oxidative stability, caused by the high content of unsaturated fatty acids. Thus, this study aimed at the extraction of safflower seed oil and its use as an unsaturation source to obtain a synthetic antioxidant. The synthesis of this phenolic additive was done by modifying its structure through the addition of hydroquinone to the unsaturation of the oil, by electrophilic substitution. It was investigated and confirmed that this reaction is promising for obtaining phenolic products, with high yields (83.5%). The product obtained in this research was evaluated as an antioxidant in commercial biodiesel by the Rancimat method, using 5000 ppm of the synthesized additive the induction period increased from 8 to 17 h (2.12 times). Therefore, this paper brought a positive response to the improvement of biodiesel oxidation stability that creates a possibility to increase the use and expansion of this fuel in the market, as utilization of the safflower seed as raw material for additives, bringing a new market for these seeds. © 2021 Sociedade Brasileira de Quimica.

AB  - Bioethanol is a promising biofuel that can be used in the pure form or in the form of ethanol-gasoline blends (EGBs) as a transportation fuel. The combustion of bioethanol in petrol engines is associated with several problems, with bioethanol corrosion effects on metallic construction engine parts being one of the most serious ones. Electrochemical methods, such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, measurement of polarization characteristics (Tafel scan), etc., have been found to be efficient in studying corrosion effects in metal-EGB systems. However, a fuel environment with a low ethanol content (such as E10 and lower) has low conductivity, which can be a limiting factor for electrochemical corrosion studies. Supporting electrolytes can be used to increase the conductivity of such environments. These supporting electrolytes must be inert against the occurring corrosion reactions in order not to negatively affect the obtained corrosion data. In this work, we tested four potential supporting electrolytes (lithium perchlorate, tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate, potassium hexafluorophosphate, and tetrabutylammonium bromide) to be used for the electrochemical corrosion tests on mild steel in the environment of an E85 fuel. In our study, we demonstrated that tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TBATFB) can successfully be used for short-term corrosion studies as it exhibited minimum effects on the obtained electrochemical data even at a relatively high concentration of about 500 mg/L. The use of this supporting electrolyte can substantially facilitate electrochemical corrosion studies in less conductive media such as EGBs with a low content of ethanol. © 2020

AB  - This study presents ethanol's fabrication by fermenting the golden trumpet flower (Allamanda schottii L) with the yeast strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The changes in different parameters during fermentation were studied and optimized while producing the ethanol and the end product was subjected to emission test study by blending petrol and ethanol. The Allamanda floral substrate contains 65% polysaccharides. The strain S. cerevisiae was obtained in the form of baker's yeast from a domestic shop. For 100 ml of slurry, the highest bioethanol yield recorded was about 18.75 ml via optimization of different culture conditions, including a 1:8 ratio for slurry preparation, maintained under 35 ⁰C, 5.5 pH, 72 h. old inoculum with a quantity of 3.75 g 100 ml−1, fermented for120 h. The highest yield of bioethanol was acquired under the addition of urea. This technique &amp; design is capable of industrial-scale fabrication of bioethanol by using A. schottii floral substrates. This research was conducted to fabricate ethanol by fermentation (A. schottii L) floral substrate with S. cerevisiae. The optimum physiochemical parameters required to obtain the highest yield of bioethanol from A. schottii flower by fermentation was studied. The immobilization strategy with a cheap agricultural substrate and magnetic nanoparticles were also studied. The engine performance and emission studies were done with different blends of petrol and bio-ethanol. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - To solve the energy crisis and protect the ecological environment has been the central concern of the sustainable development debate. The reproducibility and lower environmental impacts of bioenergy have attracted increasing attention in the debate. This research investigates the potentials of growing rapeseed in winter fallow fields across the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) to serve the goal of boosting bioenergy production and improving edible oil security in China. It first quantifies the extent of winter fallow fields in the Basin and identifies the accurate starting and ending dates of the fallowing at the grid-cell level. It then matches the fallowing periods with the growing period grid-by-grid and assesses the current and future potentials of rapeseed production across the matched grid-cells in the region. The assessments take into consideration of climate change adaptations on sowing dates and on the choice of varieties with suitable growth cycle length. Finally, by coupling the Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZ) model and CHINAGRO-II economic model, this research simulates economically meaningful levels of rapeseeds production and trade for 2020 and 2030. A 60% realization of the production potential would increase total rapeseed supply by 9.1 million tons, reduce China's rapeseed import to zero and further reduce soybean import by 8.1 million tons in 2020. In 2030, the import of rapeseed would be reduced from 15 million tons under baseline to 7.3 million tons. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The biodiesel production process requires accurate information about its physical properties for monitoring the production process. This work introduced a one-dimensional ternary phononic crystal (1D-TPnC) sensor capable of discriminating and sensing between the acoustic properties of different biodiesel fuels in the ultrasonic range. The sensor structure combines a liquid-filled defect layer into a perfect TPnC. The liquid-filled defect layer restores some of the incident acoustic energy and excites a transmitted resonant dip inside the reflection spectrum. The reflection spectrum of the layered TPnC structure is calculated based on the transfer matrix method (TMM). The simulations showed that the proposed sensor has the feature of being ultra-highly sensitive and selective between the Extra-virgin olive, Tesco sunflower, Methyl Oleate, and Soybean biofuels. The numerical results revealed that Soybean oil has the highest sensitivity (76589 m−1) and Q-factor (267) compared with the other three oils. For Methyl Oleate, the sensitivity and quality factor of the sensor reached the values of about 12680 m−1 and 204, respectively. With increasing the temperature from 30 ∘C to 50 ∘C, the sensitivity increased from 33853Hz/ °C to 36096 Hz/ ∘C for Soybean oil while it decreased from 4064 Hz/ ∘C to 37243 Hz/ ∘C for Methyl Oleate oil. This is because the Soybean oil has a higher speed of sound than Methyl Oleate. The proposed sensor has higher performance than many previously reported PnC sensors. Also, it can be used to determine different types of biodiesel fuels. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - It is the need of the hour to quell the enormous demand of fossil fuels by extending the horizon towards Low Viscous Biofuels. An experimental investigation was carried out to study the performance of the diesel engine, its combustion behaviour and emission aspects while operating it with biofuels viz. camphor oil (CMO), cedarwood oil (CWO), wintergreen oil (WGO) and lemon peel oil (LPO). These fuels were blended with diesel oil by 20% in volume, and the respective blends were compared with the diesel. The engine tests were carried out with a common rail direct injection (CRDi) system. The study unveils that Low Viscous Biofuels blended with diesel form an efficient substitute fuel; starting with the improvement in the brake thermal efficiency, reduced CO2 emissions and reduction in other emissions. The NO emission of low viscous biofuels seems predominately higher. Wintergreen oil as one of the dense and comparatively less viscous fuels among the other chosen biofuels; exhibits 6% improvement in brake thermal efficiency, 3% reduction in brake specific energy consumption, 7% increase in peak pressure, 20% reduction in CO2 emissions, 17% in HC and 20% decrement in smoke. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper presents a new approach to the formulation of fuel surrogates in application to gasoline, diesel, and their biofuel blends (including blends of biodiesel/diesel and ethanol/gasoline). This new approach, described as a ‘Complex Fuel Surrogates Model (CFSM)’, is based on a modified version of the Multi-Dimensional Quasi-Discrete Model (MDQDM). The new approach is aimed to reduce the full composition of fuel to a much smaller number of components based on their mass fractions to formulate fuel surrogates. The formulated surrogates for gasoline and blended ethanol/gasoline fuels matched the data of the full compositions of the same fuels for droplet lifetime, surface temperature, density, vapour pressure, H/C ratio, molar weight and research octane number, using the CFSM. Also, the cetane number and viscosity of diesel and biodiesel/diesel blends were mimicked by their suggested surrogates. The results were verified, with up to 7.2% errors between the two sets of predicted droplet lifetimes: surrogates and full compositions of fuels. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This article provides perspectives on the opportunities and challenges of integrating biomass liquefaction plants (pyrolysis, hydro-pyrolysis, hydrothermal liquefaction, liquefaction in hydrocarbon solvents, etc.) with intermittent renewables such as wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) to provide energy storage and support the development of biofuel production. A techno-economic model is used to assess the levelized cost of electricity from a plant that integrates solar PV with bio-crude production from pyrolysis and its combustion in an engine. The analysis finds that the LCOE for solar PV and biomass pyrolysis is in the range of 65 to 85 USD/MWh when using woody biomass feedstocks, making the scheme competitive with solar PV and lithium-ion batteries. This article also discusses how the integration of biomass liquefaction with intermittent renewables can aid the development of liquid biofuel value-chains by increasing bio-crude supply and supporting the establishment of biorefineries. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Biodiesel has become a promising alternative biofuel that exhibits problems like high cost of feedstock, poor atomisation due to high viscosity, stability issues, poor flow properties and high NOx emissions as compared to conventional diesel. Alcohols have recently drawn much attention as a low cost biofuel that, exhibit problems like low cetane number and miscibility issues. Addition of fuel additives, for example, diethyl ether (DEE), may be effective to overcome the problems with biodiesel or alcohols. In this work, the influence of DEE on engine performance and emissions were investigated for diesel/biodiesel blends, diesel/butanol blends or diesel/pentanol blends. Fuel blends of biodiesel (B20), butanol (BU20), pentanol (PN20), biodiesel with DEE (B20D10), butanol with DEE (BU20D10) and pentanol with DEE (PN20D10) were prepared. Experiments were conducted on a single cylinder diesel engine for varying load conditions at constant speed. Engine performance and emission characteristics were determined and compared.

AB  - Biodiesel is considered the most convenient biofuel, due to its direct use in existing combustion engines; however, its production is not economically optimal due to processes that utilize costly substrates, require high energy expenditure or achieve low biodiesel yields. We used primary sewage sludge for the production of biodiesel and compared yields at different temperatures (40, 50 and 60 °C) and with different organic solvents (chloroform, toluene and hexane), acid catalysts (HCl and H2SO4) and catalyst concentrations (3, 5 and 7%). A maximum of 18 wt% biodiesel was obtained using chloroform with 3% H2SO4 at 40 °C. The conversion efficiency of the primary sludge to biodiesel under these conditions was 86.4%. Based on the fatty acid methyl ester composition of the obtained biodiesel and measured fuel properties, it was deduced that fuel from primary sludge is more suitable for areas with warmer climates than ones that reach temperatures close to 0 °C. However, the fuel properties of the produced biodiesel were within the limits of accepted international standards. We conclude that production of biodiesel from primary sewage sludge under optimized conditions reduces the impact of the feedstock on the environment, decreases overall costs and produces fuel with acceptable properties. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In this study, new results of comparative research on autothermal reforming(ATR) of biofuels (hydrodeoxygenated biodiesel and long- stored biodiesel) over composite RhSC catalysts (0.24 wt.% Rh supported on structured Ce0.75Zr0.25O2-δ-ƞ-Al2O3/FeCrAl carrier) were obtained. The impact of fuel chemical composition on the catalyst performance was discussed. Hydrodeoxygenated biodiesel mainly consisted of heptadecane, other normal alkanes and small amounts of alkenes together with a portion of unreacted fatty acid ethers. RhSC exhibited syngas productivity of about 2.5 m3Lcat−1 h−1 (STP) at complete conversion of hydrodeoxygenated biodiesel without considerable by-products formation, at molar ratios O2/C = 0.54, H2O/C = 3, T =750 °C and GHSV =5000 h−1. The catalyst exhibited stable operation and no coke formation for at least 90 h on stream. Biodiesel after nine years storage, which was used in this study, contained methyl esters of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids and a large proportion of polymeric compounds. It was successfully demonstrated that even this aged biodiesel can be converted to synthesis gas over the developed Rh/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2-δ-ƞ-Al2O3/FeCrAl structured catalyst. Further optimization of the catalyst and reaction conditions (higher temperature, lower GHSV, catalyst doping by promoters) is required for reaching efficient reforming of the aged biodiesel. Nevertheless, it was demonstrated that biodiesel and hydrodeoxygenated biodiesel, which combine high energy density and renewability, were very attractive biofuels for fuel cell-based power unit applications. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Low energy density in agricultural or biotechnological raw materials dictates the need for their local processing. Small-scale agricultural products or waste processing plants can`t profitably use technologies common in large-scale petrochemistry, including the complex and expensive process of steam reforming of biogas into syngas for its subsequent conversion to liquid fuel. The work suggests using small-scale sources of inexpensive and easily obtained biogas and other renewable hydrocarbon gases for the production of liquid biofuel by their air conversion in recently developed matrix reformers into low-cost nitrogen-rich syngas, followed by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis in a cascade of sequential reactors. Autothermal matrix reformers are very compact, simple in design, have several times more specific volume capacity than traditional technologies, and allow processing biogas with a high concentration of CO2. The advantages of low-cost conversion of biogas to liquid fuel based on nitrogen- enriched syngas with subsequent Fischer-Tropsch synthesis are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Increasing resource demand, predicted fossil resources shortage in the near future, and environmental concerns due to the production of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide have motivated the search for alternative ‘circular’ pathways. Among many options, microalgae have been recently ‘revised’ as one of the most promising due to their high growth rate (with low land use and without competing with food crops), high tolerance to nutrients and salts stresses and their variability in biochemical composition, in so allowing the supply of a plethora of possible bio-based products such as animal feeds, chemicals and biofuels. The recent raising popularity of Circular Bio-Economy (CBE) further prompted investment in microalgae, especially in combination with wastewater treatment, under the twofold aim of allowing the production of a wide range of bio-based products while bioremediating wastewater. With the aim of discussing the potential bio-products that may be gained from microalgae grown on urban wastewater, this paper presents an overview on microalgae production with particular emphasis on the main microalgae species suitable for growth on wastewater and the obtainable bio-based products from them. By selecting and reviewing 76 articles published in Scopus between 1992 and 2020, a number of interesting aspects, including the selection of algal species suitable for growing on urban wastewater, wastewater pretreatment and algal-bacterial cooperation, were carefully reviewed and discussed in this work. In this review, particular emphasis is placed on understanding of the main mechanisms driving formation of microalgal products (such as biofuels, biogas, etc.) and how they are affected by different environmental factors in selected species. Lastly, the quantitative information gathered from the articles were used to estimate the potential benefits gained from microalgae grown on urban wastewater in Campania Region, a region sometimes criticized for poor wastewater management. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Ni-base catalysts are promising candidate for the hydrogenation of furfural (FAL) to high-value chemicals. However, slow intermediate desorption and low selectivity limit its implementation. Identifying the catalytic performance of each active sites is vital to design hydrogenation catalyst, and tuning the geometrical sites at molecule level in PtNi could lead to the modification of electronic structure, and thus the selectity for the hydrogenation of FAL was modulated. Herein, PtNi hollow nanoframes (PtNi HNFs) with three dimensional (3D) molecular accessibility were synthesized, EDX results suggested that Ni was evenly distributed inside of the hollow nanoframes, whereas Pt was relatively concentrated at the edges. DFT calculation demonstrated that PtNi significant decrease the desorption energy of the intermediates. This strategy could not only enhance the desorption of intermediates to improve the catalytic performance, but also transfer the adsorption mode of FAL on catalyst surface to selective hydrogenation of FAL to FOL or THFA. The PtNi HNFs catalyst afforded excellent catalytic performance for selective hydrogenation of a broad range of biomass-derived platform chemicals under mild conditions, especially of FAL to furfuryl alcohol (FOL), in quantitative FOL yields (99%) with a high TOF of 2.56 h−1. It is found that the superior performance of PtNi HNFs is attributed to its 3D hierarchical structure and synergistic electronic effects between Pt and Ni. Besides, the kinetic study demonstrated that the activation energy for hydrogenation of FAL was as low as 54.95 kJ mol−1. © 2021 Science Press

AB  - Biomass inventories and techno-economic supply studies tend to overestimate economic supply of crop and timber residues, because they ignore human decisions on whether to permit residue removal. By combining information about biophysical availability, production and delivery costs, and the willingness of different types of decision maker to permit removal of logging residues, we develop a realistic prediction of economic supply that becomes very price inelastic. Because managers of only 52% of Michigan and Wisconsin forestland studied would allow the removal of logging residues, we conclude that most forecasts overestimate residue biomass supply by 50 to 100%. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - In the present research, biodiesels were prepared from Mahua and Jatropha oil by two-step transesterification. The physicochemical characteristics (viz. density, acid value, iodine value, kinematic viscosity, cloud-pour point, fire-flash point) of prepared biodiesels were evaluated. Finally, the prepared biodiesels were blended with mineral diesel in different proportion and physicochemical characteristics of blended dual biofuel sample blends were also evaluated in order to determine the best blend. The results revealed that the dual biofuel samples met the requirements of EN-14214 (Europe standards), ASTM D-6751 (USA standards) and IS-15607 (India standards). A set of regression equations were also formulated, this mathematical model revealed that different physicochemical properties had high values of the regression coefficient (R2) up to 0.986 for various proportions of blend samples. The obtained results have shown that the pre-treatment process can effectively reduce the free fatty acid value to less than 1% for biodiesels. Further, the values of density and kinematic viscosity were found to be better for sample blends B10, B20, and B30, while B40 was on the upper-end limit and B50 was found to be out of limit range. Furthermore, it was concluded that the sample blends B30 (with 15% blending of each biodiesel) and B40 (with 20% blending of each biodiesel) had better properties and can be used further to test their fuel combustion characteristics on a diesel engine. © 2020 King Saud University

AB  - Partial hydrogenation of soybean oil-derived fatty acid methyl esters was studied using MCM-41 mesoporous silica-supported Pd-Pt bimetallic catalysts with tunable porosity under mild reaction conditions (100 °C, 0.4 MPa H2, 4 h). This process produced partially hydrogenated fatty acid methyl esters (H-FAME) as a new type of high-quality biodiesel fuel enriched in monounsaturated fatty acid methyl esters (mono-FAME), which is a potential source for formulating high blends of biodiesel fuel with petrodiesel. MCM-41 supports with various structural properties and morphologies were synthesized by self-assembly with different amounts of ammonia solution as a mineralizing agent. Bimetallic Pd-Pt nanoparticles with a Pd/Pt atomic ratio of 4 were stepwise impregnated on three MCM-41 supports, resulting in a series of Pd-Pt/MCM-41 bimetallic catalysts with tunable porosity (0.89–1.79 cm3 g−1), average pore size (3.2–8.5 nm), and particle size (0.12–0.62 μm). The Pd-Pt/MCM-41 catalyst prepared with the least amount of ammonia produced the best partial hydrogenation conversion of polyunsaturated FAME into mono-FAME, ascribed to nano-aggregation resulting in a dual-pore system containing large pores for fast molecular diffusion; a high turnover frequency (1920 h−1), larger k1 rate constant (0.60 gcat−1h−1), and smaller k2 rate constant (0.37 gcat−1h−1) were obtained. Furthermore, this Pd-Pt/MCM-41 catalyst exhibited excellent sulfur resistance in the synthesis of H-FAME, even though the feedstocks contained approximately 5 ppm of sulfur contaminates. These results demonstrate that the sulfur-resistant Pd-Pt/MCM-41 bimetallic catalysts with stable and dual pore system are beneficial for obtaining higher quality BDF to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biological CO2 sequestration from flue gas using microalgae has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional carbon capture technologies, since it concurrently generates valuable biomass which can be utilized to produce biofuels. In the current study, the locally isolated microalga Desmodesmus sp. was utilized for sequestration of CO2 from gas mixtures simulating undiluted cement flue gas (1x), and cement flue gas diluted by two-fold (1/2x), four-fold (1/4x) and eight-fold (1/8x). The current study aimed to assess the feasibility of maintaining high CO2 sequestration rates in nitrogen-limited culture media while simultaneously producing biomass rich in target metabolites for biofuel production. Accordingly, Bold's Basal Medium (BBM) and BBM with three times the standard nitrate concentration (3N-BBM) were employed as culture media for nitrogen limited and nitrogen replete experiments respectively. The highest CO2 fixation rates were demonstrated in undiluted flue gas containing 15.50% CO2. Moreover, the average CO2 fixation rate of Desmodesmus sp. over the 8-day cultivation period (0.21 ± 0.02 g/L/d) was not significantly reduced in nitrate limited media (BBM). Nitrate limited cultivation in undiluted flue gas enhanced the accumulation of carbohydrates in microalgae (32.44 ± 0.45% and 327.65 ± 23.39 mg/L), although the increment in lipid content was not as significant as expected (41.54 ± 1.13% and 419.57 ± 31.52 mg/L). Biodiesel properties of microalgal lipids were within the limits of the ASTM D6751-12 standard. Higher heating values of microalgae biomass were in the range of 21.97-23.17 MJ/kg. Nonetheless, pilot scale studies using actual flue gas are essential prior to microalgal biofuel production and simultaneous CO2 sequestration. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The current research dwells the experimental investigation together with artificial neural networks analysis on vibration and noise intensity of VCR diesel engine energized with flaxseed oil biodiesel blends. The tests were carried out at four different loads, namely 25, 50, 75, and 100% and three compression ratios (16.5, 17.5, and 18.5). The vibration levels were measured at different locations of the engine body which accounts for the development of bulk vibration. The RMS acceleration (vibration) and RMS noise were calculated. The flaxseed biodiesel mixes have shown the positive outcome concerning vibration and noise intensities, and FSOME20 (20% blend) was revealed inferior to leftover fuel samples. Besides, the intensity of vibration and noise was seen superior at higher compression ratios and loads. The identical disparity was observed irrespective of the fuel samples. At peak load, the RMS acceleration of FSOME20 was reduced by 12.2, 12.05, and 16.74%, while the RMS noise was brought down by 6.8, 9.6, and 7.23% at CR16.5, CR17.5, and CR18.5, respectively. Finally, the experimental results were compared with artificial neural networks (ANNs) predicted outcomes. The coefficient of correlation (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE) noticed were 0.965 and 0.12% intended for vibration, whereas 0.989 and 0.56% for noise correspondingly. © 2020, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - High cost of microalgal biofuel is caused by all the steps in current technology, including cultivation, harvesting, lipid extraction, biofuel processing and wastewater and waste treatment. This study aims to systematically reduce these costs with one integrated process, in which carbonate is used for cell rupture, lipid extraction and biodiesel processing, and then recycled for CO2 absorption and carbon supply for a new round of algae cultivation. To reach this goal, carbonate-heating treatment with N, N′ – dibutylurea which can enhance cell disruption were used for cell-wall breaking of wet Neochloris oleoabundans (UTEX 1185) biomass. Lipid extraction was fulfilled with carbonate/ethanol aqueous two phase extraction method and residual carbonate with wastewater from bottom phase was recycled to absorb CO2 to generate bicarbonate for algal cultivation with fresh medium. Taking into comprehensive consideration of cell disruption efficiency, partition coefficient, and lipid recovery, the condition of cell disruption and lipid extraction was set at 90 °C, 100 min reaction time, 1:7.5 DBU:H2O (w/w) ratio, 1:3 Na2CO3:H2O (w/w) ratio, and 9% (w/wT) ethanol concentration. The results showed that carbonate-heating treatment of wet N. oleoabundans biomass resulted in up to 90.7% cell disruption efficiency. The lipid recovery rate in carbonate/ethanol system was up to 97.9%, and the final biodiesel production was 1.30 times of that with Soxhlet method. Utilization of the waste broth after CO2 absorption with the content of 4% (v/vT) in the medium for new batch of algae cultivation resulted in biomass concentration of 1.68 g/L. The corresponding total fatty acids production was 0.35 g/L, which was 1.63 fold of that with fresh medium. This study firstly proved the feasibility of using carbonate for lipid extraction and biodiesel production and recycle waste carbonate for carbon re-supply during algae cultivation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Environmental concerns due to fossil fuel usage has turned the research interest towards biomass and bioenergy field. Renewable biomass such as microalgae provides numerous advantages as they can grow in wastewater; sequester carbon dioxide, economical and eco-friendly. In this study, effect of pretreatment of microalgae (Scenedesmus obliquus) biomass using post-hydrothermal liquefaction wastewater (PHWW) for bio-oil production through hydrothermal liquefaction at a temperature of 300 °C was studied. Results showed liquefaction of pre-treated biomass yielded 48.53% bio-oil whereas 28.35% was resulted from biomass without pretreatment. The analysis of higher heating value of bio-oil showed that pretreated biomass oil has 36.19 MJ.Kg−1 against non-pretreated biomass oil, which has 28.88 MJ.Kg−1. Bio-oil (pretreated biomass) analysis revealed that 60% of compounds are in diesel and gasoline range with 58.09% of energy recovery. Bio-oil was rich in hydrocarbons of C7-C21 range with less oxygenated compounds. Carbon balance showed that an increase of 13% of carbon was sequestered in solid residue obtained from pretreated biomass and about 146% of increase also obtained in bio-oil. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The UK faces unprecedented environmental challenges which require urgent action. The promotion of renewable energy sources is a promising solution to tackle these challenges. Among these, syngas production from biogas via dry reforming of methane shows great potential as a green alternative to meet global environmental goals. The purpose of this work is to estimate the potential of syngas production from biogas in the UK and its profitability. To estimate the syngas production, we present an overview of methane dry reforming to syngas. This analysis reveals that nickel/alumina catalysts are the most popular choice for the mentioned reaction. Afterwards, the potential biogas production in the UK is obtained. Both set of data are subsequently combined to estimate the potential for syngas production from biomass in the UK. A techno-economic analysis is performed to estimate the syngas price to reach profitability. This analysis reveals syngas prices ranging from 1.15 to 1.56 €/m3 to overcome production costs, which is higher than producing syngas from traditional fossil fuels. Further analysis has also been conducted to estimate the production of different utilisation routes for said syngas including biofuel, methanol and electricity. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - The phytohormone producing Streptomyces rosealbus MTTC 12,951 (S.R) and green microalga Chlorella vulgaris MSU-AGM 14 (C.V) were cultivated in co-culture system to evaluate exogenous hormonal activity. Biosynthesis of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and their precursors were quantitatively evaluated by employing High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The concentration of IAA (0.72 ± 0.02 µg mL−1) was observed to be elevated in co-cultivation system due to symbiotic interaction between Streptomyces and microalgae. In exchange, microalgae produced adequate volume of tryptophan (Trp) to induce IAA biosynthesis. The Trp stress in late exponential phase encouraged lipid accumulation (175 ± 10 mg g−1). The bioflocculation property of microalgae ensures potential and economic viable harvesting process by reducing 148% input energy compared to conventional method. The overall results evidenced that C.V co-cultivation with S.R exhibits promotional behavior and serves as a promising cultivation process for microalgae in terms of cost efficiency and energy conservation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Drying is a very important stage in the treatment of spent coffee grounds destined to biofuels production. The mass transfer during the convective drying of spent coffee grounds generated in the soluble coffee industry is analyzed. An experimental design from sixteen isothermal drying experiments for different sample thicknesses (5 mm, 10 mm, 15 mm and 20 mm) and drying air temperatures (100 °C, 150 °C, 200 °C and 250 °C) using a drying air velocity of 1 m s−1 was proposed. Drying times, drying rates and effective diffusivity coefficients were obtained. Drying curves were fitted with the main mathematical model proposed in the literature, and the drying rates were studied from the moisture ratio and the drying air temperature. Constant and time-dependence effective diffusivity was evaluated using polynomial surface models. Drying times range between 18 min (test at 5 mm and 250 °C) and 3 h (test at 20 mm and 100 °C). Drying rate and effective diffusivity values were found between 0.0000226 and 0.001722 s−1 and 1.79 × 10−9 and 29.1 × 10−9 m2 s−1, respectively. The main differences between these experiments and those carried out by the same authors about the drying of spent coffee grounds obtained in the services sector were studied and analyzed. © 2020, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - Numerous studies explored the possibility and effective strategies for supplementing hydrogen along with fossil or biofuels on internal combustion engines. Hydrogen is also being employed for formulating fuels such as hydrogen compressed natural gas in the gaseous form and hydrogenated biofuels in the liquid form. The present study evaluates (i) hydrogen usage on the fuel formulation and (ii) investigates the engine operation of an automotive turbocharged diesel engine operated with karanja biodiesel blended diesel (B20) as a reference fuel. Existing literature outlines that biodiesel blends possess lower energy content and emit higher nitric oxide (NO) emission than fossil diesel. The present research paper partially hydrogenates karanja biodiesel using an autoclave reactor with a palladium catalyst to increase the saturation levels and mitigate the biodiesel-NO penalty. Besides, the drop in energy release of B20 is compensated through the provision of hydrogen induction along the intake manifold. The hydrogen flow rates to the turbocharged engine are maintained at a fixed energy share of 10%. Both biodiesel and hydrogenated biodiesel were blended on a volume basis (20%) with fossil diesel (80%) and are designated as B20 and HB20, respectively. The test results reveal that HB20 effectively mitigates the biodiesel-NO penalty with a maximum reduction of 29.8% compared to B20. Further, hydrogen induction yielded a significant improvement (23.7%) in fuel consumption with HB20 relative to B20 without hydrogen addition. The compounding effect of hydrogen usage on the engine operation and fuel formulation exhibited a better performance and emission trade-off at mid load conditions. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - The present study endeavours to exploit the benefits of reactivity controlled operation by leveraging significantly higher methanol participation through a decoupled methanol utilization strategy with Madhuca Longifolia biodiesel and conventional diesel as the pilot fuel under varying split injection profiles. The investigation was carried out at 10%, 25% and 50% pilot mass percentage, while the injection timings of pilot and main injection were varied in between −35 and −55 and −5 to −15 aTDC respectively. The results showed that the higher methanol participations caused longer ignition delays which lead to the shifting of the CA50 rightwards beyond the top dead centre. Reduction in maximum pressure rise rate was also evident in the RCCI regime. Compared to the baseline operation of single injection, the methanol/biodiesel RCCI operation under split injection strategy observed a maximum of 86% enhancement in exergy efficiency along with the maximum reductions in NOx and Soot emissions as 86% and 96% respectively. Furthermore, the analysis of Pareto solutions revealed that the methanol/biodiesel RCCI operation yielded 2.8% higher exergy efficiency along with 94% lower emissions of soot compared to its diesel counterpart, while the methanol/diesel operations exhibited 35% lower NOx emissions compared to the equivalent biodiesel RCCI operation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study focuses on optimizing the engine operating parameters of a dual-fuel (DF) engine. Producer gas (PG) and Honge oil methyl ester (HOME) are used as primary fuel and pilot fuel respectively for the operation. An experimental design matrix of 20 different combinations was considered using Design of Experiments (DoE), based on the central composite design (CCD) of response surface methodology (RSM). The effects of these combinations were experimentally investigated to calculate the performance and emission characteristics of the engine. The objective of the work is to maximize the Brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and minimize the exhaust gas temperature (EGT), nitrogen oxide (NOx), hydrocarbon (HC), and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions. The RSM model is developed using the experimental data and further, the operating parameters were optimized using the desirability approach. The optimized combination of operating parameters was obtained at 61.10% engine load, compression ratio (CR) of 18, and injection timing (IT) of 23.30° before top dead center (BTDC). The optimum responses corresponding to these operating conditions were found as 14.23%, 354.29 °C, 52.18 ppm, 39.53 ppm, and 0.51% for BTE, EGT, NOx, HC, and CO respectively with an overall desirability of 0.962. The optimized responses were validated experimentally at optimum input conditions and found to be within acceptable error levels. Further, an economic analysis of the optimized DF system is also carried out. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A terpene-based biorefinery is described that uses crude sulfate turpentine (CST) and gum turpentine (GT) to produce mixtures of p-menthadienes (p-MeDs) as biorenewable terpene feedstocks. An acid catalyzed ring opening reaction (6 m aq. H2SO4, 90 °C) is first used to convert the major bicyclic monoterpenes (α-pinene, β-pinene, and 3-carene) in untreated CST (or GT with 5 mol% Me2S) into mixtures of monocyclic p-MeDs. These unpurified sulfurous p-MeD mixtures (α-terpinene, γ-terpinene, and isoterpinolene) are then used as feedstocks for oxidative aromatization (OA), ozonolysis, Diels–Alder, and hydrogenation reactions to produce p-cymene, fragrances, anti-oxidants, drugs, biopolymers, and biofuels. Mechanistic studies of the OA reaction used to convert the p-MeDs into p-cymene reveal that p-cymene hydroperoxide acts as an initiator to produce polar radical intermediates that are stabilized by DMSO generated in situ through aerobic oxidation of Me2S. This enables CST and GT to be converted into biorenewable p-cymene in 50–60% yields (two steps) using a process that only requires aqueous acid, oxygen, heat, and a final distillation step. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Developing countries located in the tropics have favorable climates to develop modern agriculture and agriculture-based industry. Peru and Indonesia are examples of two developing countries located in the tropics with economies based on the export of agricultural products. The generation of agricultural and forest residues has continuously increased in these countries. In this paper, we analyze the availability of agricultural and forest products in Peru and Indonesia in order to calculate the number of residues that could potentially be used for different applications such as energy generation and composite materials production. A single index taking into account the technical, economic, and environmental performance of these residues-based products was utilized to compare them. The results showed that, in addition to the generation of energy, the production of plastic bio-based composites and activated carbon are viable alternatives for the use of these residues. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - The remarkable journey of progression of mankind has created various impacts in the form of polluted environment, amassed heavy metals and depleting resources. This alarming situation demands sustainable energy resources and approaches to deal with these environmental hazards and power deficit. Pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis address both energy and environmental issues caused by civilization and industrialization. The processes use hazardous waste materials including waste tires, plastic and medical waste, and biomass waste such as livestock waste and agricultural waste as feedstock to produce gas, char and pyrolysis oil for energy production. Usage of hazardous materials as pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis feedstock reduces disposal of harmful substances into environment, reducing occurrence of soil and water pollution, and substituting the non-renewable feedstock, fossil fuels. As compared to combustion, pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis have less emission of air pollutants and act as alternative options to landfill disposal and incineration for hazardous materials and biomass waste. Hence, stabilizing heavy metals and solving the energy and waste management problems. This review discusses the pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis of biomass and harmful wastes to strive towards circular economy and eco-friendly, cleaner energy with minimum waste disposal, reducing negative impact on the planet and creating future possibilities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Catalytic hydrotreating of algae bio-crude oil from hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of Nannochloropsis sp. was performed. Different Ni-based catalysts, including Ni/γ-Al2O3, Ni-Cu/γ-Al2O3, Ni-Re/γ-Al2O3, and Ni-Cu-Re/γ-Al2O3, (10%Ni, 5%Cu, 2.5%Re) were used in upgrading of the bio-crude oil. Most catalytic systems could effectively eliminate S and decrease the N and O contents, and enhance more than 20% improvement in the higher heating value (HHV) of the bio-oil (34 to 41–45 MJ/kg). Introducing only Cu could enhance the C[dbnd]O hydrogenation resulting in higher aromatic and alcohol compounds. While the addition of Re is effective for hydrodeoxygenation, it lowers denitrogenation due to amination reaction. Ni-Cu-Re/γ-Al2O3 ternary alloy offered the best results on the overall performance, achieving the highest upgraded bio-oil yield of 58 wt% and the highest energy recovery in the upgrading process (ERupgrade) of 64.6%. As ER in HTL process (ERHTL) was ca. 71.8%, the overall ER (ERoverall) from algae biomass to upgraded bio-oil of 46.4% can be achieved for Ni-Cu-Re/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. Carbon efficiency approx. 47.7% can be attained as the carbon in the algae biomass feedstock was retained in the upgraded bio-oil. In addition, reaction pathways for the formation of different hydrotreated products catalyzed by mono-, bi-, and tri- metallic Ni-Cu-Re have been proposed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The utilisation of waste biomass in biodiesel production as a sustainable energy source can lead to the incorporation of circular bioeconomy principles in the current economic systems. Herein, we synthesised a magnetically recyclable solid acid catalyst for the esterification of waste date seed oil. The catalysts possessed superparamagnetic behaviour and high saturation magnetisation, allowing them to be easily separated from the reaction mixture using an external magnetic filed. The esterification reaction was modelled and optimised by RSM (Design Expert program) and parametric study. The magnetic solid acid catalyst showed high catalytic performance with 91.4% biodiesel yield with optimum conditions of residence time, catalyst loading and temperature of 47 min, 1.5 wt %, and 55 °C, respectively. The solid catalyst was easily recovered by simple magnetic decantation and reused five consecutive times without significant degradation in its catalytic activity. This approach of using waste date seed coupled with cheap magnetic solid acid catalyst has the potential to create more sustainable and cost-effective catalytic systems for biodiesel production. This will complete the full cycle of waste date seed sustainably and facilitate the development of circular bioeconomy. The LCA results by using CML-IA baseline V3.06 midpoint indicators, for 1000 kg of biodiesel production showed the cumulative abiotic depletion of fossil resources over all the processes as 19037 MJ, global warming potential as 1114 kg CO2 eq, and human health toxicity as 633 kg 1,4-DB eq (kg 1,4 dichlorobenzene equivalent). The highest damage in all categories was observed during catalyst preparation, and reuse, which was also confirmed in endpoint LCA findings performed using ReCiPe 2016 Endpoint (E) V1.04. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fossil depletion is facing critical crisis due to its depletion reserves and increased environmental problems. The utilization of petroleum products by the dense population, urbanization of various geographical areas and industrialization has extremely affected the global economy. Fuels of biological origin such as ethanol, vegetable oil and various biomasses are gaining attention It is therefore important to develop alternative fuels in order to protect the global environment and also to focus on long-term supplies of conventional fuels. These biofuels have greater opportunity to promote agro-industrial development and productivity in large scale. Thus, it is necessary to improvise technology and develop resource sustainability focussing into the appropriate policies, production costing, yield, purity and efficiency creating health, wealth and benefit sharing to achieve a sustainable energy in future. The present review article focuses on the recent trends and researches carried out in liquid biofuel production and economy holding its future demand and utilization world-wide. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Crude bio-oils, as sustainable and renewable energy sources generated from thermochemical conversion of forest, agriculture, waste and algae biomass feedstocks, have attracted particular attention to partially and even completely replace the fossil fuels over the past decades. However, due to their undesirable qualities such as high oxygen content, thermal instability, and high corrosivity, further upgrading is required for the direct application of bio-oils for petrol engines or thermal power plants. Various upgrading pathways, including emulsification, hydrotreating, supercritical fluid treatment, and co-processing are being investigated by different international research groups to produce marketable drop-in renewable transportation biofuels. Among them, co-processing bio-oils with petroleum streams in existing refineries is recognized as a more promising solution compared to other conventional upgrading methods because of less capital investment and higher fuel productivity. This work reviewed the up-to-date research activities in bio-oil co-processing including process scale-up, focusing more on the most recent work about pyrolysis oils co-processing in the fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) unit and its industrial implementation. The significant knowledge gaps in the co-processing are also outlined for future investigations. © 2020

AB  - The use of diesel-farnesane and sugarcane biodiesel is showing significant potential for reducing harmful emissions from Brazilian road transport. Both biofuels are obtained from sugarcane through synthetic biology that requires fermentation. The present work studies the effect of the sugarcane biofuels, compared to regular diesel fuel, on the performance and emissions of a modern medium-duty diesel engine following the European Steady Cycle (ESC) test procedure. Diesel-farnesane showed the lowest particulate matter (PM) specific emissions. Specific nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions from diesel fuel were above the standard limit, while sugarcane biodiesel produced the lowest emissions. All tested fuels produced specific carbon monoxide (CO) emissions below the standard limit, but the biofuels showed higher values than the reference fuel. Sugarcane biodiesel showed an inhibition effect on the oxidation process at the Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC), leading to the highest specific CO emissions after the DOC. Specific total hydrocarbons (THC) emissions were well below the standard limits for all tested fuels. Concerning the regulated emissions for diesel engines (g/h), the use of sugarcane biodiesel led to PM and NOx reductions of 32.4% and 37.3%, while diesel-farnesane led to 41.7% and 6.08% reductions, respectively. These notable reductions in harmful emissions support the application of sugarcane biofuels to road transport. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel side stream waste glycerol was identified as a cheap carbon source for rhamnolipids (RLs) production which at the same time could improve the management of waste. The present study aimed to produce RLs by using Pseudomonas aeruginosa RS6 utilizing waste glycerol as a substrate and to evaluate their physico-chemicals properties. Fermentation conditions such as temperature, initial medium pH, waste glycerol concentration, nitrogen sources and concentrations resulted in different compositions of the mono- and di-RLs produced. The maximum RLs production of 2.73 g/L was obtained when P. aeruginosa RS6 was grown in a basal salt medium supplemented with 1% waste glycerol and 0.2 M sodium nitrate at 35 °C and pH 6.5. At optimal fermentation conditions, the emulsification index (E24) values of cooking oil, diesel oil, benzene, olive oil, petroleum, and kerosene were all above E24=50%. The surface tension reduction obtained from 72.13 mN/m to 29.4–30.4 mN/m was better than the surface activity of some chemical-based surfactants. The RLs produced possessed antimicrobial activities against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria with values ranging from 37% to 77% of growth inhibition when 1 mg/mL of RLs was used. Concentrations of RLs below 1500 μg/mL did not induce phytotoxicity effects on the tested seeds (Vigna radiata) compared to the chemical-based- surfactant, SDS. Furthermore, RLs tested on zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos only exhibited low acute toxicity with an LC50 value of 72.97 μg/mL at 48 h of exposure suggesting a green and eco-biochemical worthy of future applications to replace chemical-based surfactants. Pseudomonas aeruginosa RS6 shows the ability to consume biodiesel side stream waste glycerol for the production of green biochemicals and less-toxic rhamnolipids. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Abstract: In Europe, recent regulations on advanced biofuels have prompted a search for new fuel sources and the development of synthesis methods meeting the demanding specifications of the sector. However, in developing countries such as Algeria, where a significant stock of frying oil is unused, the use of diesel engines powered with waste-oil-derived biofuels must be explored. In this work, the variables related to the transesterification reaction from this frying oil with ethanol are analyzed using response surface methodology. From this analysis, only the reaction time and temperature have been determined as relevant parameters. In addition, FT-IR analysis has proven a useful tool to analyse the conversion in the transesterification reaction of waste frying oil with ethanol and is cheaper and quicker than GC-FID. This sustainable biofuel (FAEE), mixed with a diesel and pure fuel, has been physically characterized. The mixture of FAEE at 30% by volume with diesel meets the requirements demanded in standard EN 590 and can be classified as winter diesel class D. As a pure biofuel, only its high cold flow temperatures could constitute a drawback for exporting to temperate climates but not for internal consumption.

AB  - Carbon dioxide utilization (CDU) is one of the most critical approaches in climate change control. CDU's future depends on the future demand for carbon-derived products; among them, formic acid is an excellent candidate due to its distinctive characteristics as a hydrogen carrier in liquid form. It is non-toxic that can be used in hydrogen fuel cells, and its significant potential in the heavy oil and biofuel refining process as a hydrogen-carrier substance. This research aims to use Energy, Exergy, Exergoeconomic, and exergoenvironmental (4E) analysis to evaluate the impact of anolyte material on the efficiency of the electrochemical reduction process to synthesis formic acid (in the term of six new anolyte materials). Results show that the second scenario (IrO2 single circulation mode) is the best option for the power plant. Implementing this CDU system reduces the carbon capture of about 75.20 kg/s or about 89% of the power plant's overall carbon emission. This process's energy penalty can be adequately provided by the PV, which causes greater exergy efficiency and decreases the power plant's energy performance rate. Moreover, the use of IrO2 anolyte is decreased the exergy rate cost and the flow rate cost to the 0.21 $/kWh and 2.280×10-2 $/s. The CDU's investment cost using the DSA/O2 anolyte is 28% decreased compared to the KOH anolyte and reached 7.2 million USD for the CO2 utilization plant. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - For the first time, this work investigates the achievability of developing a biorefinery concept around almond hulls by hydrothermal treatment (HTT), thoroughly scrutinising the influence of the temperature (200–300 °C), pressure (100–180 bar), time (20–180 min) and solid loading (5–25 wt%). This process allowed the conversion of almond hulls into four main products: gas (2–13%), bio-oil (2–12%), aqueous (4–69%) and hydro-char (17–89%). The gas consisted of a mix of H2, CO2, CO and CH4 with a LHV fluctuating from 1 to 13 MJ/m3 STP. The bio-oil comprised a mixture of alkanes, aldehydes, ketones, phenols, furans, benzenes and nitrogen compounds with a HHV between 21 and 31 MJ/kg. The solid product resembled an energetic hydro-char material (HHV 21–31 MJ/kg), while the aqueous effluent comprised a mixture of value-added chemicals, including saccharides and small oxygenated compounds. The production of biofuels can be maximised at 256 °C and 100 bar, using a 5 wt% solid loading for 157 min, conditions at which 43% of the original feedstock can be converted into an elevated energy-filled bio-oil (11% yield, 30 MJ/kg), along with a high energetic hydro-char (32% yield, 29 MJ/kg). Regarding value-added chemicals, up to 10% of the almond hulls can be converted into a bio-oil with a high proportion (45%) of phenolic species at 250 °C and 144 bar with a solid loading of 5 wt% for 167 min. In comparison, a sugar-rich (81 C-wt%) solution can be produced in high yield (54%), by treating a 24 wt% suspension at 252 °C and 180 bar for 153 min. Therefore, the versatility, novelty and intrinsic green and holistic nature of this ‘almond-refinery’ concept exemplify a landmark achievement in future energy and chemicals production from biomass, which might help render the complete bio-refinery for almond hulls more cost-effectively and ecologically feasible. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sustainable reductions in energy and time requirements in fried palm oil (Borassus flabellifer) biodiesel (FPOB) production (97% yield) have been achieved in differently powered reactors viz., low-energy infrared radiation (LEIR) (0.131 kWh) and LEIR with ultrasonic-energy (LEIRUE) (0.12 kWh) in comparison with conventional heating energy (CHE: 0.664 kWh). Life cycle assessment (LCA) employing IMPACT 2002 + indicated adverse environmental impacts of energy-intensive CHE reactor generating 28.4% more respiratory organics, 67.6% augmented global warming and additional 38.3% energy utilization in comparison with the novel LEIRUE reactor. Feasibility of 2-ethylhexyl acetate (2EHA), triacetin (TA), and 5 other esters were assessed as fuel additives (FAs) for FPOB (B100) and diesel-FPOB (B10) in conventional diesel engine. The optimal 1:1 v/v mix of the two best FAs (2EHA + TA) i.e., ETA was blended in 5, 7, and 10 vol% with B10 and B100 for impact assessment. Remarkably, the best 7 vol% ETA blending could successfully diminish pour point and NOx emission by 36 ± 1% and 28 ± 1% respectively for B100. The LCA also confirmed that 7 vol% ETA (for B10 and B100) blending could manage all the impact categories ascertaining environmental sustainability. Thus, ETA can find applications as a potent FA for B100 and B10 blends. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

Recycling the aqueous phase in algal hydrothermal liquefaction increased biocrude production yield by 18.9% at 350 °C, although a 12.2% increase in the biocrude nitrogen content was observed. In the second recycling, the nitrogen content increased to 17.6%, which is not environmentally favourable for direct usage in diesel engines due to the possible increase in Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) emissions. Recycling the aqueous phase in Spirulina Platensis feedstock liquefaction led to a 19–30% increase in yields for different recycling numbers, which was influenced by increasing the temperature and by applying catalysts. The heterogeneous catalyst showed a considerable increase (17.8%) in yield, a decrease (9.5%) in nitrogen content, and an improved energy consumption recovery by 30.8% after single recycling. However, a slight increase (2.7%) in nitrogen content was observed after recycling twice. It is vital to reduce the amount of energy used in the hydrothermal liquefaction process to be comparable with conventional fuels. Recycling the aqueous phase reduced the energy usage considerably. Applying the homogeneous catalyst and recycling the aqueous phase twice had the highest energy efficiency (36.8%) and production yield (51.4%) for the hydrothermal liquefaction process. The generated aqueous phase in single and double recycling experiments had up to 77% and 166% more phosphate, which may be of interest for agricultural applications. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An experimental study was performed to explore the effect of pilot and main injection strategy on injection interactions and the spray characteristics of biodiesels that were derived from different feedstocks. Biodiesel considered in this investigation ranged from rapeseed methyl ester, sunflower oil methyl ester, coconut oil methyl ester, waste cooking methyl ester, and tallow methyl ester. The sprays of these biodiesel were characterized through the measurement of macroscopic parameters such as spray penetration, spray angle and spray area, which were compared against ULSD for both pilot and main injection. This investigation was performed in a constant volume chamber maintained under non-reactive conditions. The magnitude of cone angle and spray area for most biodiesel were lower than ULSD. Conversely, the spray tip penetrations for most biodiesels were higher than ULSD. The main injection showed relatively larger magnitude for all macroscopic spray parameters than those of pilot injection. Expulsion of liquid was observed in the dwell period between pilot and main injection as well as end of main injection for all fuels. The end-of-injection expulsions are mainly due to injector needle dynamics rather than variation in physical properties of fuels. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work focusses on a novel technique of producing bioethanol from fermented pomegranate fruits waste by using Saccharomyces cerevisiae, commonly known as baker's yeast. Four different blends of bioethanol, namely PE10, PE15, PE20, and PE25 were experimented at various operating speeds. It was inferred that the addition of ethanol enhanced the consumption of fuel as well as braking capacity. However, thermal performance was observed to be declined. PE15 blend exhibited optimum brake thermal efficiency at full load condition when compared with unleaded fuel. Brake specific fuel consumption of PE15 was noticed to be lower at different operating speeds among all the blends. Oxides of nitrogen as well as carbon dioxide emissions were increased as the proportion of ethanol in pure fuel was increased. Hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions were reduced, while increasing the ratio of ethanol relative to pure gasoline, except PE10 blend. The combustion characteristics were also studied. Lower value of coefficient of variation revealed stable combustion. This study conclude that PE15 can be used as an alternative fuel.

AB  - The use of novel algae-derived activated carbon supported NiMo carbide catalysts for upgrading algal biocrude oil by hydrodeoxygenation was investigated. The carbide catalysts were prepared in a two-step process involving sequential impregnation or co-impregnation of NiMo on activated carbon and followed by carbonization through three different methods namely temperature-programmed reaction with 20%CH4-80%H2, carbothermal hydrogen reduction in H2, and carbothermal reduction in N2. The synthesized carbide catalysts were characterized using XRD, BET, TPD-NH3, TGA, and XPS techniques. The catalysts were screened for hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of algal biocrude at various process conditions in a stirred tank reactor to produce liquid hydrocarbon fuels. The liquid hydrocarbon product was analyzed by 1HNMR, 13CNMR, Sim-dist, CHNS, and GC–MS to gain insight into algal biofuel properties. The NiMo carbide synthesized through co-impregnation and carbothermal reduction in N2 showed optimal activity for oxygen removal due to its high acidity and specific surface area and a greater amount of Mo2C as active phases on the surface. Response surface methodology was applied for NiMoC catalyst to optimize the effects of temperature (350–450 °C), catalyst loadings (5–15 wt%), and reaction time (1.5–4 h) at a constant pressure of 3 MPa. The upgraded biocrude oil revealed an oxygen reduction percentage of 94% with HHV of 43.9 MJ/kg. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A magnetized zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8) impregnated with sodium hydroxide catalyst has been synthesized and tested as a new catalyst for biodiesel production. The new catalyst was investigated for the ethanolysis of vegetable oil to produce biodiesel. The operating conditions of the biodiesel production were optimized using the 2n design method followed by a reduced number of experimental runs. A 70% conversion of oil in the ethanolysis reaction was achieved using the new catalyst. The optimized operating conditions were found to be alcohol to oil molar ratio of 21:1, catalyst loading of 1% wt., a reaction time of 90 min, and temperature of 75 °C. Ethanolysis reaction was found to obey the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. In addition, the Arrhenius pre-exponential constant and activation energy were calculated to be 1.12 × 1010 L mol−1.min−1 and 77.27 kJ/mol, respectively. The physical properties of the product biodiesel matched the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) ranges. Additionally, the product biodiesel achieved a Cetane number of 75, which is 15% higher than the upper range of the ASTM. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The development of biofuels as an alternative to the use of fossil fuels is growing worldwide due to environmental concerns and energy independence; thus, considerable technical progress has been achieved in biofuel production. Microalgae have been widely used for nutrient removal during wastewater treatment and produce compounds that can be used as feedstock for biofuel synthesis. In this work, the green microalga Coelastrum sp. was cultivated using industrial wastes: molasses as the carbon source and synthetic wastewater as the culture medium to determine the potential of its use for biofuel production. The use of synthetic wastewater (SWW) and molasses improved biomass production when compared with cultures carried out in a standard laboratory culture medium, such as tris-acetate-phosphate (TAP). Growth rates of 0.31 and 1.4 day−1 were attained during exponential growth rate with SWW and molasses and TAP media, respectively. The best results in biomass and lipid content, 2.29 ± 0.05 and 0.71 ± 0.03 g L−1, were obtained after 15 days of culture in SWW with molasses. The analysis of the lipid profile, produced by Coelastrum sp. cultured under these conditions, determined that the microalga can be considered as a high-quality feedstock for producing green diesel, bio-jet fuel, or biodiesel. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In the present work, Hexanol a biofuel produced from agro-waste is examined as a potential alternative to fossil fuel. A single-cylinder water-cooled Diesel engine was used for the tests. The mechanical injector was replaced with a solenoid injector and provisions were made for mounting an injector in the inlet port. Diesel was injected in-cylinder during the late compression stroke and hexanol was injected into the inlet port of the engine. The engine was operated at rated load and the ratio of hexanol to Diesel was varied. The tests were carried out at injection pressures (Pinj) of 400, 500, and 600 bar. Combustion and emission data were collected and compared to that of neat Diesel combustion. Increased peak pressure and heat release rates were observed. Oxides of nitrogen together with smoke emissions decreased, with an increasing percentage of hexanol at each Pinj. There was a marginal increase in indicated thermal efficiency even though the heating value of hexanol is lower. This study suggests hexanol could be utilized as an alternative fuel in advanced reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI) combustion. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Second-generation biofuel crop miscanthus is one of the most promising plants tested for phytomanagement of contaminated sites. In this preliminary pot case study, the most used hybrid Miscanthus x giganteus was cultivated in three different real contaminated soils: agricultural soil contaminated with Cd; post-military soil slightly contaminated with Zn, Pb and Cd; and soil contaminated by petroleum industry with metals and hydrocarbons. The stress response of plants and soil microbial communities was monitored to receive data that are important for successful phytomanagement application. With metals only, the plant grew well, and chlorophyll fluorescence measurement proved their good vitality. Changes in leaf anatomy (leaf thickness and sclerenchyma cells area) were additionally determined in post-military soil compared to agricultural. On the contrary, in petroleum-contaminated soil, the biomass yield was too reduced and also physiological parameters were significantly decreased. The response of microbial communities also differed. In agricultural soil, no microbial stress was determined. In post-military soil, it became reduced during the experiment, and in petroleum contamination, it increased year-on-year. It could be concluded that miscanthus is suitable for cultivation in metals contaminated soils with potential for microbial communities support, but in soil contaminated by the petroleum industry, its application did not seem meaningful. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Due to looming demand for fossil fuels and environmental concerns over global warming, extensive attention has been given on the development of renewable energy. Biomass materials are used since millennia for meeting myriad human needs including energy and chemicals. In this study, co-pyrolysis characteristics of woody and grass type agricultural wastes, namely Borassus flabellifer and Cymbopogon flexuosus were studied in a fixed bed reactor to evaluate their potential use as source of bio-oil. The effects of operating parameters such as temperature, particle size and heating rate were investigated. In this co-pyrolysis process, the maximum yield of pyrolysis bio-oil 47.10 wt% can been obtained under the pyrolysis temperature of 500ºC, 1.0 mm particle size and at the heating rate of 30 ºC/min. The bio-oil product was analyzed for physical, elemental and chemical composition using Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy and gas chromatography (GC). © 2021 Scientific Publishers.

AB  - Biofuels are receiving increased scientific attention, and recently different biofuels have been proposed for spark ignition engines. This paper presents the state of art of using biofuels in spark ignition engines (SIE). Different biofuels, mainly ethanol, methanol, i-butanol-n-butanol, and acetone, are blended together in single dual issues and evaluated as renewables for SIE. The biofuels were compared with each other as well as with the fossil fuel in SIE. Future biofuels for SIE are highlighted. A proposed method to reduce automobile emissions and reformulate the emissions into new fuels is presented and discussed. The benefits and weaknesses of using biofuels in SIE are summarized. The study established that ethanol has several benefits as a biofuel for SIE; it enhanced engine performance and decreased pollutant emissions significantly; however, ethanol showed some drawbacks, which cause problems in cold starting conditions and, additionally, the engine may suffer from a vapor lock situation. Methanol also showed improvements in engine emissions/performance similarly to ethanol, but it is poisonous biofuel and it has some sort of incompatibility with engine materials/systems; its being miscible with water is another disadvantage. The lowest engine performance was displayed by n-butanol and i-butanol biofuels, and they also showed the greatest amount of unburned hydrocarbons (UHC) and CO emissions, but the lowest greenhouse effect. Ethanol and methanol introduced the highest engine performance, but they also showed the greatest CO2 emissions. Acetone introduced a moderate engine performance and the best/lowest CO and UHC emissions. Single biofuel blends are also compared with dual ones, and the results showed the benefits of the dual ones. The study concluded that the next generation of biofuels is expected to be dual blended biofuels. Different dual biofuel blends are also compared with each other, and the results showed that the ethanol–methanol (EM) biofuel is superior in comparison with n-butanol–i-butanol (niB) and i-butanol–ethanol (iBE). © 2021 by the author.

AB  - Due to the damaging environmental impacts resulting from direct entry of mineral lubricants into the environment, the use of bio-lubricants as a sustainable and renewable alternative to mineral lubricants is necessary; therefore, bio-based lubricants play an important role in overcoming existing challenges and reducing energy consumption. The present research has been conducted to intensity the production process of TMPTE (trimethylolpropane triester) from rapeseed methyl ester under the influence of ultrasonic irradiation. Ultrasound irradiation is one of the efficient and new methods to intensify the TMPTE production reaction. Ultrasound significantly intensifies the overall process with reduction in energy consumption. The response surface methodology was used for the multi-objective optimization of the process input variables in order to obtain the highest yield with the lowest energy consumption. The optimized results of this experiment reveal that with the amplitude of 82%, cycle of 40%, and reaction time of 60 min a bio-lubricant yield of 82.21% with an energy consumption of 116.7 kJ is obtained. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A novel approach using Bayesian simulations coupled with scenario modelling to assess the outcomes on pollutant emissions through implementation of maritime energy strategies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd
With increasingly stringent regulations on emission criteria and environment pollution concerns, marine fuel oils (particularly heavy fuel oils) that are commonly used today for powering ships will no longer be allowed in the future. Various maritime energy strategies are now needed for the long-term upgrade that might span decades, and quantitative predictions are necessary to assess the outcomes of their implementation for decision support purpose. To address the technical need, a novel approach is developed in this study that can incorporate the strategic implementation of fuel choices and quantify their adequacy in meeting future environmental pollution legislations for ship emissions. The core algorithm in this approach is based on probabilistic simulations with a large sample size of ship movement in the designated port area, derived using a Bayesian ship traffic generator from existing real activity data. Its usefulness with scenario modelling is demonstrated with application examples at five major ports, namely the Ports of Shanghai, Singapore, Tokyo, Long Beach, and Hamburg, for assessment at Years 2020, 2030, and 2050 with three economic scenarios. The included fuel choices in the application examples are comprehensive, including heavy fuel oils, distillates, low sulphur fuel oils, ultra-low sulphur fuel oils, liquefied natural gas, hydrogen, biofuel, methanol, and electricity (battery). Various features are fine-tuned to reflect micro-level changes on the fuel choices, terminal location, and/or ship technology. Future atmospheric pollutant emissions with various maritime energy strategies implemented at these ports are then discussed comprehensively in details to demonstrate the usefulness of the approach. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present study, sunflower and soybean oil commixture with 50:50 V/V % had been used to produce biodiesel by using a homogeneously catalyzed transesterification. The influence of biodiesel blend, nano blended fuel, and nanoemulsion fuel blends on the combustion, performance, as well as emissions of DI diesel engine, had been examined in the laboratory at various engine loads and a steady speed of 1400 rpm. Volumetric proportions of fuel mixtures: D50B50N000 (50% diesel-50% biodiesel), D50B50N200 (D50B50 + 200 ppm silver thiocyanate AgSCN (SCP1∖), D50B50N200 + 2% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and D50B50N200 + 4%H2O2 were arranged to fuelling a one-cylinder engine. The exhaust emissions of the engine were compared at pure diesel fuel and biodiesel blend D50B50N000, which indicated a reduction in CO, UHC, and NOx emissions upon adding a 200-ppm of silver thiocyanate SCP1∖ as a nano additive. This reduction increased upon adding and increasing the volumetric percentage of H2O2 where the D50B50N200 + 4% H2O2 fuel blend has lower emission values. The results show that CO2 emissions for the investigated fuel blends were elevated than diesel fuel. The presence of nanosized AgSCN and H2O2 enhanced the combustion process because of elevated nanoparticle surface/volume ratio and the occurrence of micro-explosion phenomena of the sprayed fuel particles, which increased the in-cylinder pressure and heat release rate (HRR). A noticeable decrease in brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) was observed owing to the positive effect of using nano biodiesel blend and nanoemulsion fuels. A consequent increment in brake thermal efficiency (BTE) was indicated for nano biodiesel blend and nanoemulsion biodiesel blend fuels, where D50B50N200 + 4%H2O2 has the highest BTE of 27.16% compared to all tested fuels. Exhaust gas temperature (EGT) values were evaluated and analyzed for all tested fuels. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The use of agricultural residues for bioethanol production greatly depends on availability of raw materials and the proper design of a flexible multi-feedstock facility. Therefore, this article assesses the economic, environmental, and social feasibility of a bioethanol production plant, using multiple coffee crops residues (stems, pulp, and mucilage). A case study was designed for the Colombian context, considering three scenarios for different capacity plant. Results suggest that the production costs of 0.504, 0.508, and 0.515 $USD/l for large, medium and small capacity, respectively, are comparable to the bioethanol market price and are similar to other studies reported in the literature. The CO2 emissions obtained were 1.296 Kg CO2/l, 1.297 Kg CO2/l and 1.3 Kg CO2/l for the large, medium, and small plants respectively. The large plant requires 1,170 million tons per year of fresh water, and generates a gray water footprint of 119 thousand tons per year. However, without recirculation, 2.87 times more water is required. Favorable results were identified in terms of reduction of collateral environmental effects, as well as positive impacts on social aspects. Finally, a sensitivity analysis shows the impacts of key parameters on economic, social, and environmental merits of producing bioethanol from coffee residues. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The biofuels identified as the most appropriate for use in existing internal combustion engines are bioethanol (for Otto engines) and biodiesel (for diesel engines). Supply of these fuels requires planting energy crops with high yield and photosynthetic efficiency in large tracts of land. The two most efficient crops are sugarcane (for bioethanol) and palm oil (for biodiesel), both of which have high energy densities and the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions if produced in sufficient quantities. This study seeks to show the economic, social and environmental advantages of palm cultivation in relation to others oilseeds. It also describes a pioneering project using palm oil biodiesel blend (B20: 20% biodiesel with fossil diesel) in railway locomotives used for ore transport. The B20 blend performed satisfactorily and promoted a significant change in the company's fuel mix. It was found that there is a strong ecological appeal in the production of palm oil because of its low environmental impact, high energy balance density and high carbon sequestration by the trees. Besides, it was identified that bio-fuels can significantly replace liquid fossil fuels, the ethanol can be produced from cellulosic biomass, there are advantages of palm cultivation is relation to other oil seeds are demonstrated and the development of this segment in Brazil are guided by the National Biodiesel Production Plan (PNPB). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Green public procurement can play an important role in reducing the environmental impact of societies. While its uptake is continuously growing, barriers to its use still remain. One barrier previously identified in literature is related to the lack of accessible and easy to use tools that help standardize the development of criteria in green tenders. In this paper, to help overcome this barrier, a method is presented that can be used to develop green public procurement tools that follow previous studies recommendations about including life-cycle assessment-based data and basing procurement criteria on national environmental objectives. The method was then applied to develop a procurement tool for green procurement of public transport services in Sweden based on the Swedish environmental quality objectives. Results from the assessment of 18 pre-defined fuel systems are shown together with an illustrative example of how the tool can be used in the process leading up to procurements to set relevant criteria and during the procurement to adjust incoming tender prices. The results showed that waste-based biomethane and hydrogenated vegetable oil systems were well aligned with the Swedish environmental quality objectives due to being able to contribute positively to several objectives. Crop-based biofuels, on the other hand, performed worse due to negative effects from agricultural practices. The performance of the electric vehicle systems depended in large on how the electricity was generated, where renewable sources and low carbon sources performed better than non-renewable alternatives. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - The use of new vehicle technologies such as fuel cell hybrid electric and fully electric powertrains for biomass feedstock supply is an unexplored solution to reducing biofuel production cost, greenhouse gas emissions, and health impacts. These technologies have found success in light-duty vehicle applications and are in development for heavy-duty trucks. This study presents the first detailed stochastic techno-economic analysis and life-cycle assessment of biomass feedstock supply systems with diesel, fuel cell hybrid electric, and fully electric trucks and determines their impacts on biofuel production considering butanol as a representative biofuel. This study finds that fuel cell hybrid electric and fully electric trucks consume less energy relative to the diesel-powered truck regardless of the evaluated circumstances, including payloads of truck (loaded and empty), pavement types (gravel and paved), road conditions (normal and damaged), and road networks (local and highways). The use of fuel cell hybrid and fully electric trucks powered by H2-fuel and renewable sources of electricity, respectively, results in a large reduction in cost and carbon footprint, specifically for a long-distance hauling, and minimize other economic and environmental impacts. While the economic advantage of fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle is dependent on the price of H2-fuel and road conditions, use reduces the GHG emissions of biobutanol per 100 km-trucking-distance by 0.98–10.9 gCO2e/MJ. Results show that converting to fully electric truck transport decreases the biobutanol production cost and GHG emissions per 100 km-trucking-distance by 0.4–7.3 cents/L and 0.78 to 9.1 gCO2e/MJ, respectively. This study establishes the foundation for future investigations that will guide the development of economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable biomass feedstock supply system for cellulosic biorefineries or other goods transportation systems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The extensive usage of petroleum products in the power sector, industries, and transportation may lead to the depletion of fossil resources. Also, the most important human challenges of the 21st century are global warming and climate changes due to increased pollution levels. Nowadays, the need for new energy sources is one of the foremost problems of all countries in the world. The current experimental work is primarily focusing on the exploration of neat tamarind seed methyl ester (TSME) as a sustainable energy source for diesel engines. All the physicochemical properties were determined experimentally with concern to ASTM standards and compared with diesel fuel. Initially, tests were performed on a diesel engine with diesel and neat tamarind biodiesel in standard operating conditions 23º CA bTDC. Later, the injection timing was varied like 19º CA bTDC and 27º CA bTDC for the neat tamarind biofuel. A test result found with TSME biofuel that enhancement in brake thermal efficiency (BTE) by 4.07% was achieved with the retardation of engine injection timing when compared to standard injection timing. Also, it was found that drastic reduction of exhaust emissions by 9.7%of CO, 15.8% of HC and 6% of SO have resulted in the retarded injection timing of TSME when compared to standard conditions of TSME at full load. However, the oxides of nitrogen emissions were increased. To control the oxides of nitrogen emissions, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) at two levels such as 10% and 20% were used when the engine was operated at retarded injection timing (IT) with TSME. It was found that TSME with 10% EGR inferred a drastic reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions by 30% and 37.7% over diesel and TSME, respectively, at full load. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The production of biofuel from biomass is a viable option, due to the availability of biomass and its renewable character. This work aims to explore the production of bio-jet fuel via different routes in the context of a biorefinery in which the production of the bio-jet fuel is integrated with a palm oil mill and a transesterification plant for the production of biodiesel. In addition to handling the extraction and transesterification phases, the system has also a second-generation ethanol plant and facilities for the production of bio-jet fuel via HEFA and ATJ. The biorefinery has a cogeneration plant that is responsible for supplying all the processes with thermal and electric energy. The system is evaluated using the first and second laws of thermodynamics, and is shown to have efficiencies of 37% and 55%, respectively. An exergoeconomic and economic analysis is also carried out in this study. The thermodynamic analysis highlights the immature character of the bio-jet fuel production chain, due to the irreversibilities, in the HEFA scenario, 47 MW, and in the for the combination of 2G-ethanol and ATJ plants, 82 MW. In the ATJ process, the highest thermoeconomic costs were found for the biofuels. However, although the surplus of electricity produced had a higher cost than for any other product, at 65.53 US$/MWh, this was within the margins of market competitiveness in Brazil. The economic analysis showed that the project was not attractive due to the high initial investment required. From an environmental standpoint, the production of bio-jet fuel is an alternative that can mitigate the effects of global warming compared to fossil jet fuel, with reductions in emissions of 84.7% and 72.8% for HEFA and ATJ bio-jet fuels, respectively. In summary, it is shown that although diversification of the biorefinery’s products can contribute to the finances of the plant, the production chains are not fully prepared, and the processes of bio-jet acquisition has low production yields and a high level of irreversibility.

AB  - Developing biomass-based strategies for liquid bio-fuels production is promising for the reduction of the aftereffects of fossil fuels. The conversion of lignin-derived intermediates such as cyclohexanone is currently of a great deal of interest. The current study aims to evaluate the molybdenum-based hydrotreating catalysts for the conversion of cyclohexanone in the presence of hydrogen. Catalytic experiments at 400 °C, 15 bar, and a range of WHSV were developed. The experiments reveal that catalyst type and reaction WHSV affect the cyclohexanone conversion, product distribution, deoxygenation efficiency, total hydrocarbon production capacity, and heating value of the product blend. The main products include C6 cyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons and oxygenates. Cyclohexane, cyclohexene, benzene, cyclohexanol, and phenol are major products. Small quantities of methylcyclopentane and bicyclic hydrocarbons and oxygenates are also reported in some cases. Increasing WHSV reduced the cyclohexanone conversion. Cyclohexanone conversions up to 89% were observed at the lowest WHSVs over a cobalt-molybdenum sample. The highest hydrocarbon production capacity (99.53%) was managed at WHSV = 5.240 gcyclohexanone/gcat h over a cobalt-molybdenum sample, while the highest deoxygenation efficiency, i.e. 81.29% degree of deoxygenation and 5.35 C/O ratio enhancement were achieved at WHSV = 0.262 gcyclohexanone/gcat h by a nickel-molybdenum sample. The heating values would be enhanced by up to 22.7% when cyclohexanone is converted over the utilized catalysts. The larger heating value (44.90 MJ/kg, 22.7% enhancement) was obtained over a nickel-molybdenum catalyst, which is comparable to the energy density of the conventional fuels. The results reveal that the catalysts are efficient in the conversion of cyclohexanone to liquid bio-fuels.

AB  - Hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), a glycerol-derived biofuel (blended with diesel fuel at 20% v/v, Mo·bio®) and biodiesel produced through the esterification of residual free fatty acids from the palm oil industry (pure and blended with diesel fuel at 20% v/v), all of them considered as advanced biofuels as defined in the Directive EU/2018/2001, were tested in a Euro 6 diesel vehicle equipped with ammonia-SCR. Tests were carried out in a chassis dyno at warm (24°C) and cold (−7°C) ambient conditions following the Worldwide harmonized Light-duty vehicles Test Cycle (WLTC). The efficiency of the SCR when changing the fuel was also analysed. Regarding vehicle performance, fuel properties were mainly relevant at warm conditions. Because of the lower EGR rate, NOx emissions upstream of the SCR were higher at cold temperature, mainly during the low and the extra-high speed phases of the WLTC. CO and THC emissions were only important at the beginning of the cycle and at −7°C. HVO presented advantages regarding these compounds, while the worse cloud point of biodiesel led to higher emissions. As expected, engine-out NOx emissions were very sensitive to the EGR rate, HVO showing a slightly better behaviour because of its high cetane number. The SCR efficiency was mainly affected by the exhaust gas temperature, although fuel-derived effects were also significant. In fact, a more appropriate NO2/NOx ratio at the catalyst inlet for HVO and a higher hydrocarbon concentration at the low-speed phase for B20 contributed to a lower tail-pipe NOx emissions at −7°C. The oxygen content of biodiesel-based fuels (B100 and B20) led to lower particle number with respect to diesel fuel. Despite its nil aromatic content, the higher EGR rate and the extremely superior autoignition trend of HVO led to higher particle number under high engine load and warm conditions. © IMechE 2021.

AB  - We develop a superstructure framework for the design of biorefineries for ethanol upgrading into advanced biofuels to replace gasoline, jet fuel or diesel. The framework integrates catalysis, process synthesis, and fuel property modelling towards the design of biorefineries producing fuels with specified properties. The proposed framework is applied to identify strategies for the upgrading of ethanol into one or more fuels with specific properties. We discuss the trade-off between profit and biorefinery complexity, as well as the relation among fuel property constraints, the optimal upgrading strategy selected, and process economics. Finally, we show how to find the optimal biorefinery associated with a particular chemistry or catalyst. The results presented constitute the first systematic study of ethanol upgrading considering, simultaneously, fuel and process design. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Microalgae are a large group of phototrophic microorganisms that convert CO2 into biomass, which can be used as an important source of biofuels. Biofuels have a lot of interesting applications in various industries. The main objective of the current study was to assess the biomass and lipid production, gene expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (accD) and ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase large-chain (rbcL), and the lipid content produced by myo-inositol treatment in the microalga Chlorella vulgaris. Three different myo-inositol concentrations (i.e., 50, 100, and 200 mg/L) were added to the algal growth media, and the algal cells were sampled on the day of entering the stationary phase of the growth cycle. Biomass production was increased by increasing the supplement. However, the 200 mg/L concentration of myo-inositol was critical for lipid production. To evaluate the effect of the vitamin on the expression of the accD and rbcL genes, real-time PCR was used. The rbcL gene expression increased in relation to biomass production, i.e., 224.08 times higher than the control. On the other hand, the accD expression at 200 mg/L myo-inositol concentration, as physiological stress, increased, i.e., 95.2 times higher than the control. Therefore, this growth complement can induce biomass and lipid production. Findings of the present study provide valuable insight into determining the biochemical modulation strategies of biomass and lipid production. In this study, two separate controlling systems and two independent promoters were proposed to regulate the transcription of rbcL and accD genes induced by various concentrations of myo-inositol. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In the past decades, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions have become an important issue for many researchers and policy makers. The focus of scientists and experts in the area is mainly on lowering the CO2 emission levels. In this article, panel data is analyzed with an econometric model, to estimate the impact of renewable energy, biofuels, bioenergy efficiency, population, and urbanization level on CO2 emissions in European Union (EU) countries. Our results underline the fact that urbanization level has a negative impact on increasing CO2 emissions, while biofuels, bioenergy production, and renewable energy consumption have positive and direct impacts on reducing CO2 emissions. Moreover, population growth and urbanization level are negatively correlated with CO2 emission levels. The authors’ findings suggest that the public policies at the national level must encourage the consumption of renewable energy and biofuels in the EU, while population and urbanization level should come along with more restrictions on CO2 emissions. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Dibutyl ether (DBE) is a promising biofuel due to its high cetane number (~ 100) and high volumetric energy density (31.6 MJ/L). It could either be used directly in compression ignition engines or blended with other conventional or renewable fuels. Oxidation and pyrolysis kinetics of DBE are not well known, particularly at high pressures. In this work, we have experimentally investigated the chemical kinetics of DBE in three domains: (a) ignition delay time measurements in a rapid compression machine over T = 550–650 K, P = 10, 20, 40 bar, ϕ = 0.5, 1; (b) ignition delay time measurements in a shock tube over T = 900–1300 K, P = 20, 40 bar, ϕ = 0.5, 1; (c) laser-based carbon monoxide speciation measurements in a shock tube during DBE pyrolysis and oxidation over T = 1100–1400 K, P = 20 bar. Pressure time-histories measured in RCM experiments exhibited unique 3-stage and 4-stage ignition behavior predominantly at fuel-lean conditions. Experimental data were compared with the predictions of two recent chemical kinetic models of DBE. Sensitivity analyses were carried out to identify key reactions which may have caused the discrepancy between experiments and simulations. It was found that the rate of decomposition of DBE may need to be revisited to improve the oxidative and pyrolytic predictions of DBE kinetic model. © 2020

AB  - The increase in energy demand, especially in Jordan, has encouraged researchers to consider alternative sources of energy, such as biofuel production from agricultural waste. For this study, Jordanian corn leaf waste was characterized by ultimate and proximate analysis, TGA, FTIR and solid state 13C NMR. The waste showed high volatile matter, high atomic H/C ratio and high O content. The corn leaf waste contained 32.1 wt% cellulose, 18.1 wt% hemicelluloses and 11.9 wt% lignin. The FTIR and 13C NMR spectrums showed high concentrations of aliphatic and carbonyl carbon. The corn leaf waste was pyrolysed in a temperature range of 300–450 °C under a constant flow rate of nitrogen. Higher oil yield was obtained at pyrolysis temperature of 450 °C. The gas yield and higher heating value of the product increased as the temperature increased, whereas the water content decreased. The biofuels were rich in carbon and had a high oxygen content, which decreased as the temperature increased. The 1H NMR confirmed the markedly aliphatic character of the biofuel. The GC-MS for the biofuel indicated the presence of hydrocarbon series, large amounts of oxygenated compounds and a few nitrogen and sulfur compounds. The simulated distillation showed a high proportion of diesel fraction (57–73%). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the face of lacking an equation to predict important characteristics of new biofuels, thirty mixing rules originally developed to calculate the viscosity of petroleum and its fractions were tested, using 303 experimental data of biodiesel and petrodiesel binary blends from literature, covering a variety of vegetal oils and types of petrodiesel. The initial criterion used to evaluate the accuracy of mixing rules to predict viscosity of blends was relative standard error (RSE). Seven of the thirty rules exhibited RSE higher than 25%, and only nine exhibited relative standard error lower than 5% (e.g., excellent agreement between observed and estimated values). For these nine rules, further statistical analyses were applied to strengthen the evaluation. The results revealed that the Lederer equation exhibited the best performance to predict viscosity of binary blends of biodiesel with petrodiesel, with estimation error below 4.29% and residual balance (-7) indicating no tendency of over- or under-estimate values. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Vegetable oils are usually not used directly in diesel engines due to their high viscosity. In this study, biodiesel was produced from flaxseed oil by transesterification at 60 °C. The process variables–methanol concentration (as methanol:oil molar ratio), catalyst concentration (KOH % wt/wt of oil) and reaction time–were used to analyze the process on the basis of methyl ester yield and kinematic viscosity. The reaction with catalyst concentration 1%, reaction time 45 minutes and methanol:oil molar ratio 6:1 had the highest methyl ester yield, of 94%. The kinematic viscosity decreased from 24.2 to 3.54 cSt following the reaction, producing a suitable value within the standard limits. Fuel properties of the flaxseed methyl ester, such as American Petroleum Institute (API) gravity, flash point, calorific value, acid number and carbon residue, were measured and found to be within the standard limits. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Plant-based biofuels are globally accepted renewable alternatives to fossil fuels. Both biodiesel and bioethanol can be derived from various plant-based feedstocks using conventional and advanced conversion technologies. However, the use of conventional first-generation plant feedstocks creates a ‘food versus fuel’ conflict through competition with agriculture for arable land and freshwater resources. In this regard, succulent, latex-yielding species of Euphorbia (Euphorbiaceae) have advantages as feedstock for liquid biofuel production. These include high levels of primary productivity, a remarkable ability to grow on marginal lands under xeric conditions, and a relatively small bioenergy freshwater footprint. In addition, yields of Euphorbia-based biofuels are relatively high, and the fuel has chemical, physical, and combustive properties that are comparable to or exceed those of fossil fuels. In this review, we summarize the status of biofuel research using Euphorbia feedstock. Harvesting and drying of biomass, extraction, characterization and refinement of biocrude, blending with diesel, fuel properties, effects on engine performance and emissions, and use of spent residues for production of bioethanol and other valuable co-products are discussed. Major challenges and future opportunities associated with Euphorbia-based biofuel development are considered. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Petroleum product has seen a drastic demand in the recent past. In this scenario it is important to come up with alternate fuels with better efficiency. This experimental study was undertaken to investigate the use of a blend of rice bran oil and ethanol with various propositions as a substitute to diesel fuel. Its performance charactertics are analysed in a diesel engine and are reported. We are also dealing with a solution to avoid gel formation in cold condition. Emission of CO and NOx is prevented by a three-way catalytic converter. Experimental investigations were carried out on a four-stroke, twin-cylinder CI diesel engine. Various blends of biodiesel (rice bran ethyl ester) and ethanol ranging from 5% to 15% in the blend were used. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Use of abundant indigenous energy crops for biofuel production contributes to enhance the economy and reduce the dependence on fossil fuels. This article aims to shed light on two energy crops available in Pakistan; castor (Ricinus communis L.) and cottonseed (Gossypium hirsutum L.). Although castor has excellent oil content (54%), its high viscosity is not acceptable. Therefore, pre-blending with cottonseed oil was proposed. Physical and chemical properties of crude oils, pure biodiesels and binary blends besides fatty acid composition and degree of unsaturation were analyzed. Biodiesels were checked for quality parameters within limits of American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) and European Standards. Improvement in kinematic viscosity and density of castor biodiesel were noticed following this concept. Moreover, the developed empirical formula indicated that an optimized blending ratio of 93.86% cottonseed oil and 6.14% castor oil accomplished biodiesel yield of 91.12%, kinematic viscosity of 6 mm2/s and cetane number of 48.79, respectively, which all satisfy ASTM D6751. This technique also indicated that pre-blending can raise the ester content of castor biodiesel. In conclusion, it is recommended to adopt the concept of pre-blending to improve the quality of biodiesel and thus the engine and emission performance in compression ignition engines. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The increasing energy demand of a rapidly growing population has rekindled the interest of humankind in the use of biomass as a source of energy. The main factors behind this resurgent interest in biofuels are the fast-depleting fossil fuel reservoirs and concerns regarding climate change. The proper choice of technology for conversion of biomass into clean-burning fuel is essential for sustained use of biomass as a source of energy. Various thermo-chemical conversion processes such as combustion, hydrogenation, liquefaction, gasification and pyrolysis have been utilized to extract various energy products from biomass. Even though pyrolysis, of all the thermo-chemical processes, is still in a preliminary stage of development, it has received special attention in our present energy scenario as it can convert biomass into various liquid, solid and gaseous products. The use of solar energy provides a renewable source for pyrolysis, which gives it an edge over use of thermal energy. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the various pyrolysis techniques and their comparative advantages and disadvantages in terms of their environmental impacts. The advantages of using solar thermal power over other pyrolysis methods are also covered in detail. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Cutaneotrichosporon oleaginosus ATCC 20509 is a fast-growing oleaginous basidiomycete yeast that is able to grow in a wide range of low-cost carbon sources including crude glycerol, a byproduct of biodiesel production. When glycerol is used as a carbon source, this yeast can accumulate more than 50% lipids (w/w) with high concentrations of mono-unsaturated fatty acids. Results: To increase our understanding of this yeast and to provide a knowledge base for further industrial use, a FAIR re-annotated genome was used to build a genome-scale, constraint-based metabolic model containing 1553 reactions involving 1373 metabolites in 11 compartments. A new description of the biomass synthesis reaction was introduced to account for massive lipid accumulation in conditions with high carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio in the media. This condition-specific biomass objective function is shown to better predict conditions with high lipid accumulation using glucose, fructose, sucrose, xylose, and glycerol as sole carbon source. Conclusion: Contributing to the economic viability of biodiesel as renewable fuel, C. oleaginosus ATCC 20509 can effectively convert crude glycerol waste streams in lipids as a potential bioenergy source. Performance simulations are essential to identify optimal production conditions and to develop and fine tune a cost-effective production process. Our model suggests ATP-citrate lyase as a possible target to further improve lipid production. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The present study defines a novel green method for the synthesis of the nickel oxide nanocatalyst by using an aqueous latex extract of the Ficus elastic. The catalyst was examined for the conversion of novel Brachychiton populneus seed oil (BPSO) into biodiesel. The Brachychiton populneus seeds have a higher oil content (41 wt%) and free fatty acid value (3.8 mg KOH/g). The synthesised green nanocatalyst was examined by the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-Ray (EDX) spectroscopy, X-Ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The obtained results show that the synthesised green nanocatalyst was 22–26 nm in diameter and spherical-cubic in shape with a higher rate of catalytic efficiency. It was utilised further for the conversion of BPSO into biofuel. Due to the high free fatty acid value, the biodiesel was synthesised by the two-step process, i.e., pretreatment of the BPSO by means of acid esterification and then followed by the transesterification reaction. The acidic catalyst (H2SO4) was used for the pretreatment of BPSO. The optimum condition for the transesterification of the pretreated BPSO was 1:9 of oil-methanol molar ratio, 2.5 wt % of prepared nanocatalyst concentration and 85 °C of reaction temperature corresponding to the highest biodiesel yield of 97.5 wt%. The synthesised biodiesel was analysed by the FT-IR and GC-MS technique to determine the chemical composition of fatty acid methyl esters. Fuel properties of Brachychiton populneus seed oil biodiesel (BPSOB) were also examined, compared, and it falls in the prescribed range of ASTM standards. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The current research work focuses on the conventional bio-catalysed synthesis of amyl levulinate with immobilized Candida antarctica lipase B in the absence of a toxic solvent. The green catalyst and solvent free system offered considerable benefits like mild and gentle condition requirement, lesser-energy demand, easy down-streaming and reusability of the biocatalyst. The process parameters were examined, and the maximum conversion (73.2 %) was obtained under the optimum condition of 50℃ temperature, 1:3 M ratio of levulinic acid to amyl alcohol using 0.8 % (w/v) biocatalyst at 250 rpm speed. The immobilized lipase was characterized by SEM, BET, XRD, FTIR and amyl levulinate was characterized by FTIR and GC–MS analysis. The enzyme lipase was effectively reused till 5 cycles for the formation of ester. The thermodynamic parameters (ΔH, ΔG, and ΔS) and energy of activation (Ea) were determined for the assessment of energy requirement. The activation energy was determined to be 48.42 kJ/mol. The research protocol strikes the development of biocatalytic synthetic route of amyl levulinate without using any toxic solvent, which may contribute to green chemistry approach. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A comparative catalytic activity study of Pt-MoOx/ZrO2 and Pt-WOx/ZrO2 for deoxygenation of oleic acid (OA) forming fuel-range, linear hydrocarbons is reported. These catalysts (with 4 wt% Pt and 8 wt% Mo or W) were prepared by a sequential wet-impregnation method and characterized for the structural and electronic properties. Pt-MoOx/ZrO2 showed higher catalytic activity than Pt-WOx/ZrO2. Hydrodeoxygenation was the selective pathway over these bifunctional catalysts yielding n-octadecane. High conversion of OA was achieved at 200 °C itself. On the contrary, monometallic Pt/ZrO2 was weakly active. It was selective mainly toward decarboxylation/decarbonylation producing n-heptadecane. Higher amounts of Pt and metal oxide in reduced forms are responsible for the high hydrodeoxygenation activity and selectivity of these reusable, bimetallic catalysts. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present experimental investigation is conducted to examine the working characteristics of compression ignition (CI) engine using oxygenated additives such as diethyl ether and ethanol to the blends of Calophyllum inophyllum biodiesel. Experiments are conducted on a water-cooled single-cylinder constant speed DI (direct injection) diesel engine under same operating circumstances. The results indicates that an enhancement of brake thermal efficiency is up to 3.7% and 6.2% with an addition of ethanol and DEE additive in biodiesel blended fuels respectively at maximum load condition. This is attributable to the existence of higher oxygen value and volatile nature of the additives. The combustion characteristics like in-cylinder pressure and net heat release rate of DEE blended fuels are 1.1–5.2% and 0.4–2.7% higher than other blends respectively. This is mainly due to higher cetane number and high volatile nature of DEE. This also results in higher NOX emissions. But 2–9% drop in nitrous oxide emission is noticed for biodiesel with ethanol blends compared to all other blends. This is as a result of superior latent heat of vaporization and lesser cetane number of ethanol which results in lower cylinder pressure about 0.4–2.6% and this end up with more unburned HC and CO emissions. Energy and exergy studies help to analyze the result of ethanol and DEE additive along with blends of biodiesel. The exergy efficiencies of DEE blended fuels enhance up to 2.3–6% compared to other blends at all load conditions. This is attributable to the superior combustion characteristics of DEE.

AB  - The energy potential of residue-derived biogas via electricity and biomethane production was assessed in an integrated 1G2G sugarcane biorefinery concept. The mono-digestion of 1G-vinasse (1G-VN) was compared with different co-digestion systems, namely, 1G-VN + filter cake (FC) + deacetylation liquor (DL) in the season and FC + DL in the off-season. Gross energy output values and the resulting sugarcane use efficiency were also assessed in different biorefinery schemes. Electricity production from 1G to VN (5.0 MW) could be increased by over 400% through its co-digestion with FC and DL (22.3 MW). Alternatively, biomethane could fully supply the diesel-powered fleet (1.8 × 106 Nm3 month−1) of a sugarcane plant processing 10 million tons of sugarcane per harvest, and the surplus biogas could flexibly provide 36 MW of extra electricity. Biomethane could enhance the energy output of 1G2G sugarcane biorefineries by 15%. However, 2G processes still require marked improvements to maximize energy production from sugarcane. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present work is intended to improve the performance of a direct injection compression-ignition engine fuelled with nanoparticle dispersed Flaxseed oil biodiesel blend (B20). The Chromium oxide (Cr2O3) nanoparticle additive with dispersant (QPAN 80) was mixed to B20 in concentrations of 50, 75, and 100 ppm. Tests were performed to assess the engine operating characteristics under varying load conditions such as 25, 50, 75, and 100% by maintaining a uniform speed of 1500 rpm. The combustion characteristics namely cylinder pressure (CP) and net heat release rate (NHRR) have greatly improved with the nanoparticle dispersed fuel than diesel-biodiesel blends. Besides, the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) has enhanced together with lower brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC). Finally, a significant decrease in emissions like carbon monoxide (CO), unburnt hydrocarbons (UHC), smoke, and nitrogen oxides (NOx) were observed. At maximum load, the CP and NHRR have improved by 18.66% and 11.61% respectively for B20Cr2O375DS1 (B20 with 75 ppm Cr2O3 and 1:1 dispersant) while the BTE has enhanced by 3.62% and the BSFC reduced by 3.53% compared to normal diesel. The reduction in CO, UHC, NOx, and smoke were found to be 14.05%, 12.93%, 6.66%, and 22.4% respectively for B20Cr2O375DS1 than conventional diesel. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - According to the regulation announced by International Air Transport Association to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, there are many attempts to produce bio-jet fuels from natural oils to replace, at least in part, the fossil fuels. However, bio-jet fuels usually suffer from poor cold flow properties. Hence, this research aimed to convert palm olein to bio-jet fuel range with high content of iso-alkanes via hydroconversion over nickel (Ni)/zeolite-based catalysts. The levels of liquid biofuels classified as bio-gasoline, bio-jet and green diesel, including the selectivity for chemical compositions were evaluated. Under 40 bar initial H2 pressure at 360 °C for 4 h, the use of Ni/NH4-Beta catalysts (Ni content = 10 wt%) provided the maximum iso-/n-alkane ratio at 1.67 with a bio-jet yield of 20.8 wt%. The schematic reaction mechanism for this process was also proposed. The incorporation of platinum (Pt) into the Ni/NH4-Beta catalysts to a Pt/(Pt + Ni) wt ratio of 0.24 increased the bio-jet yield to 28.7 wt% with iso-/n-alkane ratio of 1.02. Differential scanning calorimetry thermograms indicated that the freezing temperature (Tf) of the biofuels decreased with increasing iso-/n-alkane ratio, where the Tf of the liquid biofuels with iso-/n-alkane ratio &gt; 1.00 was not observed. For the biofuels/fossil jet fuel (Jet A-1) blends, the use of biofuels having iso-/n-alkane ratio of 1.67 could be blended with Jet A-1 up to 50/50 (v/v) and the Tf of the blended jet fuel was found at ca. −80 °C, which was lower than the limitation according to ASTM D1655-04a (−47 °C). © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, biodiesel production from waste edible oil (WEO) using MnFe2O4/graphene oxide catalyst was investigated. For this purpose, the surface characterization of the catalyst was determined using SEM, EDX/Map, XRD, VSM, BET, TGA-DTG, CO2-TPD and FTIR analyses. The catalyst could be easily removed from the reactant due to its paramagnetic property. The BET analysis showed that the MnFe2O4/GO catalyst has a significant specific surface area, which is suitable for the transesterification reaction. Also, the CO2-TPD analysis showed that the MnFe2O4/GO catalyst has two broad and strong peaks at a temperature range of 800–900 °C, which indicates strong interactions between CO2 and active sites on the catalyst surface. Moreover, the total number of basic sites on the catalyst surface was obtained 3978.6 μmol of CO2/g of the catalyst, which is a significant value. Due to the presence of high free fatty acids (2.43 wt%) in the WEO, a hydrochloric acid catalyst was used to reduce free fatty acid content before the transesterification process using the MnFe2O4/GO catalyst. The highest biodiesel yield was obtained 96.47%, which was a remarkable value compared to previous works. According to HNMR analysis, a peak was observed at 3.7 ppm, which was attributed to the methoxy group (O–CH3) on the methyl ester, indicating that biodiesel was properly produced. Then, biodiesel was blended with petro-diesel in various proportions (B25–B100) to improve its physical properties. According to the results, the physical characteristics of the biodiesel like flash point, viscosity, cloud point, density and pour point were obtained 176 °C, 5.4 mm2/s, 5 °C, −1 °C, and 882 kg/m3, respectively. Among these properties, the cloud point is not suitable and demonstrates that pure biodiesel can't be used in the engine in cold weather and should be used in combination with diesel. However, other properties were within the standard range. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The fossil fuel issues due to toxic carbon dioxide emissions and climate change have a direct link with the particulate matter that has caused severe threat to the environment. The bio-based products such as biodiesel and bio-compressed natural gas (Bio-CNG) can be less expensive and adaptable. Biofuels are increasingly being used in transportation, heat, and power development requiring the need for renewable sources of energy. This review highlights the use of dreck organic matters from aquatic environment and soil supplies for renewable energy production for human requirements, sustaining a clean and healthy environment. Dreck can be harnessed to manufacture bioenergy that would help to mitigate greenhouse gases and preserve the environment. Methane, hydrogen, ethanol, bioelectricity, algal diesel, and butanol, or other forms of fuels provide a renewable supply of bioenergy, which can be created by the biological systems. The waste-to-energy methodologies (thermal plus biochemical) for energy production via agro-residues are covered. The key focus of this study is the recent advances in the area of 'synchronous waste mitigation with energy development' techniques. This review addresses the significance of organic substances for the production of clean and renewable energy, including alternate solutions for non-renewable fuels. The needs for appropriate and renewable alternatives for fossil fuels are discussed. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Algae pyrolytic bio-oil contains a large quantity of N-containing components (NCCs), which can be processed as valuable chemicals, while the harmful gases can also be released during bio-oil upgrading. However, the characteristics of NCCs in the bio-oil, especially the composition of heavy NCCs (molecular weight ≥200 Da), have not been fully studied due to the limitation of advanced analytical methods. In this study, three kinds of algae rich in lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates were rapidly pyrolyzed (10-25 °C/s) at different temperatures (300-700 °C). The bio-oil was analyzed using a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer equipped with electrospray ionization, and the characteristics and evolution of nitrogen in heavy components were first obtained. The results indicated that the molecular weight of most heavy NCCs was distributed in the 200-400 Da range. N1-3 compounds account for over 60% in lipid and protein-rich samples, while N0 and N4 components are prominent in carbohydrate-rich samples. As temperature increases, most NCCs become more aromatic and contain less O due to the strong Maillard and deoxygenation reactions. Moreover, the heavier NCCs were promoted to form lighter compounds with more nitrogen atoms through decomposition (mainly denitrogenation and deoxygenation). Finally, some strategies to deal with the NCCs for high-quality bio-oil production were proposed. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This paper analyses the potential of renewable fuels in different propulsion systems for the maritime sector that can replace fossil fuels by 2030. First, a fuel cost analysis is performed for a range of biofuels, bio-electrofuels, electrofuels plus liquid hydrogen and electricity in 18 fuel production pathways. Next, fuel production costs are combined with different utilisation rates, propulsion cost, on-board fuel storage cost and a cost for reduced cargo space to determine the total cost of ownership for four types of ships: large ferries, general cargo, bulk carriers and container vessels using internal combustion engines, fuel cells or battery-electric propulsion systems and travelling different distances. In large ferries, the battery-electric propulsion is found at a lower cost than all fuel options except biofuels. For the other ship types, cheaper fuels (as biofuels) benefit internal combustion engines, while expensive fuels (as electrofuels) increase the competitiveness of fuel cells due to their higher efficiency. Similarly, low utilisation rates benefit internal combustion engines, while higher utilisation rates tend to support fuel cells. General cargo vessels have a similar total cost of ownership for both four-stroke internal combustion engines and fuel cells. Bulk carriers and container ships use two-stroke engines, with efficiencies closer to fuel cells, but the lowest-cost solution remains internal combustion engines, except when increasing the efficiency or reducing the investment cost of fuel cells. In almost all fuel-propulsion combinations, methanol is the lowest-cost fuel, but dimethyl ether and ammonia show only marginally higher costs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The core objective of this study is to pull back the worsened combustion, emission, and performance characteristics of a CI engine fuelled with waste tire pyrolysis oil - diesel fuel blends. Four fuels are tested in the experiments. These are (1) 100% diesel fuel, (2) 20% waste tire pyrolysis oil + 80% diesel fuel, (3) 10% pyrolysis oil and 80% diesel fuel containing 10% waste biodiesel, and finally, (4) 10% waste tire pyrolysis oil and 80% diesel fuel containing 10% waste fusel oil. The tests are performed at a constant engine speed of 2400 rpm, and varying engine loads from 3 to 12 Nm with intervals of 3 Nm. In the results, it is noticed that using of waste tire pyrolysis oil - diesel fuel blend is reducing the brake thermal efficiency down to 9.13% for waste tire pyrolysis oil - diesel fuel blends, however, this reduction is being pulled back by 7.51%, and 3.82% with the addition of waste biodiesel, and fusel oil, respectively as compared to that of diesel fuel. On the other hand, waste tire pyrolysis oil - diesel fuel blend increased the brake specific fuel consumption by 21.78%, however, this increase is being pulled back by 8.89%, and 12.57% for waste biodiesel, and fusel oil, respectively. The increase in carbon monoxide for waste tire pyrolysis oil-diesel fuel is 7.09% in comparison with that of diesel fuel. However, with the addition of biofuels, carbon monoxide is being dropped by 7.69% for waste biodiesel, and 19.23% for fusel oil due to the high oxygen contents of waste biofuels. Moreover, waste tire pyrolysis oil-diesel fuel blend is increasing nitrogen oxide by 7.09%, but this increase by 4.64% with the addition of waste biodiesel. On the other hand, the addition of fusel oil is converting the increasing trend of nitrogen oxide into a reduction of 3.09% owing to fusel oil's water content. As a consequence, this research is proving that the waste biofuels are able to improve poor combustion, emission, and performance characteristics of binary waste tire pyrolysis oil – diesel blend with the doping of waste biofuels, and suggesting ternary blends rather than waste tire pyrolysis oil alone for diesel engines. Moreover, it is noticed that burning waste products is a very effective tool for both waste management and alternate to fossil fuels. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Calcium oxide is one of the most promising heterogeneous catalysts for biodiesel production. However, an inherent drawback of CaO is the leaching of active species into the reaction solution with the degraded reusability. To strengthen the stability, different supports are composited with the SrO–CaO oxide through the hydrothermal method and mass ratio of SrO to CaO are optimized to get the best outcome of the catalyst. Meanwhile, various characterization methods, including TG, XRD, SEM-EDX, CO2-TPD, XPS, ATR-FTIR and ICP-AES, are used to explore the physicochemical properties of catalysts. The 0.4-SrO-CaO-Al2O3 catalyst shows the best catalytic capability in transesterification of palm oil with methanol to produce biodiesel, where the FAME yield of 98.16% is achieved with the molar ratio of methanol to oil of 18:1 and catalyst concentration of 7.5 wt% at 65 °C for 3 h. Besides, ascribed to the greatly reduced leaching out of the active species, this catalyst presents the satisfying reusability and the FAME yield is slightly decreased to 92.61% for the fifth reused cycle. Therefore, this modification method for SrO–CaO–Al2O3 is feasible for enhancing the catalytic stability in transesterification. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study was carried out to investigate biodiesel production via transesterification of sunflower oil employing heterogeneous catalyst derived from indigenous ginger (Zingiber Officinale) leaves. It also aims to compare the techno-economy performance of the ginger-based catalysts in 3 different forms viz. calcinated (CGL), activated by KOH (KGL) and NaOH (NGL). The plant-based catalysts were characterised by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The parametric effects on the biodiesel production such as reaction time, methanol to oil ratio and catalyst loading were investigated. The experimental result shows that 1.6 wt % catalyst, 6:1 M ratio of alcohol to oil, 1 h 30 min of reaction time with a speed of 200 rpm gave the best results. It was found that the KGL obtained highest biodiesel yield of 93.83% under optimum conditions. Subsequently, the specific energy and energy productivity of KGL catalyst was found to be 1.2728, 26.1544 MJ/kg and 0.0382 kg/MJ, respectively, per 1 L of biodiesel. Meanwhile, the renewable energy to non-renewable energy ratio for CGL, KGL and NGL is found to be 3.17, 4.01 and 3.67, respectively. A higher sustainable renewable energy-yield ratio and overall economical profit cost ratio are preferable for the biodiesel production process. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel, as a green fuel, acts as a potential candidate to supplement conventional fossil fuels. This research study targets green environment (using biodiesel) and clean environment (reduce wastewater) by producing biodiesel through oleaginous biomasses (Yarrowia lipolytica, Metschnikowia pulcherrima and Lipomyces starkeyi) grown on pulp and paper industrial wastewater. Batch culture studies were explored for the potential feedstock of the oleaginous organism by the synthesis of single cell oil and fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to design the optimal experimental matrix and identify the optimal process conditions that enhance the FAME yield. To determine the inherent characteristics of the growth of oleaginous biomasses on the industrial wastewater, a data-driven adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is implemented. Y. lipolytica strain cultured shown high biomass concentration of 32.36 g/l with biomass productivity of 5.39 g/l/d was considered for further scale-up for the transesterification process. Results indicated that the maximum yield of 0.48 (g-biodiesel/g-lipid) was obtained under the 2.5 g of lipid dosage with 0.02 g/ml of catalyst concentration by constant stirring at 70 °C. The optimum conditions to achieve maximum FAME yield of 1.154 g/g was obtained at 2.485 g, 70.87 °C and 0.021 g/ml for lipid dosage, temperature and catalyst concentrations, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The conversion of high acid value (AV) waste cooking oils (WCOs) into biofuels was studied using the cracking process over spent fluid catalytic cracking (SFCC) catalysts. The processing of WCO was carried out in a fluid catalytic cracking lab-scale unit with temperatures ranging from 450 to 520 °C. From 480 °C, whatever the spent catalysts, WCOs with AV in range of 6–22 mgKOH/g can be converted to liquid fuels with the near zero AV (AV < 0.5 mgKOH/g). The yields of diesel, gasoline, LPG are in range of 25–29 wt%, 40–42 wt% and 14–18 wt%, respectively, while the coke formation is limited at 5–6 wt%. The increase of temperature to 520 °C enhances the conversion of diesel to gasoline and LPG. The presence of ZSM-5 in SFCC catalyst leads to an increase in propylene and LPG yields. Otherwise, higher rare earth content could limit the zeolite destruction, resulting in a better catalytic cracking activity. This study reports a remarkable approach that encourages the simultaneous utilization of multiple hazardous substances, SFCC catalysts and WCOs, as low-cost raw materials for biofuel production. Finally, after biofuel production, the SFCC catalysts can also be reused to produce high purity of a concentrate of La and Ce. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The combustion of biofuel in compression ignition engines produces lower carbon monoxide and unburnt hydrocarbon emissions compared to diesel fuel but higher NOx emissions. In view of reducing NOx emission, the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) technique was used in the present investigation to study its effect on engine performance and emission characteristics of a twin cylinder off-road vehicle diesel engine (Simpson S217-tractor). The blends of pine oil - soapnut oil methyl ester (P75SNB25), diesel - soapnut oil methyl ester (SNB20) were prepared on volume basis and used in the test engine with a fixed rate of 10% EGR under various loads. The soapnut oil was extracted from the soapnut seeds and trans-esterified in two stages using methanol and catalysts. The high viscosity of soapnut oil methyl ester is compensated by blending it with low viscous pine oil. The experiments were conducted in a four stroke, twin cylinder tractor diesel engine to study the performance and emission characteristics of the prepared biofuel blends. The results showed that the specific fuel consumption, exhaust gas temperature and HC emission of the hybrid biofuel blend P75SNB25 with 10% EGR rate decreased by 3.44%, 3.90% and 20% respectively than diesel operation without EGR at full load condition. The increase in brake thermal efficiency and CO emission of about 4.44% and 8% was also observed. For the blend SNB20 with 10% EGR, the reduction in HC, NOx emission and EGT was about 20%, 10.55% and 3.12% respectively at full load than diesel operation without EGR. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Using wavelet and fractal theories, cycle-to-cycle variations (CCVs) in a common-rail compression ignition (CI) engine have been investigated at engine loads of 25% and 50%, biodiesel blend level was from 0% to 100%. Wavelet power spectrums and singularity spectra were calculated to identify the dominant oscillatory combustion modes and multifractal complexity. Reaction paths and component consumption sensitivity of n-heptane and methyl decanoate were studied to reveal the effect of biodiesel blend level on the combustion process of diesel fuel. Results reveal that the effect of biodiesel blend level on the CCVs is more significant at a low load, even when biodiesel blend level increases to 20%, the coefficients of variation decreases from 3.99% to 1.57%. The CCVs exhibit multiscale dynamics for all tested cases, and persistent high-frequency oscillations appear around a 16-cycle period persisting over the entire or several hundred of the engine cycles. As the biodiesel blend level increases, the periodic bands with the highest power were interrupted and combined with lower-frequency and high-frequency intermittent fluctuations. However, for the higher load, the dynamics of CCVs are mainly displayed in an intermittent fashion. The larger broadness of singularity spectra at higher engine loads suggests a higher degree of multifractality. For all of the tested cases, the dynamics of the CCVs behave like antipersistent walks. As a oxygenated fuel, biofuel substitution leads to increase of c7h15-1 concentration and radicals such as OH, O and H2O2, which are beneficial to decrease ignition delay and accelerate the chemical reaction rate of diesel fuel, and therefore inhibit the CCVs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The conversion of renewable biomasses into biofuels and chemicals represents a strategic way to reduce the use of fossil feedstock, by contributing in switching to a more sustainable society. The use of agro-industrial wastes does not subtract resources destined for food consumption. In addition, waste utilization would result in a reduction of its accumulation, with a consequent decrease of environmental impact and financial losses due to the relevant disposal. In this context, a wide variety of exploitable agricultural resources can be used to support this sustainable growth. However, the characterization represents the first step towards a targeted and proficient exploitation of the chemical and energetic potential of a residual biomass. In this work, some representative residual (Mexican) biomasses were investigated: pepper residues (Hungarian yellow and red variety), coconut shells (Cocos nucifera), flamboyant pods (Delonix regia), seeds of avocado (Persea Americana), palm (Palma de Coroco) and nance (Byrsonima crassifolia) were chemically characterized and the relevant potential applications for the synthesis of biofuels and fine chemicals were specifically evaluated. Lipids, structural carbohydrates, and lignin were specifically valorized in a proficient cascade of technologies, which aim to exploit the correspondent potential, according to the principles of biorefinery and circular economy. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study has investigated on two objectives which are enhancing the microalgae Chlorella sorokiniana CY-1 cell disruption mechanism using thermal Fenton reaction and performing non-catalytic transesterification by ultra-sonication method. Radicles generated by Fenton reaction are rapid, dynamic, and the reaction was assisted by thermal heating to optimize the kinetic of the radical generation by obtained the lipid recovery for 53.3% and 977.41 mg/g at 36.5 °C with 4 min of contact time. The conversion of lipid into fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) through rapid non-catalytic transesterification using ultrasound was also performed. The significant parameters were done by varying the ratio of methanol to lipid, duration and pulse mode of sonication, to optimize the bonding reaction with methyl ester compound to free fatty acids. The formation of hydrocarbon chains with C4, C6, and C10 was observed at 8.20 mg/g, 0.33 mg/g, and 0.24 mg/g, respectively. This is a promising method as it is marketable and can be conducted in large scale with high process yield of F.A.M.E in a rapid manner. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bio-hydrogenated diesel (BHD) is a second generation biofuel that can be produced from vegetable oil and hydrogen via hydroprocessing. BHD is considered as one of alternative and renewable energy. This work presents evaluation of environmental impacts of BHD produced from palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) compared to fatty acid methyl ester (FAME). Greenhouse gas emission, energy consumption, and overall environmental impacts are assessed. System boundary is from palm oil cultivation to BHD production. The functional unit is defined as 1 kg of fuel produced at the plant. The results indicate that energy consumption of BHD-PFAD is 1.18 times higher than that of BHD-FAME, while giving GHG emission 13.56 times lower than that of BHD-FAME. The results of overall environmental impacts indicated that BHD-PFAD was 3.58 greater than that of BHD-FAME. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - The present study examines the effect of silicon dioxide (SiO2 ) nano-additives on the performance and emission characteristics of a diesel engine fuelled with soybean biodiesel. Soybean biofuel was prepared using the transesterification process. The morphology of nano-additives was studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The Ultrasonication process was used for the homogeneous blending of nano-additives with biodiesel, while surfactant was used for the stabilisation of nano-additives. The physicochemical properties of pure and blended fuel samples were measured as per ASTM standards. The performance and emissions characteristics of different fuel samples were measured at different loading conditions. It was found that the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) increased by 3.48–6.39% and 5.81–9.88%, respectively, with the addition of SiO2 nano-additives. The carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC) and smoke emissions for nano-additive added blends were decreased by 1.9–17.5%, 20.56–27.5% and 10.16–23.54% compared to SBME25 fuel blends. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Advanced biofuels are among the available options to decarbonise transport in the short to medium term especially for aviation, marine and heavy-duty vehicles that lack immediate alternatives. Their production and market uptake, however, is still very low due to several challenges arising across their value chain. So far policy has established targets and monitoring frameworks for low carbon fuels and improved engine performance but has not yet been sufficient to facilitate their effective market uptake. Their market roll-out must be immediate if the 2030 targets are to be met. Analysis in this paper reiterates that the future deployment of these fuels, in market shares that can lead to the desired decarbonisation levels, still depends largely on the integration of tailored policy interventions that can overcome challenges and improve upstream and downstream performance. The work presented aims to i) inform on policy relevant challenges that restrict the flexible, reliable and cost-efficient market uptake of sustainable advanced biofuels for transport, and ii) highlight policy interventions that, have strong potential to overcome the challenges and are relevant to current policy, Green Deal and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - The direct injection dual-fuel intelligent charge compression ignition (ICCI) is demonstrated as an advanced combustion mode with high efficiency and low emissions at medium to high engine loads, owing to the flexible in-cylinder concentration control of two fuels with different reactivity. Due to the incomplete combustion of part fuels, the improvement of efficiency and emissions under low load is always very difficult for most of new combustion modes. To deal with this problem, this paper systematically analyzed the combined effect of intake temperature, intake pressure, direct injection timings and the corresponding energy ratio of the two fuels on ICCI combustion strategy fueled with biofuels of butanol and biodiesel at indicated mean effective pressure of 4 bar. Results show that the high efficiency, low hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (PM) emissions are obtained at relative high intake temperature and low intake pressure condition. Sufficiently advance direct injection timing (SOI1) of the butanol could shorten the combustion duration and improve indicated thermal efficiency (ITE), along with the reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and PM emissions, while the ignition delay is insensitive to SOI1. MPRR is significantly reduced with the advance of direct injection timing of biodiesel (SOI2), which improves the combustion process and reduces pollutant emissions, especially for NOx emissions. CO and HC emissions increase at first and then decrease with the advance of SOI2. Based on the optimized intake boundary conditions, as the butanol energy ratio is upgraded, the ITE shows slightly decrease at first and then increase, but the NOx emissions are close to zero. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Compression ignition engines powered by diesel are the work horses of developing countries like India. However, burning fossil fuel causes a lot of air pollution and the depletion of fuel at an alarming rate. Fuels produced from biomass or wastes can partially substitute fossil diesel to decrease its consumption. One such feedstock is waste cooking oil (WCO) which can be easily converted into fuel for diesel engines. The hydrotreating process stands out among the methods available for converting WCO into fuel, since its properties are almost similar to fossil diesel with little or no oxygen content. In this study, the physico-chemical properties of the hydrotreated waste cooking oil (HVO), biodiesel of waste cooking oil, diesel and blends of HVO and diesel are compared. The blends were prepared by mixing 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% of HVO on volume basis in diesel. The evaporation rate and ignition probability of the fuel samples were found by using a hot-plate test setup. HVO had higher ignition probability than all the test sample. As the percentage of HVO increased in the test samples, the ignition probability increased. The Sauter mean diameter (SMD) of the samples was also found using Malvern Spraytec. The SMD of HVO was larger than diesel but smaller than biodiesel. The study shows that blends of HVO up to 30% are feasible for present use in diesel engines, as the viscosity (2.54, 2.59 and 2.62cSt) and calorific value (42.41, 42.29, 42.08 MJ/kg) of the three blends (10%, 20% and 30%) is close to diesel (2.51cSt and 42.58 MJ/kg). Also, due to high cetane index, neat HVO or blends having higher HVO content (> 30%) cannot be used in the existing engines as the engine power output may be affected. Therefore, to use these fuels, the engine needs to be modified which is not feasible for existing engines. The FTIR and GC-MS analysis shows that the HVO has low oxygen content and high amount of paraffins, whereas biodiesel of waste cooking oil has high unsaturation and high oxygen content. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - With the rapid growth in population and urbanization, a development in sustainable treatment of sewage sludge has become an urgent environmental concern globally. Lipid extraction has been investigated in order to valorize waste sewage sludge treatment through a pathway that leads to biodiesel. In this work, an integrated approach that combines lipid extraction of sewage sludge with hydrothermal liquefaction of the lipid-extracted sludge was studied in order to maximize valorization. The hydrothermal process was performed at temperatures ranging from 250 to 350 °C with 20 min. Regarding the bio-crude: below 300 °C, similar values are found with and without lipid-extraction, with the former variant containing more nitrogenated compounds stemming from Maillard reactions, while the latter more hydrocarbons; at 350 °C, higher bio-crude is obtained from raw sewage sludge owning to the conversion of lipids. Palmitic acid was selected as a model lipid to elucidate the role of lipids during the process, as well as to provide an improved understanding of the reaction network. Energy recovery reached values of 85.4% for hydrothermal liquefaction of sewage sludge and 98.3% for integrated approach considering the whole range of biofuel products. The energy consumption ratio was applied to estimate energetic efficiency for the combined process, making it possible to estimate the breakeven point of the process, plus the efficiency of both the hydrothermal process on its own in comparison with the combined option. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Butanol offers more promising results compared to lower carbon alcohol. Yet, it has not been commercially produced as a biofuel due to its expensive recovery process from Acetone-Butanol-Ethanol (ABE) fermentation. If ABE is used directly as a biofuel, the process will be more straightforward, thus eliminating its energy and cost-intensive purification process. Study on ABE as a biofuel has become a growing field for the last five years. Several preliminary studies have reported convincing results of using ABE-diesel blends in diesel engines. However, many of the studies on ABE lacks clarity regarding its fuel properties. In fact, no previous study has investigated the fuel properties of ABE. Therefore, this study aims to quantify some critical physico-chemical properties of ABE-diesel blends. Several important fuel properties were investigated in this study; calorific value, density, kinematic viscosity, distillation characteristics and cetane index. In terms of blending strategy, results from this study indicate that ABE(3 6 1) can be added up to 42% to diesel fuel, while ABE(6 3 1) and ABE(1 3 6) can only be added up to 22% and 23%, respectively. Also, the mathematical correlations to estimate ABE's fuel properties are presented. The equations developed in this study gave have high coefficient of determination values. They can serve as prediction models for future studies. Considering its relatively low-cost production and satisfying physico-chemical properties, ABE has the potential to become a promising alternative biofuel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Currently, wastewater processing through anaerobic digestion can generate not only biofuels such as biohydrogen and methane, but also value-added soluble-phase intermediates (e.g. carboxylic acids), which have numerous applications. This study investigates the potential of using sugarcane vinasse, the main byproduct from ethanol production, as substrate in dark fermentation to recover soluble metabolites through the biorefinery approach. The impacts of temperature (30–60 °C) and initial pH (5.0–10.0) were initially assessed in batch tests using microbial consortia obtained from the natural fermentation of vinasse. The yield (401 mg-CODorganic acids g−1CODtinitial) and productivity (653 mg-CODorganic acids L−1 d−1) of organic acids were maximized at alkaline/mesophilic (pH = 8.8–10.0; 40 °C) conditions. Acetic-type fermentation prevailed at 30–40 °C, whilst butyrate was the primary metabolite at a higher temperature (60 °C). Further chain elongation-based experiments were conducted by adding ethanol and lactate as exogenous carbon sources in vinasse fermentation, also using vinasse-derived microbial consortia as the inoculum. Lactate was added as both chemical reactant and fermented cassava flour wastewater (fCFW). Ethanol addition was irrelevant to the acidogenic activity. Conversely, lactate addition directly increased the production of propionic, butyric, (iso)valeric, and caproic acids, with a predominance of butyrate. Chain elongation was particularly favored when adding fCFW with pH adjusted to 7.0, boosting the generation of caproic acid from lactate and butyrate and (iso)valeric acid from acetate and propionate. These results highlight the potential for producing organic acids from vinasse as an alternative to gaseous fuels, expanding the suitability of dark fermentation targeting bioresource recovery from sugarcane. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The production of ‘Jet Biofuel’ has been identified as a promising strategy to mitigate the carbon footprint of the aviation sector. During the past decade, the commercial production of Jet Biofuel has attracted the attention of airline companies and governments across the globe. However, achieving a competitive production cost and sustainable Jet Biofuel remains a challenge. In this regard, various feedstocks have been tested for this purpose, where the vast majority have not complied with sustainability and feasibility expectations. Although not fully utilised in the Jet Biofuel industry, Jatropha curcas has emerged as one of the most promising feedstocks for Jet Biofuel production, since it is non-edible and is able to grow in non-arable lands with minimal water and energy requirements. This study presents a novel integrated pathway that utilises all parts of Jatropha fruit to produce a cost-effective Jet Biofuel using conventional hydroprocess, gasification, Fischer-Tropsch and reforming technologies. Different integration techniques are employed, including waste valorisation, by-products incorporation, as well as water, heat and power integration. The effect of various operating parameters on the products’ characteristics and yields has been evaluated. The model is validated against literature experimental data and demonstrates promising results. Whereby, 49 wt% of Jatropha fruit is converted into liquid fuels, with a Jet Biofuel selectivity of 65%, which represents an increment of almost 88% of Jet Biofuel yield compared to processing Jatropha oil alone. Furthermore, the system developed is power and water self-sufficient. The proposed pathway significantly lowers the production cost of Jet Biofuel below the market price of conventional Jet-A fuel for the base year of analysis, achieving a minimum selling price of 0.445 $/kg. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - The low carbon biofuel (pine oil) derived from the pine tree is endowed with enhanced fuel properties with good octane rating and can be used for SI engine applications. In order to operate pine oil blends with improved fuel efficiency, engine design modification is required. This work investigates the change reflected on the engine characteristics of the port fuelled SI engine due to a thin thermal barrier coating layer formed on the piston crown using the Micro-arc oxidation technique. Furthermore, an endoscopic visualization technique was adopted to compare the combustion flames of uncoated and coated piston engines fuelled with pine oil blends. The coated piston engine fuelled by pine oil blends displayed improved peak in-cylinder pressure and heat release rate. Among the pine oil blends, P20 (20% pine oil + 80% gasoline) blend showed superior engine characteristics at all engine load conditions. The brake thermal efficiency of the coated piston engine fuelled with the P20 blend was improved by 1.8% compared to the uncoated piston fuelled with gasoline. With the P20 blend, the CO, HC emissions were decreased by 8% and 14% respectively and NO emission was increased by 19% for coated piston when compared to gasoline with an uncoated piston engine. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the last few years, increasing concern about the harmful effects of the use of fossil fuels in internal combustion engines has been observed. In addition, the limited availability of crude oil has driven the interest in alternative fuels, especially biofuels. In the context of spark ignition engines, bioalcohols are of great interest owing to their similarities and blend capacities with gasoline. Methanol and ethanol have been widely used, mainly due to their knocking resistance. Another alcohol of great interest is butanol, thanks to its potential of being produced as biofuel and its heat value closer to gasoline. In this study, a comparative study of gasoline–alcohol blend combustion, with up to 20% volume, with neat gasoline has been carried out. A single-cylinder, variable compression ratio, Cooperative Fuel Research-type spark ignition engine has been employed. The comparison is made in terms of fuel conversion efficiency and flame development angle. Relevant information related to the impact in the combustion process of the use of the three main alcohols used in blends with gasoline has been obtained. © IMechE 2019.

AB  - It is believed that several global policies incentivising the energetic utilisation of Crude Tall Oil (CTO) might have had an impact on the demand for CTO from its competing and emerging end-use application in biofuels in the recent years. Hence, this study performed a methodological and structural analysis of the global CTO chain to assess the availability of the CTO (supply) and its demand in the respective end-use markets globally. The overarching goal was to examine whether market distortions occur when CTO is diverted from its historical utilisation in the production of bio-chemicals to the production of biofuels. The methodology consisted of collecting and analysing primary data from currently operating as well as upcoming softwood kraft pulp mills, CTO fractionators and refiners. Additionally, present day as well as upcoming CTO-based biofuel capacities were also collected. The geographical scope covered the following five regions: (1) North America, (2) Europe, (3) Russian region and the common wealth of independent states (CIS) (4) South America (5) Rest of the World. The analysis shows that since 2009 there is a steady rise in the global CTO supply, with a 16% increase in supply until 2018 compared to 2009 levels, with supply and demand in balance. However, this balance is expected to shift after the year 2020, where a tipping point could be reached, since the global CTO demand may exceed the global CTO supply for the first time. This shift in balance can primarily be attributed to the continuously growing demand for biofuels (capacity expansions and new capacities), and will – at least on short term – be reflective of the European legislation and its national implementation by member states. In particular, the estimations project a supply deficit of CTO of 0.6% in 2020. This deficit will rise to 8% or 0.18 million tonnes by 2030 globally, and is driven primarily by the increase in demand for CTO-based biofuels for transportation. The supply-demand imbalance for CTO might grow further unless alternative raw materials become available or corrective legislative measures are taken. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Two different SCR catalysts, V2O5-WO3/TiO2 and Cu-SSZ-13, were exposed to biodiesel exhausts generated by a diesel burner. The effect of phosphorus and sulfur on the SCR performance of these catalysts was investigated by doping the fuel with P-, S-, or P + S-containing compounds. Elemental analyses showed that both catalysts captured phosphorus while only Cu-SSZ-13 captured sulfur. High molar P/V ratios, up to almost 3, were observed for V2O5-WO3/TiO2, while the highest P/Cu ratios observed were slightly above 1 for the Cu-SSZ-13 catalyst. Although the V2O5-WO3/TiO2 catalyst captured more P than did the Cu-SSZ-13 catalyst, a higher degree of deactivation was observed for the latter, especially at low temperatures. For both catalysts, phosphorus exposure resulted in suppression of the SCR performance over the entire temperature range. Sulfur exposure, on the other hand, resulted in deactivation of the Cu-SSZ-13 catalyst mainly at temperatures below 300-350 °C. The use of an oxidation catalyst upstream of the SCR catalyst during the exhaust-exposure protects the SCR catalyst from phosphorus poisoning by capturing phosphorus. The results in this work will improve the understanding of chemical deactivation of SCR catalysts and aid in developing durable aftertreatment systems. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Biodiesel obtained from low-cost non-edible oils is the most promising alternative fuel for conventional diesel fuel. In this current work, Prunus domestica kernel oil was used as a feedstock for synthesizing methyl ester. The FFA value of the kernel oil was examined by employing the isopropyl alcohol technique and found to be 11.63 mg KOH/g. Hence, oil was processed with a two-step transesterification process using acid (H2SO4) and base (NaOH) catalyst reaction to convert into biodiesel. To obtain maximum yield and high-quality biodiesel, an optimization technique was employed. In this technique, the process parameters such as experimental duration, reaction temperature, NaOH concentration, and methanol to oil ratio were optimized based on Taguchi technique. The investigations revealed that 150 min, 60°C, 8:1 ratio, and 1 wt% NaOH were optimal process parameters obtained with a reaction efficiency of 97.86%. The experimental analysis considered that the methanol to oil ratio was happened to be the most substantial entity using ANOVA. The biodiesel Prunus domestica methyl ester produced matched and fulfilled the standards EN14214. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Desalination using fossil fuels is so far the most common technique for freshwater production worldwide. However, such a technique faces some challenges due to limited fossil fuels, high pollutants in our globe, and its high energy demand. In this study, solutions for such challenges were proposed and investigated. Renewable biofuel blends were introduced and examined as energy/sources for desalination plants and, in turn, reduced dependency on fossil fuels, enhanced pollutants, and recovered energy for desalinations. Eight different blended biofuels in terms of dual and ternary blend approaches were investigated. Results displayed that dual and ternary blends of gasoline/n-butanol, gasoline/isobutanol, gasoline/n-butanol/isobutanol, gasoline/bioethanol/isobutanol, and gaso-line/bioethanol/biomethanol were all not highly recommended as energy sources for desalination units due to their low heat recovery (they showed much lower than the gasoline, G, fuel); however, they could provide reasonable emissions. Both gasoline/bioethanol (E) and gasoline/biomethanol (M) provided high heat recovery and sensible emissions (CO and UHC). Gasoline/bio-acetone was the best one among all blends and, accordingly, it was upper recommended for both heat recovery and emissions for desalination plants. In addition, both E and M were recommended subsequently. Concerning emissions, all blends showed lower emissions than the G fuel in different levels. © 2020 by the author.

AB  - Biodiesel is a typical renewable and green energy, that is usually produced by the transesterification of edible vegetable oils. However, the cost of edible vegetable oils as feedstock accounts for 60%–80% of the total cost of biodiesel production. To overcome these issues, in this work, a low-cost feedstock, waste phoenix seed oil (PSO) with a high free fatty acid (FFA) content (30.1 ± 0.6%), consisting of the main fatty acid, linoleic acid (30.2%), oleic acid (22.2%), and palmitic acid (17.4%), was developed as a new feedstock to prepare biodiesel. A novel one-step method including simultaneous esterification of FFAs and transesterification of the PSO to prepare biodiesel was developed. Free lipase was used as catalyst. The influences of the reaction parameters were explored and optimized by response surface methodology. The results showed that the free lipase Lipozyme TL100L from Thermomyces lanuginosus can simultaneously catalyze esterification and transesterification. Under the optimum conditions (enzyme load 9.7%, reaction time 6.9 h, reaction temperature 31 °C and substrate ratio (methanol/PSO) 4.3: 1 (mol/mol)), the maximum biodiesel yield (93.8 ± 0.5%) was achieved. The activation energy from biodiesel preparation using PSO with a high FFA content was 39.7 kJ/mol. Furthermore, the kinetic values for K'm and Vmax were 0.18 mol/L and 0.043 mol/(L·min), respectively. The reaction mechanism of the simultaneous esterification and transesterification was also proposed. These results indicate that PSO with a high FFA content can be used as a potential feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2020

AB  - This study assesses the environmental potential of crop residues and the techno-economic potential of biojet fuel (BJF) production in Brazil. Different production routes are evaluated from two types of biomass residues (sugarcane straw and eucalyptus harvest residue), and four different technological pathways (alcohol to jet, Fischer–Tropsch, hydrothermal liquefaction and pyrolysis). The environmental potential of biomass residues is determined utilizing spatio-temporal projections of land-use change in Brazil and by explicitly modeling the erosion risk and the soil organic carbon (SOC) balance spatially. The assessment of the techno-economic potential of BJF production from the environmental potential of sugarcane straw (SCS) and eucalyptus harvest residues (EHRs) considers the BJF total costs, which result from a summation of biomass residue recovery costs, BJF conversion costs, and BJF transportation costs. These BJF total costs are compared with the range of fossil jet fuel prices at Brazilian airports to quantify the techno-economic potential. The environmental potential of biomass residues varies from 70 Mt in 2015 to 102 Mt in 2030, with SCS being highly constrained by SOC, whereas EHRs are more constrained by the high erosion risk. These quantities can generate a techno-economic BJF potential ranging from 0.45 EJ in 2015 (46 US$/GJ – 65 US$/GJ) to 0.67 EJ in 2030 (19 US$/GJ – 65 US$/GJ). In 2030, several BJF production routes can be competitive with fossil jet fuel prices. The northeast and southeast regions have the highest potential, especially in 2030. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Oxiranes are a class of cyclic ethers formed in abundance during low-temperature combustion of hydrocarbons and biofuels, either via chain-propagating steps that occur from unimolecular decomposition of β-hydroperoxyalkyl radicals (β-̇QOOH) or from reactions of HȮO with alkenes. The cis- and trans-isomers of 2,3-dimethyloxirane are intermediates of n-butane oxidation, and while rate coefficients for β-̇QOOH → 2,3-dimethyloxirane + ̇OH are reported extensively, subsequent reaction mechanisms of the cyclic ethers are not. As a result, chemical kinetics mechanisms commonly adopt simplified chemistry to describe the consumption of 2,3-dimethyloxirane by convoluting several elementary reactions into a single step, which may introduce mechanism truncation error—uncertainty derived from missing or incomplete chemistry. The present research examines the isomerdependence of 2,3-dimethyloxirane reaction mechanisms in support of ongoing efforts to minimize mechanism truncation error. Reaction mechanisms are inferred via the detection of products from Cl-initiated oxidation of both cis-2,3-dimethyloxirane and trans-2,3-dimethyloxirane using multiplexed photoionization mass spectrometry (MPIMS). The experiments were conducted at 10 Torr and temperatures of 650 K and 800 K. To complement the experiments, the enthalpies of stationary points on the ̇R + O2 surfaces were computed at the ccCA-PS3 level of theory. In total, 28 barrier heights were computed on the 2,3-dimethyloxiranylperoxy surfaces. Two notable aspects are low-lying pathways that form resonance-stabilized ketohydroperoxide-type radicals caused by ̇QOOH ring-opening when the unpaired electron is localized adjacent to the ether group, and cis-trans isomerization of ̇R and ̇QOOH radicals, via inversion, which enable reaction pathways otherwise restricted by stereochemistry. Several species were identified in the MPIMS experiments from ring opening of 2,3-dimethyloxiranyl radicals. Neither of the two conjugate alkene isomers prototypical of ̇R + O2 reactions were detected. Products were also identified from decomposition of ketohydroperoxide-type radicals. The present work provides the first analysis of 2,3-dimethyloxirane oxidation chemistry and reveals that consumption pathways are complex and require the expansion of submechanisms in chemical kinetics mechanisms. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - Oxiranes are a class of cyclic ethers formed in abundance during low-temperature combustion of hydrocarbons and biofuels, either via chain-propagating steps that occur from unimolecular decomposition of β-hydroperoxyalkyl radicals (β-̇QOOH) or from reactions of HOȮ with alkenes. Ethyloxirane is one of four alkyl-substituted cyclic ether isomers produced as an intermediate from n-butane oxidation. While rate coefficients for β-̇QOOH → ethyloxirane + ȮH are reported extensively, subsequent reaction mechanisms of the cyclic ether are not. As a result, chemical kinetics mechanisms commonly adopt simplified chemistry to describe ethyloxirane consumption by convoluting several elementary reactions into a single step, which may introduce mechanism truncation error—uncertainty derived from missing or incomplete chemistry. The present work provides fundamental insight on reaction mechanisms of ethyloxirane in support of ongoing efforts to minimize mechanism truncation error. Reaction mechanisms are inferred from the detection of products during chlorine atom-initiated oxidation experiments using multiplexed photoionization mass spectrometry conducted at 10 Torr and temperatures of 650 K and 800 K. To complement the experiments, calculations of stationary point energies were conducted using the ccCA-PS3 composite method on ̇R + O2 potential energy surfaces for the four ethyloxiranyl radical isomers, which produced barrier heights for 24 reaction pathways. In addition to products from ̇QOOH → cyclic ether + ȮH and ̇R + O2 → conjugate alkene + HOȮ, both of which were significant pathways and are prototypical to alkane oxidation, other species were identified from ring-opening of both ethyloxiranyl and ̇QOOH radicals. The latter occurs when the unpaired electron is localized on the ether group, causing the initial ̇QOOH structure to ring-open and form a resonance-stabilized ketohydroperoxide-type radical. The present work provides the first analysis of ethyloxirane oxidation chemistry, which reveals that consumption pathways are complex and may require an expansion of submechanisms to increase the fidelity of chemical kinetics mechanisms. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - The present experimental investigation has shown the biodiesel production from 2nd generation renewable carbon source, Karanja seed oil using graphene oxide (GO) immobilized lipase biocatalyst. The adsorption of lipase in GO was found to be most suitable immobilizing support matrix (adsorbed ~94 mg/g of GO) due to large specific surface area and abundant functional groups. The GO immobilized enzyme i.e. biocatalysts assisted enzymatic transesterification yielded ~88% of biodiesel using 1:8 Karanja oil: ethanol ratio, 25 °C, 3% biocatalysts in 24 h reaction time. The newly designed solar-driven direct contact membrane distillation module enables continuous separation and recycles of unreacted alcohol (&gt;99% recovery) from transesterification reaction mixture while yielding ~41 Kg EtOH/m2/24h using commercial PTFE/PET hydrophobic membrane. Subsequently, free glycerol was removed up to ~77% (permeate concentration ≤0.018 mass%) by cross-flow membrane module fitted with flat-sheet polyethersulfone ultrafiltration membrane. The integration of GO-based biocatalyst assisted transesterification and multi-staged membrane system for downstream enrichment of fatty acid ethyl ester culminates in the development of a cost-effective, energy-intensive and eco-friendly system which represents a sustainable biofuel production process. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Experimental tests were performed on a single-cylinder, four-stroke, direct-injection, naturally aspirated diesel engine at a constant engine speed of 1500 rpm and at various loading conditions to evaluate its performance, emission, and combustion characteristics. When DEE was added to the algal biofuel blend, the maximum braking thermal efficiency of the engine increased by 7.2% and the minimum brake specific fuel consumption reduced by 6.3%. A reduction in the HC (12%) and CO (19%) emissions was observed with a marginal increase in the NOx (3%) emissions compared with diesel, without any modifications. Moreover, the algae biofuel with diethyl ether (DEE) exhibited combustion results similar to those exhibited by diesel fuel. However, a shortened ignition delay was observed due to their early combustion. The Levenberg–Marquardt backpropagation feedforward neural network (BPNN) training algorithm with a tangent sigmoid transfer function provides an optimum model for effectively predicting engine characteristics. In this study, the overall mean square error, mean absolute percentage error, and regression coefficient for the developed BPNN model were 0.011%, 4.81%, and 0.96, respectively. The experimental results indicated that small content by volume of the algae biofuel blend (BD20) with 5% DEE as a fuel additive exhibited satisfactory results and could be used as a moderate substitute for conventional fuel. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Algal-derived bioenergy is one of the best alternative energy sources to replace fossil-based fuels. Algae are a diverse collection of oxygen-releasing photosynthetic organisms with rapid growth capacity that utilise commonly available materials for growth. Biological CO2 mitigation using microalgae is an environmentally friendly and economical method. Besides this, algae are able to live in extreme environments containing high amounts of heavy metals, making this a useful way to treat wastewater. The biomass produced from algae also can be used as a source of energy, chemicals and food. However, to ensure that the optimum blooming capacity is reached for the production of high-yield biomass for bioenergy resources, growth factors such as absorbed CO2, nutrient availability, light energy, temperature, pH and agitation should be studied comprehensively. This article provides a selective overview of the past and present studies of algal growth and the factors that affect the production of algal biomass. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Biodiesel is a promising alternative fuel for diesel engines, but its high viscosity and low volatility have limitations in decreasing emissions. As a renewable alternative fuel with a high oxygen content, ethanol blended with biodiesel can decrease kinematic viscosity and improve fuel evaporation. In this study, the effects of the ethanol addition ratio on the spray, combustion, and emission performances of a diesel engine fuelled with biodiesel were investigated. The spray characteristics were measured using a high-speed camera and Malvern laser analysis, whereas the combustion and emission performances were tested on a turbocharged common rail direct injection (CRDI) diesel engine. The results show that adding ethanol to biodiesel enlarges the spray cone angle (SCA) and shortens spray tip penetration (STP). In addition, the curves of the size–volume distribution (SVD) of the atomized fuel droplets move toward a smaller diameter, and the Sauter mean diameter (SMD) of the biodiesel–ethanol (BE) blends gradually decreases with increasing ethanol proportion. At low loads, the fuel injection strategy is multi-injection, and the peak cylinder pressures (PCPs) of BE blends are 0.77–1.96% higher than that of diesel at different ethanol blending ratios. However, the peak heat release rates (PHRRs) of BE blends are 9.3–11.5% higher than that of diesel owing to a faster combustion rate, longer main-injection duration, and more hydroxyl radicals generated in the pilot-injection stage. At medium–high​ loads, the injection strategy changes to single injection, the PCPs of BE blends are roughly equivalent to that of diesel, and the PHRRs of BE blends for different ethanol blending ratios are 9.76–11.91% lower than that of diesel. This is because of the lower diffusion combustion ratio, lower heat value, and change of injection duration corresponding to the variation in fuel properties. In addition, the results of the peak pressure rise rate and the cyclic variation indicate that the higher ethanol addition ratio increases the combustion noise and decreases the combustion stability. In terms of exhaust emissions, compared with biodiesel, with increasing ethanol blending ratio, the soot emissions for different BE blends decrease by 11.28–47.23%, the NOx emissions increase by 2.68–7.04%, and the HC emissions increase by 9.99–21.47%. Considering the engine performance comprehensively, a 20% ethanol blending ratio in biodiesel is recommended. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - The quantity of energy consumers in the country is extensive in the current quick-moving situation; the whole car industry puts a significant part in energy utilization. Biofuels have lured consideration among other alternative fuels as indicated by their natural element and synthetic creation.In this test, the aluminum nanoparticles are prepared by three various proportions (50, 100 and 150 ppm) being used in the base engine. To introduced thermal barrier coated engine in piston top face and the desired thickness is 500 μm with the assistance ofmethods using plasma spray and coated with PSZ material. A diesel engine is tested with 100% Borassus flabellifer, 20% Borassus flabellifer +75% mineral fuel +5% content of water and 20% Borassus flabellifer+75% mineral fuel+5% content of water + Al2O3 (50 ppm), 20% Borassus flabellifer +75% mineral fuel +5% content of water + Al2O3 (100 ppm) and 20% Borassus flabellifer+75% mineral fuel+5% content of water + Al2O3 (150 ppm),. The blend BFNP 150 shows an higher in break thermal efficiency by 5.12% when correlated with diesel fuel. The hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, and opacity of the blend BFNP150 decreased by 22.42%, 31.98%, and 25.12% compared with the diesel fuel. Oxides of nitrogen are increased by 11.24% in the BFNP 150 blends when compared to basefuel.To use the biofuel, the oxides of nitrogen are increased to reduce the NOx the water content is adopted into the fuel with the surfactant’s help. Most of the research the Span 80 and Tween 80 was used as surfactant due to the high HLB value, and stability of the emission is withstanding for long times. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - There is wide consensus that Spirulina can serve as a tool for wastewater management and simultaneously provide feedstock for biorefining. However, the economic aspects associated with its use remain a significant challenge. Spirulina cultivated in wastewater decreased the concentrations of both ammonia and nitrate and also served as a biodiesel source. The oil obtained in the feedstock was subjected to transesterification and turned into biodiesel. The biodiesel was subsequently analyzed in a test motor (water-cooled, four-stroke, single-cylinder compression ignition with injection). The tests were conducted at a constant 1500 rpm, and the output power was 3.7 kW. Mixtures of diesel and biodiesel were also enriched with carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The amount of CNTs added to the diesel was 30 mg L−1 . The algae and de-oiled biomass were characterized using XRD analysis, and an ultrasonicator was used to mix the CNTs with diesel and spirulina blends. A series of tests were conducted at different load conditions (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) for all fuel blends. Test results were compared with a neat diesel engine with a CR of 17.5:1. Among the fuel blends, the B25 reported improved brake thermal efficiency and reduced emissions. The outcomes are a reduction in thermal efficiency of 0.98% and exhaust gas temperature of 1.7%. The addition of Spirulina biodiesel blends had a positive impact on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, including reductions of 16.3%, 3.6%, 6.8%, and 12.35% of CO, NOx, and smoke, respectively. The specific fuel consumption and CO2 emissions were reduced by 5.2% and 2.8%, respectively, for B25 fuel blends compared to plain diesel and B50. Concerning cost competitiveness, vigorous research on microalgae for the production of biodiesel can cut production costs in the future. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Within the context of achieving low carbon shipping by 2050, high hopes are placed on alternative marine fuels in addition to a large number of technological and operational measures. A technological review has been carried out in this paper to determine the most promising alternative marine fuels considering the simultaneous reduction of sulphur oxides, nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide emissions as well as sustainability. Firstly, potential alternative marine fuel options have been summarized based on a review of published literature. Then, key physicochemical properties, feedstocks, production processes, transportation and storage factors, and end uses of zero carbon or carbon-neutral fuels have been analyzed. Finally, a qualitative ranking of the potential of different marine fuel options is presented based on a multi-dimensional decision-making framework. It was found that zero carbon synthetic fuels including hydrogen and ammonia accompanied by clean production could play a vital role in domestic and short sea shipping, though current costs and infrastructure are not commercially feasible. Methanol (fossil/renewable) appears likely to be the most promising alternative fuel for global shipping instead of other carbon-neutral biofuels such as renewable natural gas, bioethanol, biogenic dimethyl ether and biodiesels, which may be feasible for domestic and short sea shipping depending on local practices. It should be highlighted that marine fuel substitution is a prolonged process. Accordingly, consensus-building and action-adopting in the maritime community as early as possible is important to anchor expectations and achieve the goals of clean maritime transportation. © 2021

AB  - Pyrolysis bio-oil is unsuitable as transportation fuel due to its chemical composition and high oxygen (&gt;30 wt%) and water (&gt;20 wt%) content rendering the upgrading essential prior any downstream use. The current work investigates the upgrading of a flash pyrolysis bio-oil via mild hydrotreatment (HDT), targeting to a potential intermediate refinery feed. Various operating parameters of HDT were tested, including three temperatures (573, 603 and 633 K), two pressures (4 and 7 MPa) and two H2/bio-oil ratios (506 and 843 NL/L). According to the results, during HDT of bio-oil, massive plugging by coke formed in the reactor. The unsaturated oxygenates in bio-oil are regarded as the predominant coke precursors since they can interact with the catalytic surface. From all the examined conditions, it was found that the longest catalyst life, (5 days on stream), was achieved at 7 MPa pressure, 843 NL/L H2/bio-oil ratio and 603 K temperature. Furthermore, several properties of the initial bio-oil were improved, such as viscosity (156 → 4.9 cSt), carboxylic acids (78 → 0.2 mgKOH/g), density (1.024 → 0.9162 g/ml), and oxygen content (37 → 4 wt%). Conclusively, mild HDT constitutes a promising technological pathway for bio-oil upgrading towards a reliable intermediate refinery feed. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Ambitious climate change mitigation scenarios require large-scale deployment of bioenergy and solar photovoltaics. Utilizing recently abandoned cropland for renewable energy production is a promising option for energy supply while reducing competition for land and food security. However, the magnitude of abandoned cropland and its potential for renewable energy production is still unclear. Here, we mapped recently abandoned croplands at a global level and assessed the site-specific primary energy potentials for bioenergy and solar photovoltaics considering local climatic conditions, energy yields, and socio-economic feasibility constraints to identify optimal land use for renewable energy production. Of the 83 Mha of the identified abandoned cropland between 1992 and 2015, 68% of the area presented higher development potentials for the establishment of solar photovoltaic compared to dedicated bioenergy crops. In total, 125 EJ/year of primary energy can be produced with this optimal land management, of which 114 EJ/year is from solar photovoltaic and 11 EJ/year is from bioenergy. This figure corresponds to 33–50% of the projected median renewable energy demand in 2050 across the 1.5 °C stabilization scenarios. Mapping the suitability of renewable energy sources across different local, environmental, and socio-economic constraints will help identify the best implementation options for future energy systems transformation. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Bio-based innovations do not evolve independently from each other, but are interrelated and may enjoy synergies, but also compete for resources (i.e. biomass, skills). Therefore, we explore possible transition pathways that distinct bio-based niches could follow during a joint transformation process. We apply the Multi-Level-Perspective's transition pathways to the four distinct niches of (i) bioplastics, (ii) biolubricants and of biofuels for (iii) road and (iv) aviation. A subsequent scenario exercise that combines possible transitions paths of these niches enables us to explore the special relation between the individual niches and to detect possible synergies or conflicts. The scenarios show that diverse developments between bio-based niches in terms of scale and type of transition in the future are highly plausible. Finally, based on the results we derive conclusions about appropriate governance arrangements for the bioeconomy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel, an unconventional fuel to substitute the existing fossil diesel, is non-toxic, biodegradable, possesses high lubricity and better combustion capacity. In this paper, a new eco-friendly solid catalyst was developed from anthill-zinc modification for methanolysis of low-grade feedstock (waste cooking oil, WCO) to make biodiesel. The zinc-modified anthill was prepared via the sol-gel technique and characterized by EDX, TGA/DTA, FTIR, XRD, SEM, BET and CO2-TPD. The optimum experimental conditions obtained by a central composite design were 17.99:1, 0.51 wt%, and 66.54 °C for the molar ratio of methanol to WCO, catalyst loading and reaction temperature, respectively. At these optimum values, the highest experimentally obtained biodiesel yield was 83.16%, which matched the predicted value (82.71%) reasonably well with R2 = 0.9914. According to gas chromatography analysis, the fatty acid methyl ester conversion under optimum conditions was 97.05%. While 20% blending of biodiesel on a volume basis with petroleum-based diesel showed remarkable fuel properties, the catalyst exhibited better stability after being regenerated and reused for six cycles. This study extends the frontier of knowledge in the economical production of biofuels from waste products. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The magnetic graphene oxide (GO) supported with heterogeneous ternary mixed metal oxide (MMO) was used as nanocatalyst to enhance the conversion of waste frying oil (WFO) triglycerides to biodiesel via esterification process. In this regard, acidic MGO was modified with three basic metal cations of cerium, zirconium, and strontium oxides to produce heterogeneous MGO@MMO nanocatalyst. The nanocatalyst was characterized by FESEM, TEM, EDX and FTIR. The influence of different parameters such as catalyst material ratio, methanol to oil ratio, contact time, and reaction temperature was studied. Based on the results of effecting parameters, the MGO@MMO nanocatalyst converted WFO to biodiesel with a yield 94%, a reaction time of 90 min, methanol to oil ratio (8:1), and a temperature of 60 °C. Esterification mechanism indicated the MGO@MMO nanocatalyst having both binary Brønsted acid–base sites that increased the conversion yields as compared to MGO and MMO at low temperatures. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study focused on producing high quality and yield of biodiesel from novel non-edible seed oil of abundantly available wild Raphnus raphanistrum L. using an efficient, recyclable and eco-friendly copper modified montmorillonite (MMT) clay catalyst. The maximum biodiesel yield of 83% was obtained by base catalyzed transesterification process under optimum operating conditions of methanol to oil ratio of 15:1, reaction temperature of 150 °C, reaction time of 5 h and catalyst loading of 3.5%. The synthesized catalyst and biodiesel were characterized for their structural features and chemical compositions using various state-of-the-art techniques, including x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (1H, 13C) and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. The fuel properties of the biodiesel were estimated including kinematic viscosity (4.36 cSt), density (0.8312 kg/L), flash point (72 °C), acid value (0.172 mgKOH/g) and sulphur content (0.0002 wt.%). These properties were compared and found in good agreement with the International Biodiesel Standards of American (ASTM-951, 6751), European Committee (EN-14214) and China GB/T 20828 (2007). The catalyst was re-used in five consecutive transesterification reactions without losing much catalytic efficiency. Overall, non-edible Raphnus raphanistrum L. seed oil and Cu doped MMT clay catalyst appeared to be highly active, stable, and cheap contenders for future biofuel industry. However, detailed life cycle assessment (LCA) studies of Raphnus raphanistrum L. seed oil biodiesel are highly recommended to assess the technical, ecological, social and economic challenges. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Vegetable oil market is becoming of increasing interest in the global biofuel industry. This phenomenon has also interested the European Union (EU), where the growing expansion of biofuel production is affected by political interventions promoting fuel security and environmental goals. Yet, empirical evidence on the impacts that changes in price of one commodity may have on the supply of another commodity are rather scant. We investigate these dynamics for the major sources of biodiesel in the EU and conclude on cross-commodity linkages for palm, rapeseed, soy, and sunflower oils. We also examine the acreage response of domestically produced feedstocks to changes in prices of vegetable oils. Our findings suggest strong and diversified path dependencies among vegetable oils that should be considered in planning sustainable biofuel policies. In particular, the empirical analysis reveals the great relevance of sunflower and soy oils, which show a high price responsiveness, and the high competition in end uses of domestically produced vegetable oils (i.e. rapeseed, soy, and sunflower oils), that tend to be net substitutes in supply. In terms of land use effects, we find that an increase in the price of imported palm oil results in a displacement effect in land devoted to rapeseed cultivation, whereas a surge in the price of sunflower oil decreases the use of land for rapeseed. Land use effects would be relevant in northern EU countries where the production of rapeseed is the most intense. A policy measure in the EU, incentivising the production of renewable and environmental-friendly fuel from sustainable feedstocks, would be positive for the domestic market to the extent that it stimulates the production of vegetable oils (soy and sunflower oils) with the highest direct and indirect emissions saving. However, the expansion of oil palm plantations in extra-EU producing countries and of imports to the EU would determine important impacts in terms of indirect land use change emissions and direct emissions due to increased transports. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Co-pyrolysis of rice straw (RS) and ulva prolifera macroalgae (UPM) was studied over a series of nickel-iron-layered double oxides (NiFe-LDO) supported on activated bio-char catalysts. Results showed that, co-pyrolysis produced higher bio-oil yield compared to the individual pyrolysis. Maximum bio-oil yield (46.68 wt%). was found with RS/A-UPM mixture biomass at 500 °C. While RS and UPM and it mixture (RS/UPM) without acid treated UPM was showed lower bio-oil yield. The catalytic pyrolysis up-gradation decreased the bio-oil due to the coke formation. However the bio-oil quality significantly improved with using the 5%Ga/NiFe-LDO/AC catalyst. Also, improved performance with higher amount of bio-oil and lower amounts of char and gas were achieved by acid washing the macroalgae, which is due the removal of ash content or partially fragmented the macromolecule compositions. Catalytic co-pyrolysis of feedstocks also revealed that introducing NiFe-LDO nanosheets into the activated char could result in NiFe-LDO/AC catalysts of higher surface area and increased active sites to adsorb oxygenated and nitrogenated compounds. Being impregnated by 5%Ga, catalysts with improved acid sites and thereby, advanced deoxygenation and aromatization activities were achieved. This implied that the synthesized Ga/NiFe-LDO/AC could be considered as a promising catalyst for RS/A-UPM bio-oil upgrading. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The increase in biodiesel production is leading to a scenario in which more glycerol, which is a by-product of this biofuel production, is generated each day. Among the many potential applications for this substance, steam reforming is emerging as an alternative for solving the glycerol utilization problem, while also providing a new and potentially green source of fuel. In this study, an exergoenvironmental analysis of this process for high-purity hydrogen production was carried out based on data obtained from an Aspen HYSYS® V11 process simulation. Three different scenarios regarding reform gas processing were evaluated from both technical and environmental points of view. Despite the high concentration of water and CO2 in the residual gas obtained after H2 purification, recycling this flow was found to maximize glycerol reforming capacity, while also increasing the system's overall exergy efficiency. For all of the scenarios evaluated through exergy analysis, the environmental impact associated to hydrogen production through glycerol steam reforming was found to be lower than the values reported for methane, indicating that this by-product may be a suitable feedstock for decreasing the environmental impact caused by the use of fossil fuels for hydrogen production. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Research on the production of bio-hydrogenated diesel as a green second-generation biodiesel is increasingly attractive for renewable energy utilization in engines, and has potentially been produced from the hydrotreating of vegetable oils. The present work investigated the hydrodeoxygenation of palm oil catalyzed by unsupported nickel-molybdenum (Ni–Mo) sulfide synthesized by a hydrothermal method. The effects of the operating parameters, such as the reaction time (0.5–3 h), temperature (280–320 °C), oil concentration (5–15%) on the n-alkane yield were evaluated. A longer reaction time and higher temperature promoted the reaction via decarboxylation and decarbonylation pathways. Under the appropriate condition (300 °C, 2 h, and initial H2 pressure of 30 bar), the yield of C14–18 alkanes was 75.3 wt%, while the selectivity of n-C15, n-C16, n-C17, and n-C18 alkanes was 21.8, 19.7, 29.6, and 28.1%, respectively. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed n-alkenes, alcohols, and esters as byproducts. Characterization of catalyst revealed it had a sandwich structure consisting of weakly coupled layers, rim sites and Ni edges, which catalyzed the reaction efficiently. The catalyst could be reused for at least four cycles of palm oil hydrodeoxygenation with retention of a good performance with the decreased 17–25% alkane yield (2nd to 4th cycle with 50.8–57.3% n-C14–18 yield). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae were grown in 12-L airlift photobioreactors (PBR) containing biodigested swine manure (BSM), cattle manure (BCM) and domestic sewage (BDS), with 5% v/v, 25% v/v and 30% v/v respectively and compared with synthetic medium CHU. BSM with biogas/air mixture (10% CO2) injection on the 8th day led to of 13,257 ± 430 × 104 cell mL−1, and 2.0 ± 0.16 g L−1 dry biomass with a 26% lipid content, which was approximately 70% higher than with air. After microalgae purification, biogas at the PBR outlet averaged 91% v/v CH4. In terms of bioenergy: i) the biogas lower heating value (LHV) increased from 22,554 to 33,294 kJ m−3 (47.6%) with BSM, and similarly with BCM and BDS; ii) lipid content was increased, and iii) biohydrogen production is expected to increase from the PBR. For wastewater bioremediation, the microalgae Tetradesmus obliquus were able to remove 99.3% of ammonia and 99.2% of phosphorus concentration from BSM. There was a 96% BOD (628 mg L−1 to 23.3 mg L−1) and 91% COD reduction (1262 mg L−1 to 132 mg L−1). There was a 70% increase in biomass production and up to 4-fold lipid content increase with the procedure in comparison to air injection. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The use of OH-impregnated CaO as heterogeneous catalyst in the conversion of refined coconut oil into crude biodiesel was investigated in this study. Wet impregnation method was used to study the effects of NaOH concentration (10–20% (w/v) solution), calcination temperature (550 °C–700 °C), and calcination time (2–5.5 h). Characterization of the OH-impregnated CaO catalyst was done using XRD, FTIR, and SEM. Conversion of refined coconut oil into biodiesel was performed via transesterification with methanol at 60 °C using OH-impregnated CaO as catalyst. Results show that a 66.36% conversion to biodiesel can be achieved in 10 min when 20% (w/v) NaOH solution was used during impregnation with calcination at 600 °C for 2 h. Addition of tetrahydrofuran as cosolvent increased the conversion further to 81.70% which is comparable to the 85.98% achieved when using NaOH as a catalyst under the same reaction conditions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The purpose of this work is to develop a magnetically recoverable magnesium substituted zinc ferrite nanocatalysts for production of biodiesel from waste cooking oil. Microwave assisted combustion process were employed to synthesis the nanocatalyst. The catalyst were characterized by XRD, FTIR, HR-SEM, EDX, DRS and VSM analysis. The VSM study revealed a relatively high magnetic moment and high saturation magnetization property useful for magnetic separation of the catalyst from the reaction medium. Biodiesel conversion of 99.9% was achieved at the optimized reaction conditions like 3 wt% of Mg2+ doped ZnFe2O4 nanocatalyst (ZnMgF5 sample), reaction temperature about 65ᵒC, methanol-oil molar ratio of 18:1 and reaction time 30 min. Investigation on the transesterification kinetics using ZnMgF5 revealed the rate constants ranging from 0.0375 min−1 to 0.2382 min−1, activation energy Eg = 52 kJ mol−1 and frequency factor A = 2.31 × 107 min−1. The negative values of entropy (ΔS°) indicates, increased randomness of the system. Thermodynamic parameters ΔG° = 87.17 kJ mol−1 at 338 K and ΔH° = 49.31 kJ mol−1 indicate that the transesterification reaction is non-spontaneous and endothermic in nature. The magnetically separated catalyst retained 94% of biodiesel yield even after ten cycles of recovery showing a very good performance. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present work is focused on the production, emission and performance characteristics at variable compression ratios (CRs) on a compression ignition multi-fuel engine using Argemone Mexicana oil methyl ester and its blends with diesel (on a quantity basis) was observed and compared with the same. The feasibility of employing Argemone Mexicana oil methyl ester as a biofuel has been determined in the present work. Experiments have been conducted at a constant engine speed of 1,500 rpm and results are obtained at different CR of 14:1, 15:1, 16:1, 17:1, and 18:1. The ratios of blends used in this experiment are D100, AME5, AME10, AME20, AME35, AME50 and AME100, where the values relate to the share of the type of fuel given by the characters. The significance of compression ratio on the engine performance and emission has been investigated and presented for all the blends of biodiesel. The optimum results are obtained AME20 at CR17, which shows that the values of brake thermal efficiency, brake power, and specific fuel consumption are superior to that of both diesel and other blends. These blends, as fuel produces less emissions of CO, HC and marginally increase in NOx compared to that of diesel.

AB  - The World has experienced the negative effect of using the convectional fuels in both usage and emission aspects in automobile. Due to these factors, there is a search for an alternative fuel. There are several methods employed in the preparation of alternative fuel. Biodiesel is one of the efficient methods, in which edible and non-edible oils can be converted fuels (biodiesel) by means of esterification process. In this paper, the Study of milk scum biodiesel is analyzed in single cylinder four stroke diesel engines by using different blends like B10, B20 and B30 at different loading condition. From this investigation, B20 provide improvement in the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) compare to other biodiesel blends. The emission analysis shows the Unburnt Hydrocarbon (UBH) and Carbon Monoxide (CO) decreases and the Nitrogen oxide (NOx) increases for the blend B20. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The utilization of renewable lignocellulosic biomasses for bioenergy synthesis is believed to facilitate competitive commercialization and realize affordable clean energy sources in the future. Among the pathways for biomass pretreatment methods that enhance the efficiency of the whole biofuel production process, the combined microwave irradiation and physicochemical approach is found to provide many economic and environmental benefits. Several studies on microwave-based pretreatment technologies for biomass conversion have been conducted in recent years. Although some reviews are available, most did not comprehensively analyze microwave–physicochemical pretreatment techniques for biomass conversion. The study of these techniques is crucial for sustainable biofuel generation. Therefore, the biomass pretreatment process that combines the physicochemical method with microwave-assisted irradiation is reviewed in this paper. The effects of this pretreatment process on lignocellulosic structure and the ratio of achieved components were also discussed in detail. Pretreatment processes for biomass conversion were substantially affected by temperature, irradiation time, initial feedstock components, catalyst loading, and microwave power. Consequently, neoteric technologies utilizing high efficiency-based green and sustainable solutions should receive further focus. In addition, methodologies for quantifying and evaluating effects and relevant trade-offs should be develop to facilitate the take-off of the biofuel industry with clean and sustainable goals. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel will provide a significant renewable energy source for transportation in the near future. In the present study, principal component analysis (PCA) has been used to understand the relationship between important properties of biodiesel and its chemical composition. Finally, several artificial intelligence-based models were developed to predict specific biodiesel properties based on their chemical composition. The experimental study was conducted in order to generate training data for the artificial neural network (ANN). Available (experimental) data from the literature was also employed for this modeling strategy. The analytical part of this study found a complex multi-dimensional correlation between chemical composition and biodiesel properties. Average numbers of double bonds in the chemical structure (representing the unsaturated component in biodiesel) and the poly-unsaturated component in biodiesel had a great impact on biodiesel properties. The simulation result in this study demonstrated that ANN is a useful tool for investigating the fuel properties from its chemical composition which eventually can replace the time consuming and costly experimental test. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present study, eight seaweeds (five red, two brown and one green) were collected and evaluated for dual biodiesel and/or bioethanol production. The highest significant lipid and carbohydrate contents were recorded in the brown seaweed Dilophus fasciola (4.92 and 37.97%dw, respectively). Three routes were investigated, namely R1 and R2 for direct production of biodiesel and bioethanol, respectively, from the whole biomass, in addition to R3 representing the sequential biodiesel and bioethanol production. D. fasciola showed a biodiesel yield of 35.04 mg g−1 dw, composed mainly of C16-C18 fatty acids with a high saturation degree. All biodiesel characteristics complied with the recommended values of international standards. The maximum reducing sugar content (37.2 g L−1) and bioethanol productivity at 72 hours (0.165 g L−1 h−1) were recorded in the lipid-free biomass (R3), which were 16.3% and 27.9%, respectively, higher than that of R2. Therefore, a maximum estimated total energy output of 9.96 MJ kg−1 was recorded in R3, which represented 6-times and 28.3% higher than R1 and R2, respectively. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - In this study, a new recyclable TiO2-decorated magnetic ZIF-8 (Fe3O4@ZIF-8/TiO2) nanocomposite catalyst was first synthesized and its structural and morphological properties were characterized through different techniques such as XRD, FT-IR, TEM, EDX, TPD, and VSM. Then, biodiesel was produced using the Fe3O4@ZIF-8/TiO2 catalyst through the esterification of oleic acid in the presence of ethanol. Response surface methodology (RSM) was also employed to achieve the optimum experimental operating variables affecting the yield of biodiesel production. Significant variables like the amount of catalyst, the molar ratio of alcohol to fatty acid, reaction time, and temperature were optimized through RSM to achieve the highest yield of biodeisel production. The results indicated that the highest biodiesel yield is obtained at the reaction temperature of 50 °C, the reaction time of 62.5 min, the alcohol to oleic acid molar ratio 30:1, and 0.2 g (6 %wt) amount of catalyst. In this condition, the highest yield of biodiesel production was found 80% and 93% using ethanol and methanol, respectively; around 40% higher than pristine TiO2 and magnetic ZIF-8. Subsequently, the biodiesel production in optimum conditions was evaluated from frying oil by using the as-prepared catalyst. The result from 1H NMR and GC–MS analyses confirmed the efficient conversion of frying oil wastes to valuable biofuel product. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Considering the environmental and energy concerns, the need for finding an alternative fuel is increasing greatly. But also, the toil associated with finding the suitable fuel for the engine under study is very high. As a measure to reduce this work, theoretical analysis can be used in the search of suitable fuel blends. The present study deals with the creation of an Artificial Neural network (ANN), training, testing the network and finally comparing the predicted values with the experimental values. The test engine was operated with lemon peel oil, with different ratios of Di tertiary butyl peroxide (DTBP), rice husk nanoparticles and water injection. Six engine output parameters (BTE, BSFC, HC, NOx, CO &amp; Smoke) were predicted for different input values of engine load, DTBP proportions, RH nanoparticle concentration and water injection percentage. A single cylinder constant speed direct injection diesel engine is used for obtaining all the experimental values. From the obtained results a data set of 70 experimental values were used to train and test the neural network formed. The predicted values were correlated with the experimental values and the R2 was found for each correlation. The R2 values, thus obtained is in the range of 0.98209 to 0.99744 (which is very close to unity) thus proving that the network created were able to predict the performance and emissions of engine accurately. This work shows the prediction of multi component fuel mixture using ANN, which is new and also helps to reduce the experimental works needed to find the engine output parameters. © 2020

AB  - Biodiesel production calls for innovative solutions to turn into a competitive process with a reduced environmental impact. One of the process bottlenecks stands in the immiscibility of oil and alcohol as raw materials, so mixing process largely impacts the overall process cost. This process step, if carried out by using hydrodynamic cavitation, has the possibility to become a benchmark for large scale applications. In this paper a process analysis of biodiesel production scheme is developed starting from two different feedstocks, virgin oil and waste cooking oil. At the first the traditional process scheme has been simulated, in a second simulation, the reactor for the biodiesel production is interchanged with a hydrodynamic cavitation reactor. In the paper, the comparison between the traditional and innovative process by using life cycle costing approach has been presented, thus providing indications for industrial technological implementation coming from a professional tool for process analysis. It is worth noting that the introduction of hydrodynamic cavitation reduces of about 40% the energy consumption with respect to the traditional process. As regards the total treatment costs, when using virgin oil as feedstock, they were in the range 820–830 €/t (innovative and traditional process, respectively); while starting from waste cooking oil the costs decreased of about 60%, down to 290–300 €/t (innovative and traditional process, respectively). © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study offered a comprehensive investigation on engine performance and emission characteristics of Kirloskar make tangentially vertical (TV1) model single-cylinder direct injection diesel engine fuelled with diesel as a benchmark fuel. Steam distilled orange oil was converted into orange oil methyl ester (OME) by means of transesterification process. The physical and chemical properties of fuels were measured and conformed to ASTM biodiesel standards and compared with diesel. Likewise, the chemical compositions of the prepared biodiesel were estimated by using GC-MS analysis. OME comprises of 86.37% of (E)-3-propylidenecyclopentene (C8H12) in the maximum range. The presence of free fatty acids such as linoleic acid, palmitic acid and myristic acid in OME permits it to be the acceptable renewable resource for the production of biodiesel. Further, the work was progressed with the addition of oxygenated additives like ethanol and diethyl ether to OME to attain the improved fuel properties. Five and 10% volume of ethanol and diethyl ether were added to OME as oxygenated additives respectively. OME10DEE showed higher performance characteristics than diesel and OME blends. Further, a significant reduction in HC, NOx and smoke emission was noticed with OME10DEE. The present work recommended the application of OME10DEE as an alternative fuel on account of its better engine performance and emission characteristics than other fuel blends. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - High molecular weight alcohol and ether fuels with their advanced autoignition propensities and oxygenated molecular structures are promising future fuel candidates for compression-ignition engine application, because they can provide improved combustion efficiencies and reduced pollutant emissions. In addition, their production from lignocellulosic biomass as second-generation biofuels offers an improved CO2 balance and avoids the adverse impact of the first-generation biofuel production on the food supply. This review aims to summarize the recent research progress on the combustion of long-chain alcohols and ethers with more than four carbon atoms, putting a particular emphasis on their fundamental combustion kinetics. The article starts with aspects related to their production routes, physical and chemical properties, and practical applications, highlighting the resulting consequences for their potentials as renewable fuels in comparison with conventional diesel fuels. This is followed by a comprehensive evaluation of their fundamental ignition and combustion characteristics. The existing chemical mechanisms for the oxidation of higher alcohols and ethers are introduced in conjunction with discussions of their development approaches. Their reaction kinetics are further explored to understand the dependence of their combustion behaviors on the molecule's structural features, such as functional groups and carbon chain length. In particular, the different influences of the molecule size on the cetane numbers of longer alcohols and ethers are analyzed. The review finishes with a discussion suggesting directions for future experimental and numerical investigations, which will allow deepening of the understanding of the combustion kinetics of higher alcohol and ether fuels. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biodiesel production using supercritical methanolysis has received immense interest over the last few years. It has the ability to convert high acid value feedstock into biodiesel using a single-pot reaction. However, the energy intensive process is the main disadvantage of supercritical biodiesel process. Herein, a conceptual design for the integration of supercritical biodiesel process with organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is presented to recover residual hot streams and to generate electric power. This article provides energy and techno-economic comparative study for three developed scenarios as follows: original process with no energy integration (Scenario 1), energy integrated process (Scenario 2) and advanced energy integrated process with ORC (Scenario 3). The developed integrated biodiesel process with ORC resulted in electric power generation that has not only satisfied the process electric requirement but also provided excess power of 257 kW for 8,000 tonnes/annum biodiesel plant. The techno-economic comparative analysis resulted in favouring the third scenario with 36% increase in the process profitability than the second scenario. Sensitivity analysis has shown that biodiesel price variation has significant effect on the process profitability. In summary, integrating supercritical biodiesel production process with ORC appears to be a promising approach for enhancing the process techno-economic profitability and viability. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lipid-accumulating microalgae are an emerging feedstock for production of liquid biofuel because of their high biomass and lipid productivity. The potential of the green microalgae, Chlorolobion sp. (BIOTECH 4031) and Chlorella sp. (BIOTECH 4026), for biodiesel production was evaluated by analyzing the effect of nitrogen starvation (0.375–1.500 g L−1 NaNO3) on growth response, oil yield, and fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profiles of the two algal strains. Maximum biomass yields for Chlorolobion sp. and Chlorella sp. were obtained after 20 days of cultivation using the control medium (1.5 g L−1 NaNO3) with 0.873 g L−1 and 0.757 g L−1, respectively. An increasing trend in the total lipid yield was observed under a nitrogen-starved culture condition (0.375 g L−1 NaNO3). When the amount of nitrate was limited, the mean oil contents of Chlorolobion sp. and Chlorella sp. were 31.61 and 28.77% with lipid productivity of 227.84 and 151.14 mg L−1 day−1, respectively. Nitrogen starvation caused an increase in the lipid yield and a decrease in biomass production of the two microalgae. The FAME profile of the obtained algal biodiesel shows a high concentration of saturated fatty acid (SAFA) and monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) methyl esters which are desirable for biodiesel production. The fuel properties of biodiesel from the two microalgae were predicted based on the molecular properties of fatty acid methyl esters using empirical equations showing that the biodiesel properties of the two microalgae satisfied the set specifications of biodiesel standards EN 14214 (European) and ASTM D6751 (American). The quality properties of biodiesel obtained for Chlorolobion sp. were low density (0.89 g cm−3), low kinematic viscosity (2.79 mm2 s−1), cetane number (65.17), and oxidation stability (8.93 h). On the other hand, Chlorella sp. has low density (0.88 g cm−3), low kinematic viscosity (2.78 mm2 s−1), good cetane number (68.79), and oxidation stability (10.44 h). Hence, Chlorolobion sp. (BIOTECH 4031) and Chlorella sp. (BIOTECH 4026) have potential as raw material for production of biodiesel with superior fuel quality. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Biomass-derived intermediate chemicals, such as furfuryl alcohol (FA) and levulinic acid (LA) are feeds for ethanolysis reaction to produce ethyl levulinate (EL). EL is a promising chemical that can be used as a biofuel additive and precursor for chemical synthesis, such as γ-valerolactone. The present study conducted the ethanolysis of FA and LA using modified carbon cryogel as heterogeneous catalysts for improving the EL yield. The carbon cryogel (UCC) precursor was produced from urea and furfural, and modified via sulfonation. Iron (Fe) doping was then conducted to improve the surface chemistry of the catalyst. The catalytic activity of sulfonated carbon cryogel (UCC-S) was evaluated for LA ethanolysis, and the UCC-S-Fe prepared from the incorporation of Fe on UCC-S was utilised to catalyse FA ethanolysis. The effects of reaction parameters (i.e., time, molar ratio of ethanol to feed, catalyst loading, and reaction temperature) were significant on the catalytic performance. High EL yield of 95.8 mol% and 95.4 mol% were obtained from the ethanolysis of LA and FA, respectively. The performance of ethanolysis of carbohydrates and various biomass samples was evaluated to determine the EL yield using UCC-S-Fe. Both UCC-S and UCC-S-Fe were characterised using FTIR, XRD, TGA, NH3-TPD, BET, and SEM-EDX. The modification of UCC via sulfonation and Fe-doping improved the catalyst properties, and UCC-S-Fe demonstrated the potential to enhance biomass conversion to EL. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study investigates wastes and biomass as alternative fuels in a kg-scale burner in terms of combustion characteristics and emissions. Water washing, torrefaction, and their combination are used to improve the properties of the wastes and biomass. The air pollutants in the exhaust of the burner are also analyzed. It could be concluded that the reactivity and average heat supply from the pretreatment are improved significantly. The improvement ratio of average heat supply can be up to 103.5 %, stemming from water-soluble ash removal during water washing. Torrefaction can lift the average heat supply due to the increment of fixed carbon content in the fuels, but it reduces the reactivity owing to the decrement of volatile matters. Most of the raw or pretreated materials can be directly combusted, as a result of lower regulated air pollutants (e.g., NOx, SO2, CO) from them than from coal. Water washing can successfully remove chlorine in the wastes by dissolution since most of the chlorine in the wastes are in salt form. The chlorine reduction significantly reduces the HCl concentration (55–58 % reduction efficiency) and the toxicity concentration of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (78–84 %), while torrefaction increases the toxicity concentration owing to the de novo synthesis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Increasing biofuel production over the last decade and biofuel policies in Brazil, the European Union, and the United States have changed the global agricultural landscape in terms of land-use, commodity prices, and trade. Increasing fuel efficiency and electrification of the vehicle stock is projected to lower gasoline, diesel, and biofuel demand in the future. In this analysis, we quantify the effects of a 30% reduction in ethanol consumption in the U.S. and the European Union triggered by higher vehicle fleet fuel efficiency on global agricultural markets. Our results show decreases in global commodity prices by 1.9%–6.6% and a slight decrease in global cropland by 0.3%. Major changes occur in trade patterns with U.S. corn exports increasing by 30.3%. Global greenhouse gas emissions are lower due to the overall reduction in cropland. Gasoline and diesel consumption of the vehicle fleet is not changing rapidly but is a long-term process because vehicles are on average in operation for 10 or more years. Consequently, there are important long-term policy implications from changes in fuel efficiency requirements or ethanol blending limits that affect commodity prices, trade, and greenhouse gas emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is a fuel comprised of mono-alkyl esters of long-chain fatty acids derived from vegetable oils or animal fats. Biodiesel is designated B100 and is regarded as the major substitute for fossil diesel. Crambe abyssinica, a native plant from Ethiopia, has great potential for biodiesel production due to its higher calorific value and oxidative stability as compared to soybean oil biodiesel. Compared to fossil diesel, C. abyssinica oil biodiesel emits significantly less CO2 without efficiency loss. However, its crude oil only provides good results if it undergoes supercritical transesterification. Here, we aimed to produce ethyl and methyl esters from crambe oil under ambient conditions. Initially, we tested two methods to degum crambe oil: aqueous degumming and acid degumming. We subjected the degummed oil to transesterification through the methylic or the ethylic route, catalyzed by KOH. The methyl esters of the biodiesel obtained by esterification of crambe oil submitted to acid degumming had higher oxidative stability as compared to the methyl esters of the biodiesel obtained from crambe oil subjected to aqueous degumming: 15.7 h and 10.7 h, respectively, but the yield was lower: 70% vs. 80%, respectively. The ethyl esters of the biodiesel obtained from crambe oil submitted to aqueous degumming provided the highest yield and oxidative stability: 65% and 8.5 h, respectively. We also evaluated the oxidative stability of blends consisting of crambe oil methylic or ethylic biodiesel and soybean oil biodiesel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Durian peel (DP) is considered as potential renewable resource of lignocelluloses. The utilization of DP for the production of microbial lipid as biodiesel feedstock has not yet been reported. Hence, this study aimed to convert DP hydrolysate (DPH) into microbial lipid by newly isolated yeast R. mucilaginosa KKUSY14. Lipid yield of 1.68 ± 0.24 g/L and 1.68 ± 0.24 g/L was achieved in undetoxified and detoxified DPH, respectively. The main compositions of fatty acids were consisted of C16–C18 series with high content of oleic acid (51.2–65.7%) with the absence of linolenic acid. Over 90% of lipid in wet cell could be converted into biodiesel and most of biodiesel fuel properties reached the specified limit of ASTM D6751 and EN14214. R. mucilaginosa KKUSY14 has potential to convert 1000 g durian peel into 103.3 g biomass, 16.8 g lipid, and 15.86 g biodiesel. R. mucilaginosa KKUSY14 demonstrated good characteristics as promising yeast capable to convert DPH into lipids and biodiesel without detoxification. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Textile industry represents one prevalent activity worldwide, generating large amounts of highly contaminated and rich in azo dyes wastewater, with severe effects on natural ecosystems and public health. However, an effective and environmentally friendly treatment method has not yet been implemented, while concurrently, the increasing demand of modern societies for adequate and sustainable energy supply still remains a global challenge. Under this scope, the purpose of the present study was to isolate promising species of yeasts inhabiting wood-feeding termite guts, for combined azo dyes and textile wastewater bioremediation, along with biodiesel production. Results: Thirty-eight yeast strains were isolated, molecularly identified and subsequently tested for desired enzymatic activity, lipid accumulation, and tolerance to lignin-derived metabolites. The most promising species were then used for construction of a novel yeast consortium, which was further evaluated for azo dyes degradation, under various culture conditions, dye levels, as well as upon the addition of heavy metals, different carbon and nitrogen sources, and lastly agro-waste as an inexpensive and environmentally friendly substrate alternative. The novel yeast consortium, NYC-1, which was constructed included the manganese-dependent peroxidase producing oleaginous strains Meyerozyma caribbica, Meyerozyma guilliermondii, Debaryomyces hansenii, and Vanrija humicola, and showed efficient azo dyes decolorization, which was further enhanced depending on the incubation conditions. Furthermore, enzymatic activity, fatty acid profile and biodiesel properties were thoroughly investigated. Lastly, a dye degradation pathway coupled to biodiesel production was proposed, including the formation of phenol-based products, instead of toxic aromatic amines. Conclusion: In total, this study might be the first to explore the application of MnP and lipid-accumulating yeasts for coupling dye degradation and biodiesel production. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The aim of this paper was to investigate the optimum transesterification method for the production of biodiesel from microalgae. Chlorococcum sp. and Scenedesmus sp. cultivated in secondary treated municipal wastewater and in 1/3N BG-11 medium, respectively, were selected for the conversion of their lipids by one- and two-step transesterification processes. Sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide catalysts were separately employed in one-step transesterification process, and a two-stage process employing the basic catalyst followed by the acidic one in the second step was also used. The quality of the produced biodiesel was strongly determined by the catalyst used. The analysis of fatty acid methyl esters of the Chlorococcum sp. lipids showed that the two-step process has similar effects compared with one-step with acid (21.56 and 21.85 mg of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), respectively). On the other hand, better results were obtained through the two-step process with the Scenedesmus sp. (40.51 mg of FAMEs), compared with one-step methods with acid and base catalysts (9.57 and 22.3 mg of FAMEs, respectively). The type of methyl esters produced is strongly depended on the type of algal species and growth conditions. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Global concerns about CO2 levels in the atmosphere, energy security, and the depletion of fossil fuel supply have been the key motivation to develop bio-based fuel resources, which leads to promising and potential strategies of renewable and carbon-neutral biofuels. Among biofuels being strongly developed, 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) is a new alternative biofuel candidate since DMF could be synthesized from available and durable lignocellulosic biomass, as well as DMF's physicochemical properties were found to be similar to those of fossil fuels. Therefore, the comprehensive investigation on DMF is very essential before putting DMF into the commercial scale and the engine application. In this current work, the temporal evolutions of laminar flame characteristics including laminar burning velocities, unstretched flame propagation speed, and Schlieren images were critically reviewed based on the comparison of DMF with other fuels. Besides, flame instabilities were also evaluated in detail. Finally, ignition delay times were thoroughly analyzed with the variation of the initial parameters such as temperature, pressure, and equivalent ratio, suggesting that DMF could become the potential fuel for the spark ignition engine. In the future, the experimental studies on the real engines fueled with DMF should be carefully and completely performed to have a comprehensive evaluation of this promising biofuel class.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has exerted great shocks and challenges to the environment, society and economy. Simultaneously, an intractable issue appeared: a considerable number of hazardous medical wastes have been generated from the hospitals, clinics, and other health care facilities, constituting a serious threat to public health and environmental sustainability without proper management. Traditional disposal methods like incineration, landfill and autoclaving are unable to reduce environmental burden due to the issues such as toxic gas release, large land occupation, and unsustainability. While the application of clean and safe pyrolysis technology on the medical wastes treatment to produce high-grade bioproducts has the potential to alleviate the situation. Besides, medical wastes are excellent and ideal raw materials, which possess high hydrogen, carbon content and heating value. Consequently, pyrolysis of medical wastes can deal with wastes and generate valuable products like bio-oil and biochar. Consequently, this paper presents a critical and comprehensive review of the pyrolysis of medical wastes. It demonstrates the feasibility of pyrolysis, which mainly includes pyrolysis characteristics, product properties, related problems, the prospects and future challenges of pyrolysis of medical wastes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, medical wastes were often mixed with municipal solid waste and disposed of in waste landfills or improper treatment facilities. Many reviews have been devoted to the pyrolysis of plastics and other solid wastes. However, a review on the pyrolysis potential of medical wastes has not been reported previously, prompting its publication during this pandemic. Pyrolysis of medical wastes can deal with wastes and generate valuable products like bio-oil and biochar. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this research investigation, three microalgal species were screened (Pleurosigma sp., Amphora sp., and Amphiprora sp.) for lipid content before choosing the potential microalgae for biodiesel production. It was found that the lipid content of Amphiprora sp. was 41.48 ± 0.18%, which was higher than the Pleurosigma sp. (27.3 ± 0.8%) and Amphora sp. (22.49 ± 0.21%). The diatom microalga, Amphiprora sp. was isolated and exposed to a controlled environment. Two different media were prepared, and the main research was on the SiO2-NP medium as the cell wall of diatom was made up of silica. Essential growth parameters were studied such as dry cell weight and chlorophyll a content. The results revealed that Amphiprora sp. cultured in the modified medium showed a higher biomass yield and growth rate in all the analyses. In Soxhlet extraction method, biodiesel yield of Amphiprora sp. in modified medium under 24 μmol m−2 s−1 of light intensity was 81.47 ± 1.59% when using 2% of catalyst amount with 1.5:1 volume ratio of methanol/oil in 3 h reaction time at 65 °C. Results reveled that Amphiprora sp. diatom has a higher yield of oil 52.94 ± 0.42% and can be efficiently optimized with further studies with modified nanomaterial culture medium. The present research revealed the series of experiments on microalgal lipid transesterification and in future investigation different types of nanomaterials should be used in culture medium to identify the lipid production in microalgal cells. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Lemon peel oil (LPO) is a promising alternative biofuel for diesel engine applications due to its favorable physical and chemical properties. This study deals with combustion, vibration, and noise measurement for diesel engine powered with biofuel blend in the perspective of passenger comfort at engine idle condition. Experimentation is performed using a 20% blend of lemon peel oil with diesel (B20) according to central composite design (CCD) by varying pilot mass (PM), pilot injection timing (PIT), injection pressure, and engine speed (ES). Vibrations at engine crankcase, cylinder head were measured with a triaxial accelerometer along with noise measurement. The output responses for diesel and B20 were compared based on the output from response surface methodology (RSM). The study observed that predominant vibrations at the crankcase level along the lateral direction of the engine influenced by fuel injection pressure (FIP) and engine speed for both test fuels. Engine head vibrations were maximum along with the reciprocating motion of piston for both test fuels and found 7.43% more in case diesel. Engine noise is comparable from both test conditions irrespective of different influencing parameters. An increment of 1.662 J/deg in the heat release rate (HRR) of B20 is observed attributed to a longer ignition delay of B20 fuel. This study concludes that the lemon peel oil blend is compatible to use as an alternate biofuel in a diesel engine with suitable damping techniques for better passenger comfort. © 2021 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

AB  - The new European directive for the promotion of renewable energy mandates an increase in the share of advanced and waste-based biofuels in the transport sector. In this study, an advanced glycerol-derived biofuel was used as a component of a ternary blend, denoted as o·bio®. This blend included 27.4 %v/v of fatty acid glycerol formal ester, 69.6 %v/v of fatty acid methyl ester and 3 %v/v of acetals obtained as a by-product of the fatty acid glycerol formal ester production process (which were proved to improve cold-flow properties). Finally, o·bio® was blended with diesel fuel at a content of 20 %v/v. Two operating conditions based on usual driving modes were selected, where the engine calibration could be re-optimized after the change of fuel, corresponding to vehicle velocities of 50 and 70 km/h. Since the main effect of the blend used is to reduce particulate matter emissions, exhaust gas recirculation was increased and injection was delayed, so that the initial benefits in particulate matter emissions could be re-distributed into benefits in both particulate matter and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions. From a combined analysis of the particulate matter–NOx trade-off and trying to limit the negative effect of delaying injection on fuel consumption, the final proposal was to set an additional 6% exhaust gas recirculation at 50 km/h and an additional 3% exhaust gas recirculation at 70 km/h, while delaying injection 2 °CA after top dead center at both vehicle operating conditions with respect to the original calibration. The use of the blend along with the optimization of the engine calibration is expected to reduce particulate matter and NOx emissions by around 50% with a vehicle speed condition of 50 km/h and to reduce particulate matter and NOx emissions by around 30% and 40% at 70 km/h with respect to diesel fuel emissions. © IMechE 2019.

AB  - The growing anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions combined with the rise of the demand on energy resources has expedited research into sustainable alternatives to fossil fuel. In this context, biomass has increased in popularity and acquired a significant share of the global energy mix in a relatively short time. However, several biomass resources have triggered wide criticism for compromising food resources, agricultural lands and fresh water to produce energy crops. Therefore, a second generation of non-edible biomass such as Jatropha curcas has become a major biofuel feedstock for several countries. Not only can its oil be converted into liquid fuels, but also the Jatropha fruit residues have high calorific value and are processed into several forms of energy. Several studies have investigated the different processing technologies to produce energy and food-related products, although no conclusions have been made on the most sustainable pathway for Jatropha utilisation considering its interlinkages to the energy, water and food resources, whilst considering its possible contributions to mitigating carbon emissions and the development of circular economies. As such, this study investigates 11 processing pathways for the major three components of Jatropha fruit from cradle to gate via a combination of three key tools including Energy-Water-Food (EWF) Nexus, Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Return on Investment (ROI). Aspen Plus software is used to simulate the production processes including transesterification, hydrotreatment, hydrocracking, gasification, pyrolysis, hydrothermal liquefaction, anaerobic digestion, saccharification and fermentation, incineration and detoxification. In addition, a mathematical model is developed to run a five-objective optimisation study using MATLAB. The model identifies an opportunity to process the Jatropha oil by transesterification (49%), hydrotreatment (28%) and hydrocracking (23%). while it is suggested that the seedcake is best utilised directly as fertilisers (35%) and processed for energy production by pyrolysis (30%) and anaerobic digestion (17%). Nevertheless, the shells of Jatropha are best utilised via SSF (32%), pyrolysis (28%), anaerobic digestion (22%) and incineration (11%). © 2020 The Authors

AB  - In order to reduce the fossil fuel usage, to meet huge energy demand and lessen air pollution, a green, clean and sustainable biofuel is the only alternative. Biodiesel production becomes cheaper when we use a cheap precursor, eco-friendly catalyst and a proper process. Pig tallow from the meat industry containing high fatty acid can be utilized as an effective precursor for biodiesel preparation. This study produced biodiesel from pig tallow oil via ultrasonic assisted and CuO catalysed two-step esterification process. Cinnamomum tamala (C. tamala) extract was utilized for CuO nanoparticles preparation and characterized using infra-red spectra, x-ray diffraction, particle size distribution, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Biodiesel production was modelled using Box-Behnken design (BBD) and artificial neural network (ANN), in the variables range of ultrasonication (US) time (20–40 min), CuO nanocatalyst load (1–3 wt%), and the methanol to pre-treated PTO molar ratio (10:1–30:1). Statistical analysis proved that the ANN modelling was better than BBD. Optimal yield of 97.82% obtained using Genetic Algorithm (GA) at US time: 35.36 min, CuO catalyst load: 2.07 wt%, and the molar ratio: 29.87:1. Comparison with previous studies proved that ultrasonication significantly reduced the CuO nanocatalyst load, and increased the molar ratio and improved the process. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - For the first time, this work addresses the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of lignocellulosic bio-oil over a carbon–neutral Mo2C/CNF catalyst for the production of liquid biofuels and value-added chemicals, thoroughly examining the effect of the temperature, initial H2 pressure, reaction time and catalyst/bio-oil ratio. These variables had a significant influence on the process, allowing the transformation of the original bio-oil into different fractions in varying yields, including an upgraded bio-oil (17–72%), a solid product (4–44%), an aqueous phase (5–39%) and a gaseous stream (1–15%). The upgraded bio-oil comprised a mix of phenols (56–78%), cyclic ketones (7–30%), carboxylic acids (2–8%), esters (0–9%) and aromatic compounds (0–20%). The relative amounts of C, H and O of this product shifted by 34–78 wt%, 3–8 wt% and 13–62 wt%, while its HHV ranged between 9 and 35 MJ/kg. Process optimisation revealed that using a temperature of 350 °C, an initial H2 pressure of 40 bar and 0.19 g cat/g bio-oil for 1 h, it was possible to convert 65% of the organic content of the bio-oil into a liquid bio-fuel with a HHV of 30 MJ/kg (twice the value of the original feedstock), which represents a deoxygenation degree of 70% and an energy efficiency of 62%. Besides, all the bio-oil organic content can be converted into a liquid product with a high proportion of phenols (79%) at 250 °C, applying an initial H2 pressure of 20 bar and 0.14 g cat/g bio-oil for around 0.5 h. This liquid can be used as a sustainable phenolic-rich antioxidant additive as well as a bio-based source of aromatic compounds. Therefore, these results are a step forward in the biomass conversion over carbon–neutral catalysts. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The huge amount of agro-wastes generated due to expanding agricultural activities can potentially cause serious environmental and human health problems. Using the biorefinery concept, all parts of agricultural plants can be converted into multiple value-added bioproducts while reducing waste generation. This approach can be viewed as an effective strategy in developing and realizing a circular bioeconomy by accomplishing the dual goals of waste mitigation and energy recovery. However, the sustainability issue of biorefineries should still be thoroughly scrutinized using comprehensive resource accounting methods such as exergy-based approaches. In light of that, this study aims to conduct a detailed exergy analysis of whole-crop safflower biorefinery consisting of six units, i.e., straw handling, biomass pretreatment, bioethanol production, wastewater treatment, oil extraction, and biodiesel production. The analysis is carried out to find the major exergy sink in the developed biorefinery and discover the bottlenecks for further performance improvements. Overall, the wastewater treatment unit exhibits to be the major exergy sink, amounting to over 70% of the total thermodynamic irreversibility of the process. The biomass pretreatment and bioethanol production units account for 12.4 and 10.3% of the total thermodynamic inefficiencies of the process, respectively. The exergy rates associated with bioethanol, biodiesel, lignin, biogas, liquid digestate, seed cake, sodium sulfate, and glycerol are determined to be 5918.5, 16516.8, 10778.9, 1741.4, 6271.5, 15755.8, 3.4, and 823.5 kW, respectively. The overall exergetic efficiency of the system stands at 72.7%, demonstrating the adequacy of the developed biorefinery from the thermodynamic perspective. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Many investigations have introduced MgO as a favorable solid base catalyst. Although magnesium oxide catalyst does not have as strong of basic sites as calcium oxide catalyst, it is stable under ambient conditions. Furthermore, magnesium oxide catalyst activity is not sensitive to the water content of the reactants, which makes magnesium oxide catalyst possible for commercial purposes. In addition, the use of the non-magnetic catalyst could be facilely recovered by magnetic and reusable several times without a notable decrease in catalytic activity. In the present study, MgO /Fe2O3-SiO2 core-shell magnetic nanocatalyst was synthesized by precipitation method for biodiesel production. This nanocatalyst was characterized by different techniques such as Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) to recognize functional groups, measurement magnetic characteristics by vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), identification of the phase and crystalline structure of nanocatalysts using X-radiation (XRD) and a survey of morphology and surface properties by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Then, the synthesized catalyst was utilized to synthesis biodiesel from the transesterification reaction of camelina seed oil with methyl alcohol. A high biodiesel efficiency (99 %) was obtained under optimized conditions using the central composite design (CCD) based on the response surface methodology (RSM). The optimization was carried out in two separate parts; the initial part focuses on the optimization of the variables affecting the catalytic performance and the second part includes optimizing the variables affecting the reaction conditions of biodiesel production. The biodiesel was examined by GC- Mass spectra and physicochemical characteristics such as viscosity and refractive index. The optimum performance was achieved over MgO /Fe2O3-SiO2 core-shell magnetic nanocatalyst at calcination time 2.29 h, calcination temperature 650 ͦ C, 55.25 % w/w MgO to Fe2O3-SiO2 core-shell magnetic nanocatalyst, methanol to oil molar ratio 12/1, the catalyst to oil weight ratio 4.9 % w/w, reaction temperature 70 ͦ C and reaction time 4.1 h. Moreover, MgO /Fe2O3-SiO2 core-shell magnetic nanocatalyst could be removed facilely from the reaction system by a magnet and catalytic performance maintained for the four reused cycles. Based on the results, camelina seed oil could be utilized as a promising alternative biofuel for impressive, renewable and green production of biodiesel. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Olive agro-industry is a chemical- and energy-intensive agricultural activity and given its large scale globally is faced with serious challenges from the sustainability perspective. On the other hand, different by-products and residues generated are not generally used and end up as wastes. Therefore, it is of crucial importance to design and implement innovative platforms based on circular bioeconomy and zero-discharge principles to enhance the sustainability features of the olive supply chain system. In light of that, the present study was aimed at designing and experimentally scrutinizing two olive agro-biorefinery scenarios against the conventional olive oil production system (i.e., olive/olive oil production, including olive cultivation and oil extraction). The first agro-biorefinery system included olive cultivation and oil extraction from fruit and pomace for edible use. Moreover, the remaining pomace post-oil extraction was used as an animal feed. The second agro-biorefinery system included olive cultivation, olive oil extraction, olive pomace oil extraction, and its conversion into biodiesel. In addition, crude biodiesel glycerol was also valorized into two different phosphate salts and an oxygenated fuel additive (namely triacetin), while olive oil leaves were converted into a natural antioxidant for biodiesel. The performance of the natural antioxidant against the most promising synthetic antioxidant used by the biodiesel industry (i.e., propyl gallate) was also investigated. The developed scenarios were environmentally compared using the IMPACT 2002+ method. Overall, both developed agro-biorefineries outperformed the conventional system in terms of all four endpoint damage categories. Compared to the conventional olive oil production system, the production of 1 ton of olive oil in the first and second agro-biorefinery systems was associated with 10.62% and 4.08% saving in climate change damage category, 6.73% and 11.21% saving in primary energy consumption, and 12.01% and 1.55% saving in damage to human health. In addition, the implementation of the circular bioeconomy approach in olive oil production led to 31.28% and 26.38% saving in ecosystem quality damage category for Sc-2 and Sc-3, respectively. Overall, the weighted endpoint damage categories of olive oil production could be saved by 12.27% and 4.49% if respectively, the first and second agro-biorefinery scenarios were used. These findings revealed that through the transition from linear economy-oriented olive agri-food system to a bioeconomy-oriented olive agro-biorefinery, not only a wide spectrum of value-added bioproducts could be achieved, but also the environmental impacts per each ton of olive oil produced could be mitigated. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The production of alcohol fuels from bioderived feedstocks and the performance of next generation stratified low temperature combustion (LTC) modes for internal combustion engines are two research areas that have recently undergone rapid growth independently. Now, there is a need to bridge these two fields and identify the optimal combustion strategy for these biosynthesized alcohol fuels. This work addresses this need by using a metric called the normalized φ-sensitivity to analyze how the local ignition delays of regions in the combustion chamber respond to stratification induced by the compression stroke injection of fuel, thereby identifying the optimal next generation stratified LTC strategy for a number of biosynthesized alcohol fuels. The large set of next generation stratified LTC modes are generalized into two groups based on how the heat release process proceeds in the compositionally stratified combustion chamber: lean-to-rich burn stratified combustion, where the lean regions ignite first followed sequentially by progressively richer regions, or rich-to-lean burn stratified combustion, the inverse of lean-to-rich. The C1-C4 alcohols are prime candidates to enable lean-to-rich burn stratified combustion based on their high cooling potentials and lack of negative temperature coefficient (NTC) behavior. Specifically, methanol or water-alcohol blends were found to be the best candidates. The C5 + alcohols were found to be prime candidates to enable rich-to-lean burn combustion based on their emergent NTC-behavior and low cooling potentials that approach their alkane counterparts. Specifically, n-pentanol, n-hexanol, and hexanol isomers were found to be the best candidates based on balancing their normalized φ-sensitivity and their autoignition resistance. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Carbon capture and sequestration technologies are used to reduce carbon emissions. Membranes, solvents, and adsorbents are the three major methods of CO2 capture. One of the promising methods is the use of algae to absorb CO2 from flue gases and convert it into biomass. Algae have great potential as renewable fuel sources and CO2 capture using photosynthesis for carbon fixation has also attracted much attention. This paper presents an extensive and in-depth report on the utilization of algae for carbon capture and accumulation. This is done in conjunction with cultivating the algae for the production of biomass for biodiesel production. Different systems are investigated for algae cultivation as well as carbon capture to effectively mitigate carbon emissions. The performance and productivity of these biosystems depend on various conditions including algae type, light sources, nutrients, pH, temperature, and mass transfer. Macroalgae and microalgae species were explored to determine their suitability for carbon capture and sequestration, along with the production of biodiesel. The steps for producing biodiesel were comprehensively reviewed, which are harvesting, dehydrating, oil extraction, oil refining, and transesterification. This technology combines active carbon capture with the potential of biodiesel production. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The production of bulk chemicals mostly depends on exhausting petroleum sources and leads to emission of greenhouse gases. Within the last decades the urgent need for alternative sources has increased and the development of bio-based processes received new attention. To avoid the competition between the use of sugars as food or fuel, other feedstocks with high availability and low cost are needed, which brought acetogenic bacteria into focus. This group of anaerobic organisms uses mixtures of CO2, CO and H2 for the production of mostly acetate and ethanol. Also methanol, a cheap and abundant bulk chemical produced from methane, is a suitable substrate for acetogenic bacteria. In methylotrophic acetogens the methyl group is transferred to the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, a pathway to reduce CO2 to acetate via a series of C1-intermediates bound to tetrahydrofolic acid. Here we describe the biochemistry and bioenergetics of methanol conversion in the biotechnologically interesting group of anaerobic, acetogenic bacteria. Further, the bioenergetics of biochemical production from methanol is discussed. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Anaerobic digestion (AD) has become an effective waste management method in the agri-food sector to dispose of livestock and food wastes. As AD becomes more widely used new challenges emerge, such as the disposal of digestate by-products. Currently, the principal method for handling solid digestate (SD) is direct application to land as an organic fertiliser. However, as the sector grows, this option is less viable due to nutrition loading on the land and increased eutrophication. This paper explores the potential of using SD as a biofuel source. Additionally, the pyrolysis kinetic triplet of residual SD and thermal predictions was reported for the first time using Advanced Kinetics and Technology Solutions (AKTS) thermokinetics software to model and calculate the activation energy (Ea) and other kinetic parameters. ASTM-E698, Ozawa-Flynn-Wall and differential iso-conversional (model-free) methods were used and the Ea values calculated from each model were 169.8, 75 – 175.0, and 85 – 190.0 kJ mol−1, respectively. The kinetic triplet can be used in the scale-up or designing of reactor systems considering SD as a feedstock. The kinetic prediction of isothermal pyrolysis of SD indicated that a temperature higher than 210 °C is required for onset of decomposition in the sample. Furthermore, SD has the potential to produce an additional ~27.9 MJ per day at a 500 kW standalone on-farm AD plant. This work has highlighted the potential of waste solid digestate as a potential solid biofuel that could add an additional revenue stream to AD plants and make them more sustainable. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Construction of a multipurpose yeast consortium suitable for lipid production, textile dye/effluent removal and lignin valorization is critical for both biorefinery and bioremediation. Therefore, a novel oleaginous consortium, designated as OYC-Y.BC.SH has been developed using three yeast cultures viz. Yarrowia sp. SSA1642, Barnettozyma californica SSA1518 and Sterigmatomyces halophilus SSA1511. The OYC-Y.BC.SH was able to grow on different carbon sources and accumulate lipids, with its highest lipid productivity (1.56 g/L/day) and lipase activity (170.3 U/mL) exhibited in xylose. The total saturated fatty acid content was 36.09 %, while the mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated fatty acids were 45.44 and 18.30 %, respectively, making OYC-Y.BC.SH valuable for biodiesel production. The OYC-Y.BC.SH showed its highest decolorization efficiency of Red HE3B dye (above 82 %) in presence of sorghum husk as agricultural co-substrate, suggesting its feasibility for simultaneous lignin valorization. The significant higher performance of OYC-Y.BC.SH on decolorizing the real dyeing effluent sample at pH 8.0 suggests its potential and suitability for degrading most of the wastewater textile effluents. Clearly, toxicological studies underline the additional advantage of using OYC-Y.BC.SH for bioremediation of industrial dyeing effluents in terms of decolorization and detoxification. A possible mechanism of Red HE3B biodegradation and ATP synthesis was also proposed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Diminishing oil reserve, escalating energy dependence, and the environmental impact of fossil fuel utilization has led to research on renewable energy resources with a cleaner carbon footprint. Biofuel, especially biodiesel, has become a feasible substitute for petroleum diesel as it can be directly used in existing transport infrastructure without significant alteration. This paper starts by discussing some critical physicochemical properties and their effect on engine performance and emission. The research then proposes a ranking scheme to select the most suitable biodiesel based on six vital physicochemical properties: density, viscosity, heating value, flash point, cetane number and oxidation stability. The solution developed is independent of supervision, contrary to popular learning algorithms and can operate on the only intelligence whether an attribute is favourable by its higher/lower values. The novelty of the work consists in ensuring that the rarer properties pick up the greater weights and in establishing a simple ranker based on descriptive statistics. This scheme first generates transactions against each biodiesel which helps in association rule mining, which is later used to score/rank the biodiesels. The three phases and their subordinate sub-steps have been carried out using the platforms: Python, R and Tableau, respectively. The study endorses Brassica juncea, Cardoon (Cynara cardunculu), and poppyseed oil as the most desirable biodiesel feedstocks. On the other hand, cedar, castor and hiptage were ranked as least desirable in the list of 71 feedstocks based on the proposed ranking scheme. The proposed ranking scheme will help decision-makers such to analyze and obtain tailored biodiesel feedstock for their purposes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This review aims to encourage the technical development of microbial biodiesel production from industrial-organic-wastes-derived volatile fatty acids (VFAs). To this end, this article summarizes the current status of several key technical steps during microbial biodiesel production, including (1) acidogenic fermentation of bio-wastes for VFA collection, (2) lipid accumulation in oleaginous microorganisms, (3) microbial lipid extraction, (4) transesterification of microbial lipids into crude biodiesel, and (5) crude biodiesel purification. The emerging membrane-based bioprocesses such as electrodialysis, forward osmosis and membrane distillation, are promising approaches as they could help tackle technical challenges related to the separation and recovery of VFAs from the fermentation broth. The genetic engineering and metabolic engineering approaches could be applied to design microbial species with higher lipid productivity and rapid growth rate for enhanced fatty acids synthesis. The enhanced in situ transesterification technologies aided by microwave, ultrasound and supercritical solvents are also recommended for future research. Technical limitations and cost-effectiveness of microbial biodiesel production from bio-wastes are also discussed, in regard to its potential industrial development. Based on the overview on microbial biodiesel technologies, an integrated biodiesel production line incorporating all the critical technical steps is proposed for unified management and continuous optimization for highly efficient biodiesel production. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Dependence on fossil fuels for meeting the growing energy demand is damaging the world’s environment. There is a dire need to look for alternative fuels that are less potent to greenhouse gas emissions. Biofuels offer several advantages with less harmful effects on the environment. Biodiesel is synthesized from the organic wastes produced extensively like edible, non-edible, microbial, and waste oils. This study reviews the feasibility of the state-of-the-art feedstocks for sustainable biodiesel synthesis such as availability, and capacity to cover a significant proportion of fossil fuels. Biodiesel synthesized from oil crops, vegetable oils, and animal fats are the potential renewable carbon-neutral substitute to petroleum fuels. This study concludes that waste oils with higher oil content including waste cooking oil, waste palm oil, and algal oil are the most favorable feedstocks. The comparison of biodiesel production and parametric analysis is done critically, which is necessary to come up with the most appropriate feedstock for biodiesel synthesis. Since the critical comparison of feedstocks along with oil extraction and biodiesel production technologies has never been done before, this will help to direct future researchers to use more sustainable feedstocks for biodiesel synthesis. This study concluded that the use of third-generation feedstocks (wastes) is the most appropriate way for sustainable biodiesel production. The use of innovative costless oil extraction technologies including supercritical and microwave-assisted transesterification method is recommended for oil extraction. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The purpose of the current study is to inspect the influence of the addition of n-heptanol with methyl oleate biodiesel fuel at various blending ratio on the combustion and emission parameters of a common rail diesel engine to attain their optimum ratio. The n-heptanol is added at 10%, 20%, 30% and 40%, which are denoted as H10B, H20B, H30B, and H40B respectively. Studying these mixtures stability, all blends were kept under observation for more than one month, and they were stable at ambient conditions. The measured physicochemical properties of n-heptanol-methyl oleate blends show that there is a reduction in their kinematic viscosity and cetane number. The results for methyl oleate illustrate that the peak pressure is slightly decreased by about 4%, while the soot and NOx emissions are diminished by about 2% and 6% respectively compared to pure diesel fuel. The soot and NOx emission are reduced by up to 90% and 15% respectively when adding n-heptanol. The bsfc is enlarged by around 5% methyl oleate while it is enlarged by 15% for n-heptanol- methyl oleate mixtures. It can be summarized from the combustion and emission results that the proposed mixing ratio of n-heptanol and methyl oleate fuel is H20B. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, wood bark of neem tree (Azadirachta indica) is transformed into liquid (bio-oil), solid (char) and gaseous products via pyrolysis method. The main aim of this study is to analyze the effect of process parameters on pyrolysis yield, physical and chemical characterization of bio-oil, char, and gaseous products to find its feasibility as a commercial fuel as well as chemical feedstocks. The flash pyrolysis experiments were carried out in a laboratory scale fluidized bed reactor at a temperature ranging from 350 to 550°C, different particle sizes from 0.71 to 1.25 mm with a sweep gas flow rate of 1.25 to 2.25 m3/hr. The highest liquid product yield was obtained as 49.5 wt% at the pyrolysis temperature of 450°C, 1.0 mm particle size and at the sweep gas flow rate 2.0 m3/hr. The obtained bio-oil, char, and gaseous products were examined with FT-IR, GC-MS and Elemental analysis methods. Based on the elemental analysis of the bio-oil, the calorific value was found as 22.7 MJ/kg. GC-MS analysis of the bio-oil indicates that it mostly consists of phenolic and oxygenated compounds with alkanes, alkenes, ketones, and carboxylic acids. The pyrolysis gas fraction contains hydrogen, methane, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide. The obtained bio-oil and gas can be used as a bio-fuel and bio-oil can be used as a valuable chemical feedstock. The char obtained are carbon-rich and are nearly equal to the standard fuel properties. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Indirect land-use change (ILUC) can have a severe impact on the greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of biofuels. Mitigating ILUC risk is important to avoid additional GHG emissions compared to fossil fuels. This is possible by making surplus land available through land demand reduction and using this for low-ILUC-risk biodiesel production. For a case study in Eastern Romania, we calculated the rapeseed biodiesel potential and the GHG emissions of four measures to make surplus land available in 2020. Four scenarios varying in assumptions on productivity and sustainability in the agricultural sector show the variation in the potential of these measures. We find that using surplus land to produce low-ILUC-risk rapeseed biodiesel has a potential of 3-64 PJ, 1-28% of the projected Romanian transport diesel consumption. The main contribution to this potential comes from yield improvements in crop and livestock production. Average GHG emissions of the ILUC mitigation measures are -11 to 22 g CO2-eq MJ−1 (maximum total lifecycle emissions are 34 g CO2-eq MJ−1; 60% reduction from fossil fuel reference). This means ILUC mitigation is possible without necessarily missing the GHG emission reduction target, provided that the entire agricultural sector is sustainably intensified, going beyond a focus on biofuel production alone. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Among the main components of a smart city, the energy system plays a vital and core role in the transition towards a sustainable urban life. Furthermore, the utilization of renewable energy sources has been demonstrated as a significant contribution to reducing pollutant emissions and enhancing the quality of the living environment. Therefore, designing the energy systems based on clean and renewable criteria is considered a sustainable solution for smart cities. Indeed, the deep and rapid penetration of renewable energy-based technologies have been believed to very well fit into a smart city under various scales, this could supply a secure basis for a modern society with a low-carbon economy. In this review paper, the main components and roles of renewable energy resources (such as solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower, ocean, and biofuels) for the smart city were fully introduced. Besides, integrating the renewable sources form into the energy systems of smart cities was thoroughly analyzed on the basis of technical and economic criteria. Finally, existing challenges and future scenarios were also discussed in detail to clarify the progress and perspective of smart renewable energy systems for the smart city. In general, the integration of renewables into energy systems of the smart city is a sagacious perspective and solution aiming to achieve cleaner process and more sustainable development. However, the optimization issues of the energy system for integrating of renewable components, ensuring good stability, maximizing the operating range, and minimizing the investment costs should be critically evaluated in the future works. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Cyclopentanol is a promising alternative biofuel for automobiles. In this study, an optical engine was employed to investigate the effects of cyclopentanol blending ratios on combustion characteristics. Cyclopentanol was blended with diesel by 10% and 20% volume, denoted as CP10 and CP20, respectively. Comparison tests between blends and diesel (denoted as D100) were performed under three injection pressures (100, 120, and 140 MPa) and four injection timings (−6°, −9°, −12° and −15° crank angle after top dead center (°CA ATDC)). The experimental results indicated that the addition of cyclopentanol prolongs the ignition delay, shortens the combustion duration and improves the indicated thermal efficiency. As the injection pressure increases or the injection timing advances, the peak combustion pressures (PCPs) and peak heat release rates (PHRRs) increase. Compared to D100, the PCPs and PHRRs of cyclopentanol/diesel fuel blends are lower and decrease with the increase of cyclopentanol ratio. Blending cyclopentanol in diesel is effective in reducing soot emission, and the reduction effect weakens as the injection pressure increases or the injection timing advances. CP10 is superior to CP20 according to the comprehensive evaluation of combustion and emission, especially at the injection timing of −12°CA ATDC under the injection pressure of 140 MPa. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The human population blast has brought several problems related with the overconsumption of a wide range of feedstocks and natural resources conducting to their risk of depletion. The consumption of fossil fuels is an example, with increasing levels of exploitation and negative impacts caused by their use. Anthropogenic activities have triggered the over accumulation of many hazardous substances and wastes which are regarded to be detrimental to life in the Earth and to the various planet ecosystems. There is an urgent need to restore natural resources and unwanted residues and wastes to levels prior the demographic explosion. Microalgal biotechnology appears to be pivotal to achieve this goal in a near future to come. This review presents the current resource problems affecting the Earth and how microalgae are expected to be an important part of the solution, discussing how the production of renewable energy from microalgae can help in an integrated way to mitigate different environmental problems. Microalgae are able to convert wastewaters, CO2 and organic residues in marketable biomass for different uses, including biofuels, converting waste in value. An inventory of current microalgal-based biorefineries in operation as well as a directory of companies, products and applications are also presented. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The number of energy consumers in the world is huge in the present fast-moving scenario, and the entire automotive industry plays a major role in energy consumption. More than 70% of India's energy is dependent heavily on non-renewable fuel imports. Besides that, the cost and demand for the fuel are extremely high. This kind of situation has motivated various researchers to search for an alternative source of energy, which should be renewable and non-polluting. Biofuels have got consideration among other substitute fuels according to their chemical composition and biological feature. In this experimental work, Palmyra palm biofuel is used in the base engine. The Palmyra palm biofuel is mixed with 5% of water and 5% of surfactant (span 80 and tween 80). The base engine was tested with biofuel diesel emulsion with the additives of 50 ppm, 100 ppm, and 150 ppm nano-particles. To reduce heat transfer, the piston top was coated with partially stabilized zirconium (of thickness 0.5 mm) as a thermal barrier with the help of plasma spray methods. The CI engine was tested with 100% Palmyra palm (PP100), 20% Palmyra palm + 70% diesel + 5% water content + 5% of surfactant (PP20), 20% Palmyra palm + 70% diesel + 5% water + 5% of surfactant + 50 ppm Al2O3 (PPNP 50), 20% Palmyra palm + 70% diesel + 5% water + 5% of surfactant + 100 ppm Al2O3 (PPNP 100) and 20% Palmyra palm + 70% diesel + 5% water + 5% of surfactant + 150 ppm Al2O3 (PPNP 150). The engine was tested at various load conditions, and the measurements of performance and emission parameters have been noted down. For the blend 20% Palmyra palm + 70% diesel + 5% water + 5% of surfactant + 150 ppm Al2O3, BTE, in-cylinder pressure, and HRR increased by 5.12%, 4.54%, and 2.63% when compared with the diesel. When correlated to base fuel, the emission of HC, CO, NOx, and Smoke by PPNP 150 were lesser by 21.31%, 32.78%, 12.53%, and 24.44%. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Depletion of fossil fuels and its enormous exhaust emission with conventional engines are the major concerns in the current auto industry. Therefore, there is a need to curtail the exhaust emission with lower specific fuel consumption, which gives a great accomplishment in improvisation of IC engines. After-treatment technologies of an IC engine bring in better control over the exhaust emissions but it obtains poor performance by back pressure. Moreover, integration of various after-treatment techniques bring out additional operating condition control and maintenance cost. However, in-cylinder emission control strategies like advanced combustion mode engines owned a greater significance in acquiring exceptional performance and emission characteristics. Among the advanced combustion mode engines, homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine has the capability to meet future emission norms with enhanced performance. Moreover, it has great ability to run with distinct physicochemical characteristics biofuel by its homogeneous charge preparation techniques. Therefore, improvisation of biofuel powered HCCI engine secures a great potentiality in current auto industry. Accordingly, efforts are required to enhance the characteristic features by optimizing the engine parameters with respect to various biofuels like biodiesel, alcohol, alkane, and ether. The current review article deliberates the insight view on biofuel powered HCCI engine with its homogeneous charge preparation techniques, which critically reviewed their characteristic features. Moreover, an interpretive investigation on HCCI engine with other advanced combustion mode engines disclosed their greater significance and potential outcomes. Besides, the predicaments in the paradigm shift of conventional to HCCI engine is discussed with probable solutions for future enhancements. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In recent years, many studies have been conducted on hybrid solid oxide fuel cell and gas turbine which fed by renewable fuels to reach the high-efficiency power and the low pollution. In this paper, a thermodynamic study based on energy and exergy analyses of a hybrid solid oxide fuel cell and gas turbine hybrid system has been conducted in the presence of reforming with steam, in which the effects of using natural gas and other biofuels including Sewage biogas, Agricultural and Industrial waste biogas, Syngas, Biofuel and Gasified biomass, have been compared to this system. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of each of the mentioned fuels on the performance of individual equipment and the entire system from the thermodynamic perspective. Initially, the modeling and energy balance of all components in the system were carried out in detail. Further, calculating the exergy destruction of all components of the system and the effects of applying different biofuels on the key parameters of the system, including total production power, operating pressure and temperature, compression ratio, the water-to-fuel ratio in the reforming, energy and exergy efficiency, and the amount of irreversibility of each component in the system have been analyzed. To compare more accurately between different fuels, an equal amount of each fuel is considered, and the effect of each fuel system on the hybrid system is analyzed by calculating the operating parameters of the system. By studying the results of modeling, it was determined that natural gas with 879.03 kW produced the highest production capacity and Gasified biomass with 45.44 kW has the least amount of power generation. By studying the thermodynamics of the system, if it is fed with Natural gas, the highest exergy destruction (687.45 kW) occurs and the lowest total exergy destruction rate is related to the system fed by gasified biomass (101.12 kW). Comparing the fuels, it was concluded that the electrical efficiency of the system fed with natural gas has the highest efficiency (72.71%) and Biofuel has the lowest total electrical efficiency (56.6%). Furthermore, by examining the exergy efficiency of the whole system, it was found that Natural gas with the highest efficiency of 61.29% and Gasified biomass with 46.06% the lowest exergy efficiency can be detected. Finally, the effect of the percentage combination of each fuel on the performance of all equipment from the perspective of energy and exergy has been studied. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper investigates the development of domestic and international demand for Indonesian palm oil, in line with national biofuel mandates and established export markets. Domestic demand for palm oil for (i) achieving biodiesel targets and (ii) meeting food and industrial uses will reach 20 million tonnes by 2025, equivalent to 61% of Indonesian production in 2014. Thus, it is possible for Indonesia to be self-sufficient, reaching the biodiesel targets without increasing plantation areas. However, to meet both domestic and international demand, a total 51 million tonnes of crude palm oil will be needed in 2025. This requires additional land of up to 6 million hectares with current yields. The expansion of oil palm plantations in Indonesia has led to debates related to deforestation, threatened biodiversity, and greenhouse gas emissions. We show that increasing agricultural yields could serve the purpose, benefiting biodiesel production while reducing the need for new land. Therefore, we recommend that the ambitious Indonesian biodiesel mandates are pursued in combination with a strategy for increased productivity in palm oil production, utilization of degraded land to contain greenhouse gas emissions, and use of palm oil biomass residues for energy production. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Biodiesel is a fuel that has numerous benefits over traditional petrodiesel. The transesterification process is the most popular method for biodiesel production from various sources, categorized as first, second and third generation biodiesel depending on the source. The transesterification process is subject to a variety of factors that can be taken into account to improve biodiesel yield. One of the factors is catalyst type and concentration, which plays a significant role in the transesterification of biodiesel sources. At present, chemical and biological catalysts are being investigated and each catalyst has its advantages and disadvantages. Recently, nanocatalysts have drawn researchers’ attention to the efficient production of biodiesel. This article discusses recent work on the role of several nanocatalysts in the transesterification reaction of various sources in the development of biodiesel. A large number of literature from highly rated journals in scientific indexes is reviewed, including the most recent publications. Most of the authors reported that nanocatalysts show an important influence regarding activity and selectivity. This study highlights that in contrast to conventional catalysts, the highly variable surface area of nanostructure materials favours interaction between catalysts and substrates that efficiently boost the performance of products. Finally, this analysis provides useful information to researchers in developing and processing cost-effective biodiesel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present work, the biofuels were prepared from chicken slaughter waste, broiler excrete, and fish waste through the pyrolysis process. The effect of prepared biofuels was identified and evaluated in terms of the emission parameters on a four-stroke, single-cylinder diesel engine test bench. Customized fuels are prepared by blending of oil derived from chicken slaughter waste, broiler excrete, and fish waste at 10% volume with diesel at 90% volume to conduct the experiments. This oil is restricted to 10% volume for blending with diesel owing to its inferior heating value. This work also focuses on reducing the direct environmental pollution by preventing the dumping process of slaughter waste, broiler excrete, and fish waste which causes bad odor and soil pollution. The influence of oil derived from chicken slaughter waste, broiler excrete, and fish waste and diesel blend was compared with conventional diesel. Test results demonstrated that the CO (30.52%), HC (25.41%), and NO (22.84%) emissions of chicken slaughter/broiler excrete/fish waste biofuels and diesel blends reduced extensively than diesel at full load. Further, the CO2 emissions of fish waste and diesel blend are increased by 30.52% at 25% load condition, and at 100% load, it increased by 23.80% than diesel. The attained results shall play a significant role to execute analysis concern to various alternative fuels to lower engine emission patterns. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In this work, the conversion of Enteromorpha clathrata into bio-oil through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) was investigated under different preparation conditions. A two-step reaction method was compared with single-step reaction. At a high temperature, bio-oil produced through the two-step hydrothermal reaction displayed slight changes in yield, but solid residue rate was low. The liquid-to-material ratio of the optimal preparation condition was 40/4 (mL/g). Bio-oil produced in each experiment at this ratio was further analyzed using GC/MS. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) quantitative calculation was used in analyzing and proving the possible reaction path of the conversion of furan compounds to aromatic compounds during a direct high-temperature liquefaction process. Results revealed that the two-step method can ensure a high bio-oil yield, while preventing the occurrence of side reactions caused by long-term high-temperature reactions, and improve the bio-oil quality. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Despite the fast development of various energy harvesting and storage devices, their judicious integration into efficient, autonomous, and sustainable wearable systems has not been widely explored. Here, we introduce the concept and design principles of e-textile microgrids by demonstrating a multi-module bioenergy microgrid system. Unlike earlier hybrid wearable systems, the presented e-textile microgrid relies solely on human activity to work synergistically, harvesting biochemical and biomechanical energy using sweat-based biofuel cells and triboelectric generators, and regulating the harvested energy via supercapacitors for high-power output. Through energy budgeting, the e-textile system can efficiently power liquid crystal displays continuously or a sweat sensor-electrochromic display system in pulsed sessions, with half the booting time and triple the runtime in a 10-min exercise session. Implementing “compatible form factors, commensurate performance, and complementary functionality” design principles, the flexible, textile-based bioenergy microgrid offers attractive prospects for the design and operation of efficient, sustainable, and autonomous wearable systems. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - In this paper, cloisite 30B (CL) was converted to tosylated cloisite (TCL) as new heterofunctional support. Lipase from Candida rugosa was covalently immobilized on the TCL (TCLL) and used to produce biodiesel from waste frying oil (WFO). The effects of reaction time and temperature, the molar ratio of methanol/oil, and the water content on the biodiesel yield were also explored. The hydrolytic activity of TCLL was 1.96 ± 0.04 U mg−1, with the immobilization yield of 93.6% and expressed activity of 90.2%. The maximum yield of biodiesel (97.1 ± 1.1%) was obtained at 50 °C for 8 h with a 15:1 M ratio of methanol to WFO and water content 10 wt%. The features of produced biodiesel, such as acid value, iodine value, density, and viscosity, met the specifications in the reported standard test methods. After 24 h incubation at 80 °C, the relative yield of biodiesel for TCLL was 20.3%, while the relative yield for the free enzyme was almost zero. The relative yield of biodiesel for TCLL and free lipase was 70.6% and 33.4%, respectively, after 30 days of storage. Also, TCLL showed a relative yield of 61.3% in the biodiesel production after being used for 10 cycles. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The major hurdles causing difficulties in mechanized transportation are the depletion of fossil fuels and the high cost of alternative plant-based substrates for producing biofuels. To solve these issues, biofuels were emerged as effective alternatives to reduce pollution caused by the emission of greenhouse gases. Among biofuels, biobutanol is gaining attention as a feasible, renewable, cost-effective, alternative fuel. But the usages of conventional agricultural crops as feedstock are sensitive and controversial due to the growing concern over the availability of food worldwide. Microalgae are an excellent resource to overcome these challenges, which grows on both the sea and freshwater. Microalgae reducing their land usage with agriculture, and there is no food and fuel conflict exist. In addition, microalgae utilize inorganic carbon from the atmosphere for growth; hence they can reduce the emission levels as well as produce clean energy. Therefore, microalgae as third-generation feedstock came into practice due to their fast growth rate and higher carbohydrate content. The main focus of the present review is to discuss in detail about the major challenges faced as a feedstock, genetic engineering strategies adopted and future perspectives to improve the production of biobutanol from microalgae. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Aquaculture plays an important role in human nutrition and economic development but is often expanded to the detriment of the natural environment. Several research projects, aimed at cultivating microalgae in aquaculture wastewaters (AWWs) to reduce organic loads and minerals, along with the production of microalgal cell mass and metabolic products, are underway. Microalgal cell mass is of high nutritional value and is regarded as a candidate to replace, partially at least, the fish meal in the fish feed. Also, microalgal cell mass is considered as a feedstock in the bio-fuel manufacture, as well as a source of high-added value metabolic products. The production of these valuable products can be combined with the reuse of AWWs in the light of environmental concerns related with the aquaculture sector. Many research papers published in the last decade demonstrate that plenty of microalgae species are able to efficiently grow in AWWs, mainly derived from fish and shrimp farms, and produce valuable metabolites reducing the AWW pollutant load. We conclude that bio-remediation of AWWs combining with the production of microalgae cell mass and specific metabolites is probably the most convenient and economical solution for AWWs management and can contribute to the sustainable growth of the aquaculture. © FEMS 2020.

AB  - Sustainable development is the common goal of the current concepts of bioeconomy and circular economy. In this sense, the biorefineries platforms are a strategic factor to increase the bioeconomy in the economic balance. The incorporation of renewable sources to produce fuels, chemicals, and energy, includes sustainability, reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG), and creating more manufacturing jobs fostering the advancement of regional and social systems by implementing the comprehensive use of available biomass, due to its low costs and high availability. This paper describes the emerging biorefinery strategies to produce fuels (bio-ethanol and γ-valerolactone) and energy (pellets and steam), compared with the currently established biorefineries designed for fuels, pellets, and steam. The focus is on the state of the art of biofuels and energy production and environmental factors, as well as a discussion about the main conversion technologies, production strategies, and barriers. Through the implementation of biorefineries platforms and the evaluation of low environmental impact technologies and processes, new sustainable production strategies for biofuels and energy can be established, making these biobased industries into more competitive alternatives, and improving the economy of the current value chains. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The sustainability of bioenergy is varying on a case-by-case basis. It considerably depends on the source of biomass, management practices (plantation, harvesting, conversion technologies, supply chain, etc.) as well as the assessment boundary and assumptions. This study summarises the carbon emissions footprint (CF) flow of bioenergy by considering the possible sources and system boundary, particularly on the CF of biogenic carbon and secondary effects. The assessment framework has been applied to a demonstrated case study identifying the upper limits of global warming potential of biogenic carbon emission (GWPbio) and secondary effects contribution where the bioenergy is still superior to the coal, natural gas and gasoline. The circumstances where the other energy source alternatives could have a lower CF than bioenergy are highlighted. For example, coal and natural gas are the selection (lower CF) if the bioelectricity is subjected to the GWPbio higher than 0.57-0.74 and 0.18-0.34. CF of bioheat is higher than the heat generated by natural gas when the GWPbio is more than 0.04-0.40. Gasoline is the selection when the GWPbio of biofuel is higher than 0.12-0.42. The validity of carbon neutrality assumption of bioenergy possesses a more decisive role in the overall selection of bioenergy compared to the assessed secondary effects such as soil organic carbon changes. This study emphasises the importance of a rigorous CF accounting for bioenergy to support the equitable decision making. Novelty Statement: The novel contributions of this study are: Summarising of the direct and secondary (soil organic carbon changes - above and belowground, biochar application) effects in accounting the CF for a comprehensive assessment framework. Identifying the CF, integrated with biogenic and non-biogenic accounting, of bioenergy from energy crops and waste/residual. Comparing the identified CF of bioenergy to the other energy alternatives (fossil-based). © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Currently, the supply of diminishing fossil fuel reserves, and the rise in challenges in environmental, political and economic consequences have caused the great concerns in the development of modern society; these have forced the policy-makers and researchers to look for the renewable and green energy sources. Deemed as a promising renewable alternative to traditional fossil fuels, 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF, chemical formula C6H8O)-a derivative of furan-has the potential to relieve the growing shortage of fossil fuels while satisfying the increase in global energy demand and minimizing the adverse effects of climate change. DMF can be used as a clean source of liquid transportation biofuel given the fact that it is directly obtained from biomass-derived carbohydrates. In reviewing current DMF production methods, this review paper analyzes and presents the comparison of catalytic performance in the conversion of biomass into DMF. In addition, the applicability of DMF in spark-ignition (SI) engines is thoroughly analyzed based on the spray and flame, combustion, performance, and emission characteristics of SI engines running on DMF compared with ethanol and gasoline. More interestingly, the knocking, lubrication, and wear characteristics in SI engines fueled with DMF are also evaluated and discussed. Nonetheless, further investigation on optimization strategies on DMF production process should be conducted prior to the initiation of large-scale commercialization as well as the application of DMF to real-world SI engines.

AB  - This paper reviews the different cultivation conditions such as temperature, light intensity, and pH for enhancing lipid accumulation for green fuel production. The various levels of physical factors on the lipid yield and growth of algae with respect to biofuel production have been discussed in this review. Initially, the bottlenecks in microalgal biodiesel production have been highlighted and the need for optimal conditions for lipid accumulation have been analyzed. Further, the impact of the cultivation conditions such as light intensity/color, temperature, and CO2 concentration were comprehensively interpreted to understand how lipid accumulation in microalgae can be enhanced in the perspective of biofuel production. Besides, all the recent advancements and experimental works on biomass and lipid production in microalgae concerning the effect of different light intensities and color, temperature regimes, CO2 concentration and pH ranges are discussed and summarized. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study investigated the engine performance and emission characteristics of biodiesel blends with combined Graphene oxide nanoplatelets (GNPs) and 10% v/v dimethyl carbonate (DMC) as fuel additives as well as analysed the tribological characteristics of those blends. 10% by volume DMC was mixed with 30% palm oil biodiesel blends with diesel. Three different concentrations (40, 80 and 120 ppm) of GNPs were added to these blends via the ultrasonication process to prepare the nanofuels. Sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) surfactant was added to improve the stability of these blends. GNPs were characterised using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), while the viscosity of nanofuels was investigated by rheometer. UV-spectrometry was used to determine the stability of these nanoplatelets. A ratio of 1:4 GNP: SDS was found to produce maximum stability in biodiesel. Performance and emissions characteristics of these nanofuels have been investigated in a four-stroke compression ignition engine. The maximum reduction in BSFC of 5.05% and the maximum BTE of 22.80% was for B30GNP40DMC10 compared to all other tested blends. A reduction in HC (25%) and CO (4.41%) were observed for B30DMC10, while a reduction in NOx of 3.65% was observed for B30GNP40DMC10. The diesel-biodiesel fuel blends with the addition of GNP exhibited a promising reduction in the average coefficient of friction 15.05%, 8.68% and 3.61% for 120, 80 and 40 ppm concentrations compared to B30. Thus, combined GNP and DMC showed excellent potential for utilisation in diesel engine operation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Nowadays, worldwide, many countries are engaged in reducing the vehicular exhaust emissions from diesel engines as diesel engines are the main source of power in various transport applications. Biofuels obtained from various feedstocks serve as a better alternative fuel in CI engines because of its emission reducing capabilities. The major drawback in the usage of biofuels in CI engine is the rise in the formation of nitrogen oxides which would be harmful to human health. WCO biofuel was processed using trans-esterification technique and the contents available were analyzed using gas chromatography mass. spectroscopy (GCMS). Four different blends, namly B100, B60, B40, and B20 were made. The physio-chemical properties of the prepared test fuels were identified using ASTM standards. The investigation on the characterisation of performance, combustion, sound and emission of the test engine was done. Fuel combustion modeling was done using ANSYS Fluent for diesel, WCO biofuel and best suited blend obtained from experimental results. From both the simulated and the experimental results, it was found that B20 blend fuel would be best suited to the test engine with a maximum reduction of 17% in unburned hydrocarbon (HC), 30% in carbonmonooxide (CO), 14.08% in smoke, 7.35% in carbondioxide (CO2) and 16.46% increase in NOx emission respectively. With an intention to reduce NOx emission in the selected B20 blend fuel, EGR at three rates, namely (5%, 10%, and 15%) were utilized. Again, the experiments were conducted with varying EGR rates for B20 blend fuel. A good percentage of reduction in NOx was obtained with increase in EGR rates. But other emissions like CO, HC, smoke, and CO2 emissions were found to increase with rise in EGR rates. Thus, a comparison was made with three rates of EGR emission values with all types of test fuels to optimize the EGR rate leading into the inlet charge. 10% EGR rate gave a maximum reduction of 16.34% in NOx emission without affecting much in the emissions like HC, CO, Smoke, and CO2 along with a small drop in performance. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, we conducted proof-of-concept research towards the simultaneous treatment of livestock wastewater and the generation of high-quality biodiesel, through microalgae technology. Both original (OPE) and anaerobically-digested (DPE) piggery effluents were investigated for the culture of the microalgae, Desmodesmus sp. EJ8-10. After 14 days’ cultivation, the dry biomass from microalgae cultivated in OPE increased from an initial value of 0.01 g/L to 0.33–0.39 g/L, while those growing in DPE only achieved a final dried mass of 0.15–0.35 g/L, under similar initial ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) concentrations. The significantly higher microalgal biomass production achieved in the OPE medium may have been supported by the abundance of both macronutrient, such as phosphorus (P), and of micronutrients, such as trace elements, present in the OPE, which may not been present in similar quantities in the DPE. However, a higher lipid content was observed (19.4–28%) in microalgal cells from DPE cultures than those (18.7–22.3%) from OPE cultures. Moreover, the fatty acid compositions in the microalgae cultured in DPE contained high levels of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and total C16–C18 acids, which would afford a superior potential for high-quality biodiesel production. The N/P ratio (15.4:1) in OPE was much closer to that indicated by previous studies to be the most suitable (16:1) for microalgae growth, when compared with that determined from the DPE culture medium. This may facilitate protein synthesis in the algal cells and induce a lower accumulation of lipids. Based on these findings, we proposed a new flowsheet for sustainable livestock waste management. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study evaluated in-situ co-transesterification of wet spent coffee ground (SCG)/microalgae mixture for enhanced biodiesel production. SCG and microalgae showed lipid contents of 16.0 and 23.6 wt%, respectively. A total of 27 transesterification runs were performed using wet SCG:algae (1:1, w/w) at different temperatures, times, and solvent ratios. Box-Behnken quadratic model suggested 198 °C, 6 mL solvent g−1 biomass, and reaction time of 132 min as the optimum conditions for maximum biodiesel yield. At different SCG/microalgae blend ratios, pure microalgae showed the highest biodiesel yield of 20.15 wt%. Increase of SCG ratio resulted in significant reduction in the biodiesel yield, reaching the lowest value of 11.2 wt% using pure SCG. On the other hand, SCG showed better biodiesel characteristics than microalgae regarding iodine value, cetane number, and oxidation stability. The present results confirmed that SCG-algae blend results in dual effect of enhancing biodiesel yield and quality, comparing to the individual transesterification. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work analyses the performance and emission characteristics of biofuelled compression ignition (C.I) engine with the implementation of an antioxidant. Using the transesterification process with sodium hydroxide as a catalyst, the beef tallow methyl ester (BTME) was obtained from the beef tallow oil. Poor physical properties of biodiesel (beef tallow oil (BTO)) namely high viscosity and density cause atomization problems leading to higher smoke, hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions. The purpose of this work is to enhance the performance aspects, to limit smoke emissions from BTO operation and to examine the possibility of direct use of neat BTO in CI engine. This research paves a way of investing the impact of binary blends of BHA and BTO on the research engine. The experiments were conducted on a single-cylinder four-stroke C.I engine using the following fuel compositions: 20% of BTME mixed with 80% diesel (B20), 1000 ppm mono-phenolic antioxidant (butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA)) mixed with the blends of B20 (B20 + BHA), and 100% diesel. Based on the experimental results, it was found that the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) increases by 1.8% and the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) decreases by 2.5% for the fuel blend B20 + BHA when compared with that for B20 fuel blend. Compared with the B20 blend, the blend B20 + BHA emits 12.2% lesser nitrogen oxide due to breaking chain reactions, scavenging the initiating radicals and reducing the concentration of reactive radicals. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - An ever increasing demand for animal protein products has posed serious challenges for managing the increasing quantities of livestock manure. The choice of treatment technologies is still a complicated task and considerable debates over this issue still continue. To build a clearer picture of manure treatment framework, this study was conducted to review the most frequently employed manure management technologies from their state of the art, challenges, sustainability, environmental regulations and incentives, and improvement strategies perspectives. The results showed that most treatment technologies have focused on the solid fraction of manure while the liquid fraction still remains a potential environmental threat. Compared to other waste to energy solutions, anaerobic digestion is the most mature technology to upgrade manure's organic matter into renewable energy, however the problems associated with high investment costs, operating parameters, manure collection, and digestate management have hindered its developments in rural areas in developing countries. Bio-oil production through hydrothermal liquification is also a promising solution, as it can directly convert the wet manure into biofuel. However, lipid-poor nature of manure, operational difficulties, and the need for downstream process to remove nitrogenous compounds from the final product necessitate further research. Livestock manure management (both solid and liquid fractions) under biorefinery approach seems an inevitable solution for future sustainable development to meet circular bioeconomy requirements.

AB  - The current study aims to evaluate the performance and emission characteristics of a modified common rail direct injection (CRDI) diesel engine fueled by Ricinus communis biodiesel (RCME20), diesel (80%), and their blends with strontium-zinc oxide (Sr@ZnO) nanoparticle additives. The Sr@ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized using aqueous precipitation of zinc acetate dehydrate and strontium nitrate. Several characterization tests were performed to study the morphology and content of synthesized Sr@ZnO nanoparticles. The Sr@ZnO nanoparticles were steadily blended with RCME20-diesel fuel blend in mass fractions of 30, 60 and 90 ppm using a magnetic stirrer and ultrasonication process. For a long term stability of nanoparticles, Cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) surfactant was added. The physicochemical properties of the fuel blends were measured using ASTM standards. The CRDI engine was operated at two compression ratios 17.5 and 19.5, 1000 bar injection pressure, 23.5°BTDC injection timing and constant speed. For enhanced swirl and turbulence, and improved spray quality lateral swirl combustion chamber and 6-hole fuel injector were used. The compression ratio of 19.5 and 60 ppm of Sr@ZnO nano-additives showed overall enhancement in engine characteristics compared to RCME20 fuel. The engine characteristics such as BTE, HRR and cylinder pressure increased by 20.83%, 24.35% and 9.55%, and BSFC, ID, CD, smoke, CO, HC and CO2 reduced by 20.07%, 20.64%, 14.5%, 27.90%, 47.63%, 26.81%, and 34.9%, while slight increase in NOx for all nanofuel blends was observed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd
